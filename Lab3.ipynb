    "1. **`detoxify_text` Function**:\n",
    "   - This function filters out a predefined list of offensive or problematic terms from the generated text.\n",
    "   - The `toxic_phrases` list contains terms that are considered inappropriate or insensitive in various contexts, such as \"illegal alien,\" \"crippled,\" \"lunatic,\" and others.\n",
    "   - For each term in `toxic_phrases`, the function checks if the term appears in the input text. If found, it replaces the term with \"[filtered],\" effectively detoxifying the text.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **`generate_and_detoxify` Function**:\n",
    "   - This function combines two steps: it first generates a summary using the `generate_summary` function, then detoxifies the summary using the `detoxify_text` function.\n",
    "   - The detoxified summary is returned, ensuring that the final output does not contain any problematic language.\n",

    "3. **Iterating Through Fake Case Law**:\n",
    "   - A loop iterates through the `fdf` dataframe, which contains fake case law documents generated by AI.\n",
    "   - For each case law document, the `generate_and_detoxify` function is applied to produce a detoxified summary.\n",

    "- The `detoxify_text` function successfully removes or replaces inappropriate terms from the generated summaries, ensuring that the output is respectful and neutral.\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This project focused on building and testing a case law summarizer using a fine-tuned BART model. Throughout the development process, we explored various steps, from cleaning and splitting the text to generating, detoxifying, and evaluating summaries. We successfully created a pipeline that processes large legal documents, generates concise summaries, and filters out potentially harmful language using a custom detoxification function.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Accomplishments:\n",
    "1. **Data Processing**: We split the legal texts into manageable chunks, ensuring they could be processed efficiently by the model without exceeding token limits.\n",
    "2. **Summarization**: Using the BART model, we generated summaries for these legal documents. This is a key step toward reducing the complexity of legal texts for easier understanding.\n",
    "3. **Detoxification**: We implemented a detoxification step that filters out inappropriate or offensive language from the generated summaries, ensuring that the output adheres to ethical language standards.\n",
    "4. **Evaluation**: We evaluated the model’s performance, observing that while the summarizer performed well on shorter texts, further fine-tuning is required to improve the consistency and quality of summaries for more complex or lengthy documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Future Work:\n",
    "While the model performed adequately for this scope, there are several areas where it can be improved and expanded:\n",
    "- **Fine-Tuning**: In future iterations, we will look into further fine-tuning the model, adjusting hyperparameters to improve performance on more complex legal documents.\n",
    "- **Detoxification Enhancements**: The detoxification process could be made more robust by incorporating a wider range of sensitive terms or leveraging external tools for toxicity detection.\n",
    "- **Scaling**: We might revisit this project later to explore a larger-scale deployment, potentially handling more diverse case law datasets and expanding to other legal domains.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, this project lays a solid foundation for future developments in legal text summarization, opening the door for enhancements and broader applications in the legal field. With additional training, detoxification improvements, and larger datasets, this project has the potential to be an essential tool for legal professionals and researchers.\n"
