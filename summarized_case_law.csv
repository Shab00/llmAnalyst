ORDER
(The Tribunal Procedure (First-tier Tribunal) (General Regulatory Chamber) Rules 2009)
It is recorded that:
The Tribunal issued a stay of proceedings at the request of the Appellant due to ill-health on 2024-January-10.  This followed on from previous stays for the same reason.  The stay expired on 2024-February-29.
No application was made to lift to stay and the stay lapsed.  The Appellant confirmed on 2024-March-6 that he was not making an application to lift the stay.
The Order dated 2024-December-23 did not make any decisions on the Appellant’s appeals/applications but confirmed that the stay had lapsed and no application had been made to lift the stay.   The Order was issued to confirm administratively that the appeals had lapsed due to inactivity/being abandoned.
The Appellant has made an application dated 2024-December-26 to reinstate his appeals/applications indicating that he believed the stay ended in February 2024 and that he wished for his cases to be active again.
The Tribunal has applied the overriding objective to the application and has reviewed each application/appeal individually.
Where separate directions are made that require the action from parties, they will be replicated in a separate Order to assist the Appellant.  A summary will be provided in this Order.  The Tribunal apologises about the length of this document but the Appellant has many appeals and applications to be considered.
It is ORDERED that:
The following appeals EA.2018.0239.GDPR, EA.2018.0240.GDPR, EA.2019.0022.GDPR, EA.2019.0023.GDPR, EA.2019.0033.GDPR, EA.2021.0130.GDPR, EA.2022.0206.GDPR and EA.2022.0420.GDPR are not reinstated and will be struck out under Rule 8(2)(a).
The reasons are included in this document.
Appeal EA.2021.0144 is not reinstated and will be struck out.
A separate decision notice is provided.
The following appeals EA.2023.0083 and EA.2023.0251 are reinstated. Case management directions are provided in a separate document.
The Appellant has an appeal FT/EA/2024/0424 which is listed for hearing on 2025-April-9 by CVP but also has a pending strike out application to be considered.  A summary Order has been issued to confirm directions already given.  That application will be reviewed on 2025-January-20.
The application for a review of the Order dated 2023-June-8 in case number EA.2023.0057 is refused.
The application to certify a contempt in EA.2023.0057 is dismissed.
A separate decision notice is provided.
Reasons:
The Appellant’s appeals and applications were stayed between 2023-September-7 until 2024-February-29 due to his ill-health.  The Appellant emailed the Tribunal on 28th February to update the Tribunal regarding his health.  He did not clarify his position regarding the stay or the progress of his cases.  On the 2023-March-6 the Appellant emailed the ICO’s office and said that “I have not sought to make a further application to extend the stay at this time.”  That email was sent to the Tribunal.
The Appellant was not in contact with the Tribunal between April 2024 and December 2024 in regard to his stayed appeals, the perception of which was that the Appellant had abandoned his appeals.  It appears that the Tribunal had issued a further appeal/application issued on 2024-November-19 under case number FT/EA/2024/0424.  A strike out application has been made in this case and is awaiting a response from the Appellant.
The Appellant has confirmed in his application that he sought for his applications and appeals to be reinstated; and a review of the outstanding cases has taken place.  Whilst there are matters that can proceed, there are applications which are considered suitable to be struck out, either because an application has been made for strike out or because the Tribunal itself considers that they cannot proceed.  Those matters are the appeals marked as GDPR.
Details of the outstanding GDPR cases that the Appellant sought to reinstate -
EA.2018.0239.GDPR
The Appellant made an application to the Tribunal after receiving an outcome from the ICO on 2017-August-31 following a data complaint.  The Appellant complains about the investigation and the outcome.
EA.2018.0240.GDPR
The Appellant made an application to the Tribunal after receiving an outcome from the ICO on 2018-October-17 following a data complaint.  The Appellant complains about the investigation and the outcome.
EA.2019.0022.GDPR
The Appellant made an application to the Tribunal after receiving an outcome from the ICO on 2018-December-18 following a data complaint.  The Appellant complains about the investigation and the outcome.
EA.2019.0023.GDPR
The Appellant made an application to the Tribunal after receiving an outcome from the ICO on 2019-January-14 following a data complaint.  The Appellant complains about the investigation and the outcome.
EA.2019.0033.GDPR
The Appellant made an application to the Tribunal on 2019-January-8 before receiving an outcome from the ICO on 2019-January-30 following a data complaint made on 2018-September-24 which was being investigated by the ICO.  His application was unclear as he had not received an outcome and did not seek progression, but referred to adding this case to the other cases he had to show a chronology of complaints against the ICO.
EA.2021.0130.GDPR
The Appellant made an application for an order to progress a data complaint after receiving an outcome on 2021-May-5 to the effect that the ICO did not consider his concerns to be within his remit and that the organisation concerned did not infringe data protection law.  This was after an investigation and significant liaison between the Appellant and the ICO.
EA.2022.0206.GDPR
The Appellant made an application to the Tribunal after receiving an outcome from the ICO on 2022-June-28 following a data complaint.  The Appellant complains about the ICO, corruption in the Tribunals and his human rights.
The Respondent has applied to strike out the appeal under Rule 8(3)(c) and the Appellant has responded to that application.
EA.2022.0420.GDPR
The Appellant made an application to the Tribunal after receiving an outcome from the ICO on 2022-June-28 following a data complaint.  Whilst there were ongoing conversation between the Appellant and ICO about implementation, the complaint had been concluded.
The Respondent has applied to strike out the appeal under Rule 8(3)(c) and the Appellant has responded to that application.
There is a widespread misunderstanding about the role of the Commissioner when handling data protection complaints.  The Commissioner retains wide discretion as to whether to investigate and what steps should be taken. The Court of Appeal at paragraph 80 of R (Delo) v The Information Commissioner [2023] EWCA Civ 1141 described the remit of the Commissioner as follows:
“the legislative scheme requires the Commissioner to receive and consider a complaint and then provides the Commissioner with a broad discretion as to whether to conduct a further investigation and, if so, to what extent. I would further hold,…. that having done that much the Commissioner is entitled to conclude that it is unnecessary to determine whether there has been an infringement but sufficient to reach and express a view about the likelihood that this is so and to take no further action. By doing so the Commissioner discharges his duty to inform the complainant of the outcome of their complaint.”
And at paragraph 94 –
“It must be legitimate for the Commissioner, when deciding how to deploy the available resources, to take account not only of his own view of the likely outcome of further investigation and the likely merits, but also of any alternative methods of enforcement that are available to the data subject.”
Scores of applicants apply for orders under section 166 which are in fact appeals against the outcome of the Commissioner’s outcome.  They are often accompanied by long submissions, and even after strike out are followed by applications to review or even permissions to appeal.  These applications utilise considerable resources of this Tribunal and the Commissioner.  It is also the often the case, as it is here, that the same applicant makes repeated applications to the Tribunal despite having been provided with a comprehensive reasons previously why such an application cannot progress.
Even in cases where an outcome is yet to be provided at the time of the application, the application for an order to progress is often responded to by an outcome from the Commissioner, which is precisely what the process is designed to achieve – an outcome for the complainant.
The leading Upper Tribunal case on section 166 applications is Killock & others v Information Commissioner [2022] 1 WLR 2241.  The High Court also considered similar issues in R (Delo) v Information Commissioner [2023] 1 WLR 1327 and the Court of Appeal considered that High Court decision in R (Delo) v The Information Commissioner [2023] EWCA Civ 1141.
More senior judges than the First Tier have consistently given guidance about applications under section 166 of the Data Protection Act 2018 which need not be set out in full here but the following core principles are that –
The Order sought is an order to progress a complaint; once a complaint has an outcome, the First Tier Tribunal cannot issue an order to progress a complaint which has concluded.
Para 74 of Killock – “The remedy in s.166 is limited to the mischiefs identified in s.166(1)… those are all procedural failings. They are (in broad summary) the failure to respond appropriately to a complaint, the failure to provide timely information in relation to a complaint and the failure to provide a timely complaint outcome”. And the Court of Appeal in Delo at paragraph 64 – “An “outcome” must be the end point of the Commissioner’s “handling” of a complaint”.
The First Tier Tribunal has no appellate jurisdiction to overturn or review the outcome of the Commissioner.
Para 74 of Killock - “on an application under s.166, the Tribunal will not be concerned and has no power to deal with the merits of the complaint or its outcome”.
The Tribunal has no supervisory function over the investigation of the Commissioner.  Judicial review is the correct application when appealing against the discretion of a public body.
Paragraph 66 of the Court of Appeal’s decision in Delo - … the Commissioner has a broad discretion to decide the intensity of any investigation, according to the facts of the matter: “the investigation following a complaint should be carried out, subject to judicial review, to the extent that is appropriate in the specific case…[this] plainly contemplates a case in which the supervisory authority does “act on” or handle a complaint but having done so ends up taking no action upon it.
The Tribunal has no separate power to investigate or order a remedy regarding data processing complaints.  Complainants have a remedy under section 167 of the DPA 2018 to bring proceedings against the data controller.
There are judicial remedies in accordance with the GDPR which allows law makers to provide for the nature of those remedies.  The remedies provided are in the High Court for judicial review of the Commissioner, civil action is available against the data processor in the County Court under section 167 of the DPA 2018 and there is a complaints procedure against the Commissioner in the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman,
The Commissioner has six months to investigate the complaint.  At the end of that six months, the applicant has 28 days to make an application for an order to progress.
Attempts to read into paragraph 83 and 84 of the Killock judgment a freestanding power for the First Tier Tribunal to oversee a concluded complaint by directing that further “appropriate steps” are taken is misconceived.  Those paragraphs must be seen in the context of the discussion about when the First Tier Tribunal is empowered to make such an order which is when a complaint is pending.
Much reliance is asserted on paragraph 87 and the references to winding the clock back -
“Moreover, s.166 is a forward-looking provision, concerned with remedying ongoing procedural defects that stand in the way of the timely resolution of a complaint. The Tribunal is tasked with specifying appropriate “steps to respond” and not with assessing the appropriateness of a response that has already been given (which would raise substantial regulatory questions susceptible only to the supervision of the High Court). It will do so in the context of securing the progress of the complaint in question. We do not rule out circumstances in which a complainant, having received an outcome to his or her complaint under s.165(b), may ask the Tribunal to wind back the clock and to make an order for an appropriate step to be taken in response to the complaint under s.166(2)(a). However, should that happen, the Tribunal will cast a critical eye to assure itself that the complainant is not using the s.166 process to achieve a different complaint outcome”.
The judgement is clear that it is not for the First Tier Tribunal to regulate the Commissioner but it could not be said that there would not be cases where the First Tier Tribunal could intervene.  Such a case was identified in the judgment where the Commissioner refused to investigate at all by incorrect reliance on Service Standard.  As paragraph 116 explains – “In our judgment, by misconstruing and misapplying her own Service Standards, and thereby simply declining to investigate the complaints at all, the Commissioner did not take such steps as were appropriate to respond to the complaints.”  In Delo, it was suggested that judicial review was the appropriate remedy for a failure to accept a complaint is judicial review (paragraph 66).  There is then a conflict between the UT in Killock who were acting as a first instance Tribunal and Delo as to whether it was the First Tier Tribunal or the Upper Tribunal in judicial review proceedings who could make an order for an investigation to take place when one had been refused.  Respectfully, it is suggested that in the light of the broad discretion of the Commissioner to decide whether an investigation should in act be undertaken, that any direction over the exercise of that discretion is a matter for judicial review and not the First Tier Tribunal.  The role of the First Tier Tribunal is limited to bringing a timely conclusion to an investigation where one has not been concluded.
The reference to “winding the clock back” must be seen in context as the judgment as a whole and the subsequent judicial dicta on the scope of section 166 applications that has clarified the remit of the Tribunal.  For example Mostyn J in the High Court in R (Delo) v Information Commissioner [2023] 1 WLR 1327, paragraph 57 –
""The treatment of such complaints by the commissioner, as before, remains within his exclusive discretion. He decides the scale of an investigation of a complaint to the extent that he thinks appropriate. He decides therefore whether an investigation is to be short, narrow and light or whether it is to be long, wide and heavy. He decides what weight, if any, to give to the ability of a data subject to apply to a court against a data controller or processor under article 79. And then he decides whether he shall, or shall not, reach a conclusive determination...”.  This was upheld in the Court of Appeal [2023] EWCA Civ 1141.
More recently in the Upper Tribunal in Cortes v Information Commissioner (UA-2023-001298-GDPA) which applied both Killock and Delo in confirming that the nature of section 166 is that of a limited procedural provision only.
“The Tribunal is tasked with specifying appropriate “steps to respond” and not with assessing the appropriateness of a response that has already been given (which would raise substantial regulatory questions susceptible only to the supervision of the High Court)….As such, the fallacy in the Applicant’s central argument is laid bare. If Professor Engelman is correct, then any data subject who is dissatisfied with the outcome of their complaint to the Commissioner could simply allege that it was reached after an inadequate investigation, and thereby launch a collateral attack on the outcome itself with the aim of the complaint decision being re-made with a different outcome. Such a scenario would be inconsistent with the purport of Article 78.2, the heading and text of section 166 and the thrust of the decisions and reasoning in both Killock and Veale and R (on the application of Delo). It would also make a nonsense of the jurisdictional demarcation line between the FTT under section 166 and the High Court on an application for judicial review.” (paragraph 33).
All of the Appellant’s applications fall foul of the above principles either because they are applications made alter an outcome, were made pending an outcome which has been provided or seek for the Tribunal to regulate the investigation and conclusion of the Commissioner.  This Tribunal has a very limited power in data protection complaints to hurry them along, the Tribunal cannot entertain applications that it has no power to consider or make orders that it has no jurisdiction to do so.  Consideration of such matter wastes the previous resources of the First Tier Tribunal and detracts from appeals and applications that require the attention of the Tribunal.
The Appellant has been given an opportunity to respond to the strike out application on a few occasions and has not persuaded the Tribunal that it has power to consider his applications.  The Tribunal is able to consider striking out an application even though the Commissioner has not requested strike out as part of its case management functions.  It is noted that some of these applications were made shortly after the 2018 came into effect; the Commissioner is much more adept now, and with the benefit of the case-law, to make timely applications for strike out in such cases.
The GDPR cases listed above are struck out on the basis that the Tribunal has no power to consider those applications.  That is an Order that the First Tier Tribunal must make in these circumstances. As the applications cannot be properly made, there are not going to be successful.  I additionally strike out the applications as having no reasonable prospect of success.
Other cases that the Appellant seeks to reinstate –
EA.2021.0144
This appeal was submitted on 2021-June-14.  The Appellant was given an opportunity to respond to the Tribunals’ concerns that it did not have jurisdiction to consider his appeal, noting that the information requested was provided and the only issue the ICO considered was the Public Authority’s provision of information outside of the 20 working day time limit.  The Appellant responded to those concerns. A separate decision notice has been issued for this case.
EA.2023.0083
This appeal was received on 2023-February-14 against the decision of the ICO in relation to a refusal of the Appellant’s FOIA request.
On 2023-July-23 the Tribunal issued case management directions and set the appeal up for final hearing post-April 2024.  The Tribunal directed that this appeal and EA.2023.0051 be heard together.
The stay took effect before the Appellant was due to file his evidence.
Further directions can be issued with a timetable for the evidence.
EA.2023.0251
This FOIA appeal was lodged on 2023-May-10 against the same PA as in 0083.  The directions issued as per 0083.
Cases EA.2023.0083 and EA.2023.0251 are appeals that have been joined already in an earlier Order and can properly be progressed.  Noting the confusion about whether the proceedings would automatically restart after the ending of the stay, those appeals will be reinstated and directions issued separately.
Other applications outstanding which are not part of the application to reinstate -
EA.2023.0057
The application to reinstate does not apply to this case.
On 2023-June-8 the appeal was struck out under Rule 8(3)(c).
The Appellant lodged an application dated 2023-June-12 for a Judge to reconsider the Order of the Registrar dated 2023-June-8 and on 2023-June-27 he submitted an application to certify a contempt against the Registrar/GRC.
These have been addressed in a separate document.
The Appellant is reminded that he remains subject to the case management orders issued for EA.2023.0083 (which includes EA.2023.0251) and FT/EA/2024/0424.
FT/EA/2024/0424 requires urgent action by 2025-January-16 and EA.2023.0083 requires action by the end of January 2025.  A failure to comply with directions may lead to the appeals being struck out.
Any application to review or appeal these orders must be made within 28 days of receipt.

After determination on the papers
THIS JUDGMENT HAS BEEN CIRCULATED TO THE PARTIES VIA EMAIL
MR. JUSTICE TROWER:
This is my ruling on the outstanding matters arising in an application issued on 14 October 2024, by which the Bank seeks an order that Mr Bogolyubov must use all reasonable endeavours to restore 21 companies to the BVI register of companies and provide the Bank with updates as to his progress.  Most of the matters which were in issue until very recently have now been agreed and the parties are agreed that I should decide the remaining points on the papers without a hearing.
As the basis of any order for costs remains in issue, I should explain the background, albeit very shortly.
Mr Bogolyubov has been subject to a worldwide freezing injunction since the commencement of these proceedings in December 2017.  The freezing injunction prevents him from disposing of, dealing with or diminishing the value of any of his assets worldwide and from procuring or permitting non trading companies in which he has an interest from doing the same.
In August 2023, the Bank became aware from its own enquiries that a significant number of BVI companies disclosed by the Defendants during the course of their asset disclosure had been dissolved.  It subsequently became apparent that, of the 36 companies concerned, 35 had been dissolved between May and November 2023.  Of these, 30 are said to hold or have held assets for Mr Bogolyubov.
The consequence of their dissolution is that the assets they hold are bona vacantia and as a matter of BVI law are now vested in the government of the BVI.
The reasons for their dissolution included striking off as a result of the resignation of their registered agent and the non-payment of registry fees.  As is the case in England, BVI law makes provision for applications to restore a dissolved BVI company to the register and when that happens the assets which had vested in the government on dissolution, revest in the company.  The Defendants’ asset disclosure indicates that the assets originally held by the dissolved companies may be worth as much as US$ 1 billion.
Since it discovered the circumstances of the dissolutions, the Bank has been attempting to persuade the Individual Defendants to apply for the dissolved companies’ restoration to the register.  It contends that it has been given a number of representations that steps were being taken by the Defendants or their corporate service providers to seek to do so.  Initially the Defendants contended that they were unable to restore the dissolved companies because they had been unable to find a registered agent in the BVI willing to act for them.  The Bank’s evidence explains in some detail the progress that had been made to obtain registered agents willing to act.  By September 2024 limited progress had been made.
The immediate catalyst for the current application was a letter from Mr Bogolyubov’s solicitors to the Bank’s solicitors on 2024-October-3 disagreeing that he had any obligation to take the steps necessary to seek the restoration of the dissolved companies to the register.  It was also said that, because the registered agents were third parties in which Mr Bogolyubov had no interest and over which he had no control, he was not responsible for the dissolution of the dissolved companies.
The Bank says that this came as a surprise to it and I can understand why.  The correspondence discloses that Mr Bogolyubov had been conducting himself for at least a year in a manner that appeared to accept that he was under an obligation to take reasonable steps both to procure the restoration of the dissolved companies and to provide the Bank with appropriate information in relation to his progress in doing so.  The debate was about the detail of taking that course, rather than the principle of whether he should take that course at all.
It is not said by Mr Bogolyubov that the court has no jurisdiction to grant the relief sought by the Bank.  In an earlier judgment in these proceeding ([2022] EWHC 1445 (Ch)) I considered the applicable principles by reference to JSC Mezprom v Pugachev [2016] 1 WLR 160 and Broad Idea Ltd v Convoy Collateral Limited [2021] UKPC 25.  I can summarise by saying that the question for the court is whether the grant of the relief sought is just and equitable for the purpose of safeguarding the assets which are the subject of the freezing injunction. Is it an ancillary order which it is just and convenient to make in order to render the freezing order itself effective?
In my view that test is satisfied in the present case. There can be no doubt that the dissolution of the relevant companies will have the effect of rendering their assets (or strictly speaking the assets which have now vested in the BVI government as bona vacantia) unavailable for enforcement unless the relevant company is restored to the register.
Furthermore, I think that the Bank has established a good arguable case that Mr Bogolyubov would have been able to prevent their dissolution had he chosen to do so, either by making a relatively small payment of the fees payable to the relevant agent or registry or by taking appropriate steps for the appointment of alternative registered agents.  On the evidence before me on this application, those are still steps that are available to him and which he has not chosen to pursue or has certainly not explained why he has not done so.
In its written skeleton argument for this application the Bank asserted that its attempts to elicit updates from Mr Bogolyubov on his efforts to restore the dissolved companies to the register have been met with stonewalling, delay and indifference culminating with an apparent change of heart.  In my view this description of what occurred is justified and provides some foundation for the Bank’s belief that Mr Bogolyubov is behaving in a manner which is directed at making it more difficult for the Bank to enforce any judgment it may obtain.
In my view, as a matter of principle, it is and always has been just and convenient for Mr Bogolyubov to be ordered to take what steps he reasonably can to have the dissolved companies restored to the register.  It is no longer the case that Mr Bogolyubov contends that as a matter of principle he should not do so. However there remains at least one significant dispute on the detail of the order to be made, other issues having been agreed by Mr Bogolyubov over the course of the past few days.
Amongst the agreed issues is that a company called Myerson United Limited should be included in Schedule 1 to the order as a dissolved company.  Mr Bogolyubov has very recently asserted that Myerson has already been restored, but the Bank has not been able to verify that is the case.  In the event that the Bank is able to verify the position before an agreed order is submitted for my approval, Myerson can be deleted from the Schedule.  In the event that it has not, Myerson should remain in the Schedule
Subject to costs, the continuing dispute relates to the payment of fees.  The Bank seeks an order that:
“For the avoidance of any doubt, the obligation set out in paragraph 1 above includes a requirement that the Second Defendant pay all fees charged by corporate service providers or otherwise necessary to secure restoration of the Dissolved Companies, regardless of the extent of any interest the Second Defendant holds or is said to hold in the Dissolved Companies.”
Mr Bogolyubov says that he should only be required to pay the agency and registry fees commensurate with the extent of his interest in the relevant company.  In practice this means that, where he owns 50% of a company and Mr Kolomoisky owns the other 50%, the taking by him of reasonable steps to restore that company to the register should not include making payment of any more than 50% of the fees.  This obviously means that non-payment by Mr Kolomoisky will result in the relevant company not then being restored to the register, even if Mr Bogolyubov tenders his share.
The Bank makes two separate but inter-related points in answer to this.  First it says that the principle advanced by Mr Bogolyubov is wrong.  Secondly, it accepts that Mr Bogolyubov should only be required to pay 50% if he can demonstrate in advance of the hearing that Mr Kolomoisky has agreed to pay his 50%, as to which there is no evidence that he has.
There is some evidence that on previous occasions Mr Bogolyubov has accepted that he must pay 100% of the registry fees for companies in which he has only a 50% interest.  But in my view the Bank is right on the point of principle in any event.
The starting point is that, as between the Bank and Mr Bogolyubov, the underlying obligation, which is reflected in Mr Bogolyubov’s agreement that he should use all reasonable endeavours to restore the dissolved companies to the register, derives from the freezing order.  By that order both he and Mr Kolomoisky are separately restrained from dealing with the interests they have in particular assets including their respective interests in the companies they hold in common, and the assets which are held by nominee companies on their behalf.  It is inherent in the ownership structures that, if the asset as a whole is lost, each of the separate interests will be lost as well.
It follows that Mr Bogolyubov’s separate responsibility for taking reasonable steps to ensure that his interest in an asset is not extinguished inevitably extends to taking reasonable steps to ensure that the asset as a whole (including therefore interests in the asset to which others such as Mr Kolomoisky may be entitled) is not lost.  As against the Bank, it is not of central relevance that the steps required to ensure that result is achieved will also achieve the same result for the holders of other interests in the same asset.  Certainly, in the current case, the reasonableness of being required to take that course does not depend on whether or not Mr Kolomoisky has also fulfilled (or agreed to fulfil) his obligation to do so.
I should add that, if the relevant company is held 50/50 between Mr Bogolyubov and Mr Kolomoisky, or indeed in any other proportions, the one who incurs expense in preserving their interest (by also preserving the asset as a whole) may have an equitable right of contribution against the other proportionate to the extent of their interest.  But none of this detracts from the fact that as against the Bank reasonable endeavours requires a discharge of the costs in full.  It therefore seems to me that, in the circumstances of this case, reasonable endeavours includes payment in full of the agency and registry related costs of taking the steps necessary to procure restoration of the scheduled companies to the BVI register.
As to the costs of the application, the Bank seeks an order against Mr Bogolyubov on the indemnity basis.  It says that it has had to bring the matter before the court and is plainly the successful party.  The indemnity basis is said to be justified because he has blown hot and cold about whether or not a hearing was required and, having stated that eight weeks were required to put in evidence, has not in the event served any evidence.
Mr Bogolyubov says that it should be costs in the case because Mr Bogolyubov made clear in November that he was willing to take reasonable steps to procure the restoration of all but Brimmilton and that everything which has happened thereafter is unnecessary.
As to which party should bear the costs generally, it is my view that the Bank has been the successful party on an application which it was required to bring, and which has only been resolved in a manner largely favourable to the Bank at the very last minute.  I do not consider that there is any magic in the 26 November date identified by Enyo Law in its latest correspondence because further concessions on points which mattered to the Bank continued to be made thereafter and would not have been achieved if the application had not been maintained.
As to indemnity costs, the question is whether the application is “out of the norm” in a way which justifies such an order (Excelsior Commercial and Industrial Holdings Ltd [2002] EWCA Civ 879 at [31] – [32] and [39]).  The phrase “out of the norm” means “something outside the ordinary and reasonable conduct of proceedings” (Esure Service Ltd v Quarco [2009] EWCA Civ 595 at [25]).
The drawn-out process I have already referred to is not in and of itself a justification for indemnity costs, even though I think that Mr Bogolyubov has made it much more difficult for the Bank to obtain the relief to which it is entitled than should have been the case.
Nonetheless, it does provide the background for an assessment of two aspects of Mr Bogolyubov’s conduct which are out of the norm in the sense established by the authorities and which justify an order for indemnity costs.  Both of them demonstrate unreasonable and potentially prejudicial delaying tactics.  In concluding that this is what they were, I also have regard to the fact that the issues with which the Bank was concerned had been the subject of correspondence for a period of a year before the application was made and that the Bank’s application was only necessitated when Mr Bogolyubov had a change of heart as to the principle of his obligation to ensure that dissolved companies were restored to the register.
The first is the manner in which Mr Bogolyubov has blown hot and cold on whether the matter should be determined on the papers or necessitated a hearing.  He first insisted on a hearing, which caused a delay in the resolution of the issues (with the result that at least one more company was dissolved in the interim) and then changed his mind a few days ago seeking a paper determination on the outstanding issues.  The second was his initial position that he would need eight weeks to put in evidence in response to the application, which was a further cause of what can now be seen to have been unnecessary delay because, when it came to it, no evidence was served.
It seems to me that a summary assessment on the indemnity basis is also appropriate.
The Bank’s statement of costs seeks £81,513, of which £53,548 is solicitors’ costs and £27,965 relates to counsel’s fees.  No challenge is made to counsel’s fees, which were incurred prior to the hearing.  Two issues arses in relation to solicitors’ costs.
The first, which is accepted by the Bank, is that their statement includes £7,692 for attendance at the hearing which was vacated at the last moment.  These costs must therefore be deducted, leaving a claim for solicitors' costs of £45,856.
The second is that Mr Bogolyubov points out that the hourly rates claimed are far in excess of the guideline hourly rates for heavy commercial and corporate work by centrally based London firms.  The charge out rates exceed the 2025 guideline hourly rates by the following percentages: Two Grade A fees earners by c.182% and c.165% respectively, a Grade B fee earner by c.156% and a Grade D fee earner by c.139%.  The percentages will be even higher to the extent that work was carried out in 2024, a factor which is not broken down in the Bank’s statement of costs.
In assessing whether a rate in excess of the guideline hourly rate is appropriate, and if so to what extent, I bear in mind the decision of the CA in Samsung Electronics v LG Display [2022] Costs LR 627 where Males LJ said at [6] that:
“If a rate in excess of the guideline rate is to be charged to the paying party, a clear and compelling justification must be provided. It is not enough to say that the case is a commercial case, or a competition case, or that it has an international element, unless there is something about these factors in the case in question which justifies exceeding the guideline rate.”
I also bear in mind what I know about the complexity of this litigation and what is said in paragraph 29 of the Guide to the Summary Assessment of Costs:
“In substantial and complex litigation an hourly rate in excess of the guideline figures may be appropriate for grade A, B and C fee earners where other factors, for example the value of the litigation, the level of the complexity, the urgency or importance of the matter, as well as any international element, would justify a significantly higher rate. It is important to note (a) that these are only examples and (b) they are not restricted to high level commercial work, but may apply, for example, to large and complex personal injury work. Further, London 1 is defined in Appendix 2 as ‘very heavy commercial and corporate work by centrally based London firms. Within that pool of work there will be degrees of complexity, and this paragraph will still be relevant.”
Taking all of these considerations into account and having regard to the fact that I am conducting a summary assessment on the indemnity basis, I think that some reduction in solicitors’ fees is required.  It is inevitable that this is a relatively broad-brush exercise, but I think that a reduction of £5,000 is required to reflect the fact that the hourly rates are well in excess of the guideline rates, but that para 29 also applies.
Mr Bogolyubov must therefore pay the Bank’s costs of the application summarily assessed in the amount of £68,821. The parties are to agree and submit for my approval an order which reflects both the terms of this ruling, and the points already agreed.

JUDGMENT
Nigel Cooper KC:
Introduction
In this action, the Claimants seek declarations in respect of sums said to be due to them, and for payment of the said sums, under seven Deeds of Indemnity (“the Deeds”) granted by the Defendants. The Defendants deny any liability to the Claimants and also seek declaratory relief by way of counterclaim confirming that they have no such liability. Except where it is necessary to distinguish between the individual Claimants and the individual Defendants, I will refer to the Claimants collectively as NWM and the Defendants collectively as CMIS.
The Deeds were granted by CMIS between May 2006 and April 2008 and were granted in respect of certain amounts that might become payable to NWM under certain swap transactions between NWM and certain securitisation special-purpose vehicles established by CMIS (defined below as the EMAC Issuers).
The dispute between the parties principally turns on the construction of the relevant agreements. I was provided with witness statements from:
Mr. Sachin Arvind Zodgekar and Mr. Jean-Paul Westgate on behalf of NWM.
Mr. Sean Joseph Daly on behalf of CMIS.
None of the above witnesses were called to give evidence orally and none have direct knowledge of the making of the relevant agreements. Indeed, none of them were employed by the party on which behalf they gave evidence at the time when the relevant agreements were made. While their evidence was helpful in explaining the structure and background of the transactions which are at the heart of the present dispute, none of the witnesses could give first-hand evidence as to the reasons for particular features of the transaction structure, such as, for example, the purpose of the Deeds. To the extent that witnesses speculated as to those reasons, I prefer to have regard to the provisions of the relevant agreements, including their recitals, as being the more reliable guide as to the commercial purpose of the agreements. In any event, as CMIS put it in their skeleton argument, there is little to be gained by speculating as to the true commercial purpose of the parties.
Background
The background below is largely taken from the Agreed Common Ground provided by the parties supplemented by the factual accounts set out in the parties’ skeleton arguments as verified by the documents in evidence before me.
Parties
The First Claimant (“NWM NV”) is a company incorporated in the Netherlands. The Second Claimant (“NWM PLC”) is a public limited company incorporated in England. NWM NV and NWM PLC (together “NWM”) are part of an international banking group which provided and provides hedging structures for mortgage-backed securitisations.
The First Defendant (“CMIS NBV”) and the Second Defendant (“CMIS IBV”) (together “CMIS”) are companies incorporated in the Netherlands. CMIS’ primary business is and was the provision of mortgages in the Netherlands (with CMIS NBV being the originator) and Germany (with CMIS IBV being the originator). To give an indication of the scale of the transactions involved, CMIS NBV was the provider of the Dutch mortgages, originating approximately €10 billion of mortgages in the Dutch market from 2000 to 2008.
In 2010, the shares in each of the CMIS parties were sold to an investment fund managed by Fortress Investment Group. Following the sale, CMIS NBV has effectively been in a state of run-off. Its main function is to continue providing the administrative services that it is contractually required to provide in respect of the 22 securitisation structures referred to above. CMIS submits that, as a consequence, it does not have the funds to pay the sums now claimed by NWM and will seek counter-indemnities from the relevant EMAC Issuers (as defined below).
The EMAC Securitisations
CMIS’ mortgage business was funded by the mortgage-backed securitisation market. Between 2006 and 2008, CMIS established a series of securitisation special-purpose vehicles (collectively “the EMAC Issuers”). Each EMAC Issuer entered into an “EMAC Securitisation”, the purpose of which was to purchase mortgage receivables originated by CMIS. The purchase price for these mortgage receivables was funded by the EMAC Issuer issuing rated floating rate notes, (“the Notes”) to investors (“the Noteholders”). This action is concerned with seven of the EMAC Securitisations shown in the table below.
EMAC Issuers
EMAC Securitisations
E-MAC NL 2006-NHG I BV
E-MAC NL 2006-NHG I (“Securitisation 1”)
E-MAC NL 2006-II BV
E-MAC NL 2006-II (“Securitisation 2”)
E-MAC DE 2006-II BV
E-MAC DE 2006-II (“Securitisation 3”)
E-MAC Program BV
E-MAC Program BV (in relation to Compartment NL 2007-I) (“Securitisation 4”)
E-MAC Program II BV
E-MAC Program II BV (in relation to Compartment NL 2007-IV) (“Securitisation 5”)
E-MAC Program III BV
E-MAC Program III BV (in relation to Compartment NL 2008-I) (“Securitisation 6”)
E-MAC Program III BV
E-MAC Program III BV (in relation to Compartment NL 2008-II) (“Securitisation 7”)
Securitisations 1, 2, 4, 5, 6 and 7 relate to Dutch mortgages (“the NL Securitisations”) while Securitisation 3 relates to German mortgages (“the DE Securitisation”).
The mortgage receivables for each Securitisation (“the Mortgage Receivables”) were sold and assigned to the EMAC Issuers by the “Sellers” who were the entities which had originally provided (or otherwise came to have an interest in) the residential mortgage loans to which the Mortgage Receivables related (“the Mortgage Loans”). CMIS was the principal originator. The Mortgage Receivables constituted all rights of the Sellers under the Mortgage Loans including the right to receive the underlying borrowers’ payments of interest and repayments of principal under the Mortgage Loans. As part of the issuance of the Notes, the assets of the EMAC Issuers (principally the Mortgage Receivables) were secured in favour of the Noteholders. Other secured parties included NWM as counterparty to the “Swaps” referred to below.
Pursuant to the terms of the Notes, the EMAC Issuers were obliged to pay floating rate interest at a rate referrable to EURIBOR, to holders of the Notes (“the Noteholders”) on specified quarterly payment dates. The intention was that the EMAC Issuer would use the funds it received from the Mortgage Receivables to make payments of interest and principal under the Notes to the Noteholders. The interest payable under the Notes was referrable to EURIBOR and so could vary with the EURIBOR market rate. By contrast, the Mortgage Loans for each Securitisation were mostly fixed-rate mortgages. The transaction structure created the possibility that, due to a change in interest rates, there could be a cash-flow mismatch between the interest received by the EMAC Issuers pursuant to the Mortgage Receivables and the interest payable by the EMAC Issuers pursuant to the Notes.
This potential exposure was intended to be hedged by the Swaps thereby allowing CMIS to achieve AAA ratings on the Notes. In order to achieve these AAA ratings, the hedging for the Securitisations was structured such that certain payments to NWM under the Swaps were subordinated to the interests of the Noteholders (“the Swap Subordinated Amounts”). In other words, in respect of the Swap Subordinated Amounts, NWM was not very senior in the waterfall of payment priorities in respect of the liabilities of the relevant EMAC Issuer provided for in the security documentation for the Securitisations (“the Payments Waterfall”). It was the risk of non-payment by the EMAC Issuers in certain circumstances which was transferred to CMIS under the Deeds.
The principal documents for each of the Securitisations are described further below.
Prospectuses
For each of the Securitisations, a Prospectus was issued describing the structure, the risk factors, the parties, the securitised assets and the terms and conditions of the Notes:

Trust Deeds and Issuer Trust Agreement
For each of the six NL Securitisations, the security granted by each EMAC Issuer in relation to the Mortgage Receivables was granted to a Security Trustee appointed by a Trust Deed; for Securitisation 3, the equivalent agreement was an Issuer Trust Agreement:

The Trust Deeds (by clause 5.3) and the Issuer Trust Agreement (by clause 9.1) provided for the Payments Waterfall in respect of the liabilities of each EMAC Issuer described above. The Swap Subordinated Amounts to be paid to NWM appear at item (j) in a waterfall, which consists of items (a) to (n).
The Trust Deeds also provided (by clause 4.8) that neither the Security Trustee nor any secured party, which included NWM and CMIS, would institute any form of insolvency proceedings against the EMAC Issuer. This was in effect a non-petition clause intended to ensure the bankruptcy remoteness of the EMAC Issuers.
Master Definitions Agreements and Programme Agreements
For three of the Securitisations, a Master Definitions Agreement was entered into containing the definitions used in the relevant transaction documents:

Issuer Services Agreement
For each of the Securitisations, an Issuer Services Agreement was entered into between the EMAC Issuer, CMIS in its role as (inter alia) “MPT Provider” (mortgage payment transaction provider) and “Issuer Administrator”, the security trustee and NWM as the swap counterparty. Among the tasks of CMIS under the Issuer Services Agreements was to arrange the payment by the EMAC Issuers of payments required by the Payments Waterfall. Those payments would be made from a bank account held with NWM (or their predecessor companies). Pursuant to clauses 23 and 25 of the Issuer Services Agreements, CMIS could in certain circumstances be replaced as MPT Provider or Issuer Administrator including on the occasion of a termination event relating to the insolvency of CMIS. The Issuer Services Agreements are listed below:

EMAC Master Agreements and Swaps

Each EMAC Swap was a “Specified Transaction” under the relevant EMAC Master Agreement and was governed by English law.  The bespoke terms of each Swap were confirmed in a confirmation.
Under the terms of the Swaps, NWM was and is entitled to the Swap Subordinated Amounts (as defined in the Master Definitions Agreements or in the Master Definitions Schedule to the Programme Agreements), which included payments known as (i) “Notional Adjustment Payments” (to the extent that the aggregate amount of such payments exceeded the amount of certain Prepayment Penalties (as defined)); and (ii) “Subordinated Step-Up Amounts” (to the extent that after the First Put Date (as defined) there was an increase in the fixed rate swap in excess of 0.15%). Swap Subordinated Amounts are defined as any Notional Adjustment Payments and Subordinated Step-Up Amounts which are “due but unpaid” by the EMAC Issuer.
Notional Adjustment Payments could arise in circumstances in which the relevant EMAC Issuer adjusted the hedges under the Swaps each quarter to bring them into line with the actual pre-payment rate of the underlying Mortgage Loans and the Notional Adjustment Payments became due from the EMAC Issuer to NWM by way of mark-to-market adjustments (to the extent that the aggregate amount of such payments exceeded the amount of the Prepayment Penalties). Notional Adjustment Payments were Swap Subordinated Amounts and so ranked behind payments to the Noteholders under the Payments Waterfall. The result was that the transaction structure of the Securitisations thereby created a particular credit risk for NWM that, if the pre-payment penalties on the underlying Mortgage Loans were insufficient, then the required Notional Adjustment Payments could go unpaid if the EMAC Issuer lacked the funds to do so.
Subordinated Step-Up Amounts could arise in certain circumstances following the exercise by the Noteholders of ‘put notices’ to redeem the Notes early. NWM had the right under the terms of the Swaps to increase (on notice) the Fixed Rate payable by the EMAC Issuer to ‘reflect [NWM’s] assessment of the commercial risks of entering into a transaction with [the EMAC Issuer] on a Put Date on the same terms as this Transaction’. In that event, only the first 15 basis points of the increase ranked as senior Swap payments under the Payments Waterfall. Any part of the increase which exceeded 15 basis points (known as a “Step-Up Amount”) was a Swap Subordinated Amount and so ranked behind payments to the Noteholders under the Payments Waterfall. The transaction structure of the Securitisations therefore created a particular credit risk for NWM that Subordinated Step-Up Amounts could go unpaid if the EMAC Issuer lacked funds to do so.
For Securitisations 1, 2 and 4 to 7, the Swaps were subject to the following express terms:
Part 5(i) of the Schedule, which provided that
“If [the EMAC Issuer] does not have sufficient funds available to pay, in full and on the due date, an amount to be paid by it under a Transaction: (i) [the EMAC Issuer] will notify [NWM] prior to such due date of the amount of any shortfall; (ii) [the EMAC Issuer] will pay such amount as it is able to pay on such due date; (iii) to the extent that such failure to pay in full and on the due date relates to any Swap Subordinated Amount, such failure to pay shall not constitute an Event of Default for purposes of Section 5(a)(i); (iv) payment of any such shortfall relating to any Swap Subordinated Amount shall be deferred until the first payment date under such Transaction on which [the EMAC Issuer] has sufficient funds available to pay the amount that it would, but for this Part 5(i), have been required to pay on the original due date; (v) interest shall accrue and be payable on any amount so deferred at the rate specified in Section 2(e) and (vi) to the extent that such failure to pay in full and on the due date relates to any amount other than a Swap Subordinated Amount, such failure to pay shall constitute an Event of Default in accordance with Section 5(a)(i) of this Agreement” (“the Payment Deferral Provision”)
Part 5(q)/(s) which provided that:
“Amounts will be paid by [the EMAC Issuer] under this Agreement only if and to the extent that there are funds available for that purpose on the relevant date in accordance with the [Payments Waterfall]” (“the Limited Recourse Provision”).
Securitisation 3 did not contain the Limited Recourse Provision. The Payment Deferral Provision in Securitisation 3 was also in slightly different terms to that found in the other six Securitisations and provided in Part 5(h):
“Other than in respect of Excess Swap Collateral, if [the EMAC Issuer] does not have sufficient funds available to pay, in full and on the due date, an amount to be paid by it under a Transaction: (i) [the EMAC Issuer] will notify [NWM] prior to such due date of the amount of any shortfall; (ii) [the EMAC Issuer] will pay such amount as it is able to pay on such due date; (iii) to the extent that such failure to pay in full and on the due date relates to any Swap Subordinated Amount, such failure to pay shall not constitute an Event of Default for purposes of Section 5(a)(i); (iv) payment of any such shortfall relating to any Swap Subordinated Amount shall be deemed to be due on the next Quarterly Payment Date; (v) interest shall accrue and be payable on any amount so deferred at the rate specified in Section 2(e) and (vi) to the extent that such failure to pay in full and on the due date relates to any amount other than a Swap Subordinated Amount, such failure to pay shall constitute an Event of Default.”
The objective commercial rationale for the Payment Deferral Provisions and the Limited Recourse Provision is a matter of dispute between the parties. However, the parties do agree that the relevant EMAC Issuer can be characterised as (and was intended to be) a bankruptcy remote entity. Further, although there might be a shortfall in the funds available to pay the Notional Adjustment Payments and Subordinated Step-Up Amounts at a particular point in time, further funds might subsequently become available to make those payments.
The Deeds of Indemnity and CMIS Master Agreements
The structure of the Securitisations described so far is a standard structure, with one of the essential purposes of the structure being that the EMAC Issuers as special purpose vehicles can hold their assets, such as the mortgage receivables, separately from CMIS and, therefore, off CMIS’ balance sheet; see Wood, Project Finance, Securitisations, Subordinated Debt, 3rd ed, ch. 6 (esp. at §6-040).
The Deeds are, however, a particular feature of the Securitisation structure established between NWM and CMIS. In essence, in certain circumstances, they transfer the credit risk of a payment shortfall by the EMAC Issuer from NWM to CMIS. NWM and CMIS entered into a Deed in substantially similar terms for each of the Securitisations. The Deeds are governed by English law:

Pursuant to each of the Deeds:
By clause 1.1, “EMAC Indemnifiable Amounts” were defined as:
“In respect of the EMAC Master Agreement: …
Any amount in or towards satisfaction of amounts, if any, due or accrued due but unpaid by the Issuer under the EMAC Master Agreement, other than the Swap Subordinated Amounts;
notwithstanding their inclusion in the definition of “Swap Subordinated Amount’, the aggregate of Notional Adjustment Payments, if any, due but unpaid by the [EMAC] Issuer under the EMAC Master Agreement but only to the extent such aggregate amount exceeds the Prepayment Penalties;
notwithstanding their inclusion in the definition of “Swap Subordinated Amounts”, payments due after the First Put Date from the [EMAC] Issuer to [NWM] corresponding to that portion, if any, of the increase in the Fixed Rate (as defined in the EMAC Master Agreement) to be paid by the [EMAC] Issuer that is in excess of 0.15 per cent …[the Subordinated Step-Up Amounts]”.
By clause 2.1, the Deeds provided that:
“[CMIS] covenants with [NWM] that, subject to the following provisions of this deed:
it will on demand pay to [NWM] an amount equal to any EMAC Indemnifiable Amounts as from the date such EMAC Indemnifiable Amounts are due under the EMAC Master Agreement …;
…
it will be a primary obligor for any EMAC Indemnifiable Amounts to the extent these are not recovered from the Issuer, provided that [CMIS] will have the same benefits, protections and defences at law that are available to the [EMAC] Issuer”.
By clause 2.2, CMIS and NWM agreed “for the benefit of the [EMAC] Issuer that any payments by [CMIS] of EMAC Indemnifiable Amounts pursuant to this Deed will discharge the [EMAC] Issuer’s obligation to pay corresponding amounts under the EMAC Master Agreement”.
By clause 6(a) of each Deed, it was agreed that “the agreement set out in this deed shall be a Transaction under the [CMIS Master Agreement] for which this deed is a Confirmation”.
Pursuant to each of the CMIS Master Agreements, it was agreed:
By Section 2(e), that a party that defaults in the performance of any payment obligation would be required to pay interest (before as well as after judgment) on the overdue amount to the other party on demand in the same currency as such overdue amount, for the period from (and including) the original due date for payment to (but excluding) the date of actual payment, at the Default Rate, such interest to be calculated on a daily compounding basis.
By Section 14, that the Default Rate was to be a “a rate per annum equal to the cost (without proof or evidence of any actual cost) to the relevant payee (as certified by it) if it were to fund or of funding the relevant amount plus 1% per annum”.
By Section 5(a)(i), that an Event of Default would be constituted by the occurrence at any time with respect to a party of a failure by that party to make when due, any payment under the CMIS Master Agreement required to be made by it if such failure is not remedied on or before the third Local Business Day (as defined) after such notice is given to the party.
By Section 6(a), that, if at any time an Event of Default with respect to a party had occurred and was continuing, the other party was entitled, by not more than 20 days’ notice to the defaulting party specifying the relevant Event of Default, to designate a day not earlier than the day such notice was effective as an Early Termination Date in respect of all outstanding Transactions.
CMIS’s failure to pay under the Deeds
On a quarterly basis since the entry into force of the Securitisations to date, CMIS (acting in its capacity as Issuer Administrator for each of the Securitisations as distinct from its capacity as the indemnifying party under the Deeds or any other capacity) has agreed with NWM the quantum of Notional Adjustment Payments and Subordinated Step-Up Amounts for the relevant quarter, including the quantum of what are referred to below as the “Relevant Amounts” (being the quantum of Notional Adjustment Payments and Step-Up Amounts from 25 January 2017 onwards).
In the period up to January 2017, if and when the EMAC Issuers were unable to pay subordinated Notional Adjustment Payments and/or Subordinated Step-Up Amounts due under the terms of the Swaps to NWM because they had insufficient funds, CMIS paid such sums to NWM under the terms of the relevant Deeds.
However, from 25 January 2017 onwards (in the case of Securitisations 1, 2, 4, 5, 6 and 7) and from 27 February 2017 onwards (in the case of Securitisation 3) CMIS has continued to agree to the quantum of these sums on a quarterly basis but, as and when the EMAC Issuers have failed to pay subordinated Notional Adjustment Payments and/or Subordinated Step-Up Amounts due under the terms of the Swaps to NWM, CMIS has refused to pay such sums to NWM.
By letters dated 3 February 2017 and 5 April 2017, CMIS contended that upon proper construction of the Deeds, it was not liable to pay any such sum.
The cessation of payments by CMIS pursuant to the Deeds coincided with a significant increase in the quantum of the subordinated Notional Adjustment Payments in respect of the Securitisations (from c. £1.8 million in 2016 to c. £93 million in 2017). There is a dispute between the parties as to whether this increase is the true explanation for CMIS’s change of position and refusal to pay.
NWM has demanded from CMIS immediate payment of the outstanding sums due to be paid under each of the Deeds, including by way of various letters dated 4 October 2022. NWM again demanded payment of these sums from CMIS in a Letter of Claim dated 25 November 2022. CMIS has not paid the sums demanded or any part thereof and maintains that it has no obligation to do so.
The sums originally demanded by NWM and claimed by CMIS included Subordinated Step-Up Amounts in respect of Securitisations 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 7. However, NWM have discontinued their claims for these sums such that the sums sought by NWM consist almost entirely of Notional Adjustment Payments. The remaining sum sought in respect of Subordinated Step-Up Amounts for Securitisation 6 is less than €135,000.
The Issues
NWM contends that the sums it seeks to recover from CMIS (“the Relevant Amounts”) are “EMAC Indemnifiable Amounts” under the Deeds which cannot be recovered from the EMAC Issuers and that CMIS is liable to pay those sums to NWM under the Deeds.
CMIS contends that:
The Deeds are guarantees rather than true indemnities and should therefore be construed in accordance with a rule of law known as the ‘co-extensiveness principle’.
The Payment Deferral Provisions provide for the deferment of payment of any shortfall by the EMAC Issuer until the first payment date on which that Issuer has sufficient funds available to pay (or in the case of Securitisation 3 until the next quarter payment date when funds are available).
The Limited Recourse Provision is included in materially identical form in the Schedule to the EMAC Master Agreement for each Securitisation (except Securitisation 3).
If any payment obligation of an EMAC Issuer in respect of a Swap is deferred pursuant to the relevant Payment Deferral Provision, then the relevant amount is not due or payable by the EMAC Issuer until such time as the payment obligation ceases to be deferred (being the first payment date under the relevant Transaction on which the EMAC Issuer has sufficient funds available to pay).
It follows that, for as long as any Notional Adjustment Payment or Subordinated Step-Up Amount is deferred pursuant to the relevant Payment Deferral Provision, the Relevant Amount does not constitute an “EMAC Indemnifiable Amount” as defined in the corresponding Deed, and CMIS has no obligation to indemnify NWM in respect of such amount until such time as the payment obligation ceases to be deferred.
Further or alternatively, the Payment Deferral Provision and/or the Limited Recourse Provision constitute a benefit, protection or defence at law that is available to the EMAC Issuer within clause 2.1(iv) of the Deed, and CMIS is accordingly entitled to rely on those provisions against NWM (as if CMIS itself were the EMAC Issuer) by way of defence to any claim for an indemnity under the Deed.
In relation to both their arguments as to the effect of the Payment Deferral Provision and the Limited Recourse Provision, CMIS make their case on the basis of what they say is the proper construction of the EMAC Master Agreements and the Deeds read together and on the basis of the application of the co-extensiveness principle. They did not seek at the hearing to rely on any argument which required as a necessary constituent the manipulation of the language of the Deeds so as to extend to CMIS a protection that was otherwise only available to the EMAC Issuers.
In response, NWM submits that CMIS’ contentions are not sustainable on a proper construction of the Deeds and the EMAC Master Agreements. They are, NWM says, also contrary to business common sense.  In particular, NWM says, the construction contended for in respect of clause 2.1(iv) of the Deeds would render the Deeds devoid of any, or any substantial, commercial purpose. CMIS in reply say that the purpose of the Deeds was connected to CMIS’ role as Issuer Administrator.
NWM originally submitted that the core of the issues remaining between the parties can be distilled as follows:
Are the Relevant Amounts “due” under the EMAC Master Agreements, such that they constitute EMAC Indemnifiable Amounts under the Deeds?
Is CMIS entitled to rely on the Payment Deferral Provision and/or the Limited Recourse Provision by virtue of clause 2.1(iv) of the Deeds?
To these two issues, they added the question of whether the Deeds are to be characterised as contracts of guarantee to which the co-extensiveness principle applies.
CMIS distils the issue even further and says that the sole issue that falls to be determined in the proceedings is whether NWM can recover the Swap Subordinated Amounts from CMIS notwithstanding that those amounts are subject to a payment deferral so far as the EMAC Issuers are concerned.
Relevant Legal Principles
So far as construing the Deeds and other securitisation documents together is concerned, the effect of the judgments of Lord Clarke in Rainy Sky v Kookmin Bank [2011] 1 WLR 2900 at [14], [21]–[28] and of Lord Hodge in Wood v Capita Insurance Services Ltd [2017] AC 1173 at [8]–[14] can be summarised as follows:
The court’s task is to ascertain the objective meaning of the language used by the parties. The Court must consider what a reasonable person, that is a person who has all the background knowledge which would reasonably have been available to the parties in the situation in which they were at the time of the contract, would have understood the parties to have meant.
The exercise is a unitary one in which the Court must consider the language used, the relevant surrounding circumstances and the commercial consequences of rival constructions (Re Sigma Finance Corp [2009] UKSC 2 at [12]).
An overly literal interpretation of a provision without regard to the whole scheme may distort or frustrate the commercial purpose. Of great importance for the ascertainment of the relevant meaning, therefore, is an understanding of the overall scheme and a reading of the relevant term which places it in the context of the overall scheme (Re Sigma Finance at [12] and [35]-[37]).
Where there are two available constructions, the Court is entitled to prefer the construction that is consistent with business common sense and to reject the other, or to prefer the construction that produces the more commercial result.
For the purposes of the issues which I have to decide, each party inevitably contended that their construction of the agreements was the one which fitted the parties’ commercial purpose and was consistent with business common sense. The difficulty in the present case is the lack of relevant contemporaneous evidence as to either the parties’ commercial intentions or the factors which determine objectively what accords with business common-sense. I have drawn inferences where I sensibly can but this is a case where the language used and understanding the scheme of the Securitisation structure overall is of great importance to the proper construction of the Deeds.
So far as the question of whether a contract is a contract of guarantee or a contract of indemnity is concerned, the parties were agreed that the decision in Vossloh Aktiengesellschaft v Alpha Trains (UK) Ltd [2011] 2 All ER (Comm) 307 provides a useful summary of the principles:
A contract of suretyship may contain a range of obligations, falling into two broad categories - guarantee and indemnity obligations; at [19] – [34].
Whether a particular contract is of one kind or the other, or indeed a combination of the two, turns on the construction of the words used; at [20] and [27].
In this respect, suretyship is an area of law bedevilled by imprecise terminology, where it is important not to confuse the label used by the parties with the substance of the obligation. Labels may or may not be indicative of what the parties intended; at [20].
The parties’ own use of the terms ‘guarantee’ or ‘indemnity’ is not conclusive but it will be indicative; at [20].
The substance of an obligation is to be identified in accordance with normal principles of construction, and by looking at the instrument as a whole without any preconceptions as to the nature of the obligation; at [20].
The essential characteristics of an indemnity obligation is that it is not a secondary obligation (as characterised above) but imposes a primary payment obligation on the giver of the indemnity; at [25] – [26].
A contract of guarantee, in the true sense, is a contract whereby the guarantor promises the creditor to be responsible for the due performance by the principal debtor of his existing or future obligations to the creditor if the principal debtor fails to perform them or any of them. This does not mean that the guarantor’s liability can only sound in damages; it can also sound in debt; at [23].
One essential distinguishing feature of a true contract of guarantee is that the liability of the guarantor is always ancillary, or secondary, to that of the principal debtor, who remains liable to the creditor. There is no liability on the guarantor unless and until the principal debtor has failed to perform his obligation. In accordance with the principle of co-extensiveness, the guarantor is generally only liable to the same extent that the principal is liable to the creditor; at [24].
A contract which contains a provision preserving liability in circumstances where a guarantor would otherwise be discharged will usually indicate that the contract is one of guarantee, because such a provision would be unnecessary if the contract were one of indemnity. On the other hand, a provision stating that the surety is to be liable in circumstances where the principal has ceased to be liable may be indicative either of a guarantee (because the provision would be unnecessary in the case of a contract of indemnity) or of an indemnity (because it makes clear that the liability of the surety was intended to be independent of the principal’s liability); at [27].
I accept that all the principles set out in the previous paragraph guide the task of construing CMIS’ obligations under the Deeds.
It is correctly accepted by CMIS that the principle of co-extensiveness does not apply to a contract of indemnity; see Vossloh at [26].
So far as the principle of co-extensiveness is concerned, CMIS referred me to a passage from Andrews and Millett, The Law of Guarantees (7th edition) at paragraph 6-002, which explains the principle in the following terms:
“The most important aspect of the nature of a guarantor’s liability as a secondary liability is that it is co-extensive with the liability of the principal. This means that as a general rule, the surety’s liability is no greater and no less than that of the principal, in terms of amount, time for payment and the conditions under which the principal is liable. Accordingly, in Hartland Public Officer of the Gloucestershire Banking Company v Jukes (Executors and Executrix of William Steward Deceased) (1863) 1 Hurl. & N. 667, where the principal and surety both gave a promissory note to the creditor as security for advances, no action could be maintained on the note against either principal or surety until an advance was made to the principal by the creditor. Co-extensiveness of liability is one of the essential characteristics of a guarantee that distinguishes it from a contract of indemnity …
However, the principle of co-extensiveness is not an immutable rule. The precise extent of the liability of the surety will always be governed by the provisions of the guarantee on their true construction, and the parties remain free in certain respects to provide for limitations of the surety’s liability without detracting from the nature of the contract as a guarantee. Furthermore, the court has not always regarded itself as bound to treat the surety as co-extensively liable with the principal, and there are circumstances where the surety will remain liable notwithstanding the fact that the principal is not, or is no longer, liable for the principal obligation.”
Two matters stand out from the above passage.
The principle of co-extensiveness is not a strict rule. Even in relation to a contract of guarantee, its application will still be subject to the provisions of the contract in question and its effect will be dependent on the true construction of those provisions.
Even under a contract of guarantee to which the principle of co-extensiveness applies, there may be circumstances where the surety remains liable notwithstanding that the principal is released from its obligations to the creditor. Whether this is the case will depend on the true construction of the terms of the contract said to be a contract of guarantee.
Commercial Context and the parties’ intentions
Both parties made submissions to me as to the commercial context relevant to the construction of the Deeds and to determining the parties’ intentions. Those submissions are relevant not only to the specific questions of construction I have to decide but also to the wider question of the nature of the Deeds. For that reason, I address the question of commercial context separately to my conclusions on each of the principal issues. However, I do not overlook the fact that the process of construction is a unitary exercise dependent both on the relevant commercial context and the language of the contracts.
CMIS submits that the Deeds are curious documents, which were executed behind the scenes between NWM and CMIS. They contend that it is unusual for an originator of a securitisation to provide a guarantee or indemnity in favour of the swap counterparty because the whole point of a securitisation is to remove assets and liabilities from the originator’s balance sheet. They submit that if the Deeds are construed as entitling NWM to the indemnity they seek, this would run contrary to the purpose of a securitisation by restoring a liability for the EMAC Indemnifiable Amounts to CMIS balance sheets.
CMIS also points to the fact that the drafting of the Deeds is bespoke and is not a standard form document promulgated by the Loan Markets Association or similar organisation or in the standard form of guarantee as required by a bank. They highlight that the Deed is not a one-sided document but confers benefits on both parties. They also suggest that the origins of the Deeds are shrouded in obscurity to a far greater extent than a normal bank guarantee or indemnity.
These submissions were made in support of CMIS’ submission that the purpose of the Deeds should be narrowly construed and limited to ensuring the fulfilment by CMIS of its role as Issuer Administrator to pay over to NWM the sums to which it was entitled under the Payments Waterfall.
CMIS further submitted that the Deed does not include any form of non-compete provision, by which they mean a provision that the guarantor agrees not to assert its right of counter-indemnity against the principal debtor until such time as the guaranteed sums have been paid in full to the creditor. CMIS says that such a broadly drafted non-compete provision is commonplace in virtually all modern guarantees but not present in the Deeds. They submit that this means that CMIS is free to enforce counter-indemnity claims against the relevant EMAC Issuer as soon as they pay any amount to NWM and that is precisely what CMIS intends to do if the Court enters judgment for NWM.
This submission was made on the basis that the risk of counter-indemnity claims would have been known to the parties at the time that the Deeds were made and would be something the parties would want to avoid given that their intention was that the EMAC Issuers were to be bankruptcy remote. CMIS go further and submit that if the Deeds are to be construed as permitting NWM to recover the EMAC Indemnifiable Amounts from CMIS, this would raise questions as to whether NWM fairly presented the risks associated with the Securitisations to the Noteholders.
As to the risk of counter-indemnity claims by CMIS against the EMAC Issuers, both parties explored in some detail the legal issues which potentially arise. NWM submitted that such claims were not possible or at least were very unlikely to succeed whereas CMIS submitted that they had very strong claims to a right of counter-indemnity.
In the end, this is not an issue which I can or should decide at this stage beyond accepting that while there may be significant commercial or legal hurdles to any counter-indemnity claims by CMIS, they are at least arguable.
Nevertheless, it seems to me that there is no good evidence that the risk of counter-indemnity claims was or should reasonably have been in the mind of both CMIS and NWM when the Deeds were being negotiated. Likewise, I do not consider that the fact that the Deeds are uncommon documents to find in a securitisation structure and are bespoke is a reason to conclude that the documents were not intended to impose potentially significant liabilities on CMIS. Rather, it seems to me at least equally arguable that the facts that the agreements are unusual and were in a bespoke form point to the documents being intended to ensure that if the EMAC Issuers failed to pay EMAC Indemnifiable Amounts to NWM, then NWM were entitled to recover those sums from CMIS even if the reason for the Issuers’ failure to pay was that the Issuers did not have the funds to make the required payments.
Similarly, I do not accept that the fact that the scale of the payments now demanded by NWM from CMIS is such as it may lead to CMIS becoming insolvent is a material factor which I can properly take into account when construing the Deed. There is no evidence that the risk of such significant exposures was in the mind of either party at the time the Deeds were concluded. Further, notwithstanding the amount of the sums, which NWM now seeks to recover, it cannot be said that the possibility that CMIS owes NWM such a significant sum is such a commercially absurd result that the court should conclude that this is not what the parties intended. As both parties accepted, whichever party is right as to the construction of the Deeds, one of them was inevitably accepting the credit risk that the EMAC Issuers would not be able to pay the EMAC Indemnifiable Amounts.
I do consider it relevant that both parties were experienced in securitisation structures of the type in issue and both advised by law firms very experienced in drafting the documents required for such structures. Those advisers would be well aware of the difference between contracts of guarantee and contracts of indemnity as well as the potential impact of language suggesting possible primary obligations on CMIS. In this regard, I consider that there is considerable force in the argument made by NWM that if the Deeds were intended to have the limited effect suggested by CMIS, then the Deeds would have been drafted in substantially different form.
In his witness evidence, Mr. Daly referred to evidence given by Mr. Willems, the former Chief Investment Officer of Credit Management & Investor Solutions B.V. (“CMIS Group”), to the court in Amsterdam, the Netherlands as to the circumstances in which NWM released a parent company guarantee previously given by General Motors in respect of certain liabilities of CMIS NBV under an ISDA Master Agreement which CMIS NBV had signed with NWM NV. Mr. Willems’ evidence to the court in Amsterdam was to the effect that he believed that the Deeds provided little security for NWM’s exposure to the EMAC Issuers. I did not find this evidence helpful in circumstances where I have no good evidence of the issues in the Dutch proceedings and Mr. Willems’ view as to the effect of the Deeds reflected only his opinion. I further note that during the period of Mr. Willems’ employment with CMIS Group, CMIS was indemnifying NWM for sums not recovered from the EMAC Issuers where there was a shortfall in the sums received by the EMAC Issuers preventing them making the payments to NWM.
Are the Deeds to be construed as contracts of guarantee and, if so, what is the consequence?
CMIS submits that the Deeds are to be construed as contracts of guarantees based on two key factors.
First, CMIS says, the Deeds are expressly drafted on the footing that NWM will only be entitled to demand payment from CMIS as from the dates when the EMAC Indemnifiable Amounts are due under the EMAC Master Agreement. The EMAC Indemnifiable Amounts are in turn defined as amounts that are ‘unpaid’ by the Issuer. This arrangement CMIS says is consistent with a contract which is a contract of guarantee.
Second, CMIS says, the express language of clause 2.1(iv) provides decisive support for the conclusion that the Deeds are to be characterised as a guarantee because:
The opening words of the clause are consistent with a contract of guarantee because CMIS’ obligation to pay the EMAC Indemnifiable Amounts is parasitic on the Issuer’s failure to perform its own obligations.
The proviso at the end of clause 2.1(iv) is an express incorporation of the co-extensiveness principle. CMIS goes on to say that this proviso was obviously inserted at the behest of CMIS when the contract was being drafted but there is no evidence to establish whether this is correct or not.
A conventional principal debtor clause would not be sufficient to impose a true primary obligation on CMIS. But in case there was any doubt, the drafters inserted the proviso at the end of clause 2.1(iv).
The points made in the previous paragraph are supplemented by the following relevant considerations:
In support of their arguments, CMIS submits that NWM did not provide any coherent meaning for the words ‘benefits, protections and defences at law’ found at the end of clause 2.1(iv). CMIS says that this phrase is a broad one intended to ensure that, if the EMAC Issuer was not obliged to pay NWM, then nor was CMIS.
CMIS further submits that if the parties are minded to exclude any one or more of the normal principles in the law of guarantees, then this can only be done using clear and unambiguous language. This, it is said, is effectively a rule of strict construction which survives the modern approach to contractual construction.
While I am not persuaded that it is correct to describe the requirement for clear and unambiguous language as a rule of strict construction, I accept that in general courts should still require evidence of clear intention from words used in a contract of guarantee to justify the nature and extent of the liability undertaken by a surety.
In response, NWM relied on the following matters to establish that the Deeds are not contracts of guarantee or at least not contracts to which the co-effectiveness principle applies.
The Deeds are entitled ‘Deeds of Indemnity’. While this is not conclusive, it is indicative, especially when the contracts were drafted, as these were, by skilled lawyers.
The Deeds use the language of indemnity not the language of guarantee. The verb ‘guarantee’ and the noun ‘guarantor’ do not appear anywhere. In contrast, the verb ‘indemnify’ and the phrase ‘EMAC Indemnifiable Amounts’ are used throughout.
The verb ‘indemnify’ appears twice in Recital 3(ii) and clause 10 of the Deeds and in both contexts can only refer to sums for which the EMAC Issuers cannot ever be liable. In other words, in both places, the verb is being used in its technical sense of establishing a primary liability and not as a synonym for the verb ‘guarantee’.
In respect of the term ‘EMAC Indemnifiable Amounts’, that term is defined at clause 1.1 of the Deeds to cover 4 different types of payment sums set out at letters (a) to (d); of which at least one, the ‘EMAC Mark to Market Value’, represents a sum for which the EMAC Issuers could never be liable because it is a sum payable by NWM to the EMAC Issuer. Again, therefore, the words ‘EMAC Indemnifiable Amounts’ are being used in a technical sense to refer to sums to be indemnified by way of a primary payment obligation.
Each of the payment obligations found in clauses 2.1(i) to (iii) are properly categorised as primary payment obligations. In particular, the obligation in clause 2.1(i) requires payment on demand of any EMAC Indemnifiable Amounts from the date they are due under the EMAC Master Agreement, which is a badge of a primary obligation.
In light of the above, the covenant in the first half of clause 2.1(iv) that CMIS will be a primary obligor for any EMAC Indemnifiable Amounts makes sense and the words should be given effect in accordance with their terms. What the words are doing is reflecting and reinforcing that the payments required under clause 2.1(iv) are primary obligations in the same way that the obligations in clause 2.1(i) to (iii) are.
It would be wrong to construe the second half of clause 2.1(iv) as a derogation from the first half and as emptying that payment requirement of any meaning, which is what CMIS’s argument that the second half is the embodiment of the co-extensiveness principle would do.
Further, the payment obligations created by clause 2.1(i) are simply not in the nature of secondary obligations.
Clauses 4(a) and (b) make explicit that CMIS’ liability is not co-extensive with the liability of the EMAC Issuers or indeed of any other ‘person liable in respect of any of the EMAC Indemnifiable Amounts or interested therein’.
Standing back from the detail, the essential nature of a secondary obligation is that the guarantor can have no liability unless the principal debtor has an obligation which it has failed to perform. The essential nature of a primary obligation is that it is not a secondary obligation.
If what the parties had really intended was secondary liability as regards the Notional Adjustment Payments and the Subordinated Step-Up Amounts such that CMIS could not be liable to pay unless and until the EMAC Issuer had the funds available in accordance with the Payment Waterfalls but had defaulted in payment then in the real world, the Deeds would have been drafted in completely different way. In particular, the payment obligation in respect of the Notional Adjustment Payments and the Subordinated Step-Up Amounts would have been drafted: either (i) as a see-to-it guarantee in respect of the EMAC Issuer’s payment obligations; or (ii) as an obligation conditional upon on-going payment default by the EMAC Issuer.
The question of the proper characterisation of the Deeds cannot be divorced from that of their commercial purpose.
In particular, if CMIS were right to characterise the Deeds as contracts of guarantee and right to assert that the co-extensiveness principle applies, their approach produces the surprising and uncommercial result that the Deeds would respond as regards Notional Adjustment Payments and Subordinated Step-Up Amounts in circumstances where the EMAC Issuers had the funds available to pay NWM the Notional Adjustment Payments and Subordinated Step-Up Amounts, but would not respond in any other set of circumstances.  In short, the Deeds would respond as regards the Notional Adjustment Payments and Subordinated Step Up Amounts in circumstances where they were entirely unnecessary, and they would never respond in circumstances where they were needed.
The suggestion that the purpose of the Deeds was to encourage CMIS (as the Issuer Administrator) to perform its obligations under the Issuer Services Agreement and distribute funds to NWM when available is commercially unreal. NWM had other routes available by which it could ensure the distribution of funds when they were available.
CMIS’ approach to characterisation involves a result which does not offer any credible explanation for why the Notional Adjustment Payments and Subordinated Step-Up Amounts  were included within the definition of EMAC Indemnifiable Amounts at all.
In support of the arguments set out in the previous sub-paragraph, NWM rely on the following passage in Re Sigma Finance Corp [2009] UKSC 2:
“of much greater importance ...in the ascertainment of the meaning that the deed would convey to a reasonable person with the relevant background knowledge, is an understanding of its overall scheme and a reading of its individual sentences and phrases which places them in the context of that overall scheme” [12]
None of the in terrorem consequences, which CMIS suggests would follow if the Deeds are construed as contracts of indemnity should be given any weight in the exercise of characterisation.
In the first place, the risk that a CMIS insolvency might pose for its role as Issuer Administrator and as MPT Provider is not a risk inimical to the transaction structure.  On the contrary, it was a risk expressly contemplated by the transaction documentation.
In the second place, the risk of CMIS having an unfettered right of counter-indemnity against the EMAC Issuers which might result in insolvency proceedings against the EMAC Issuers can also be disregarded in the exercise of characterisation because there is no basis for a finding that any such unfettered right exists under English or any other law.
Largely for the reasons given by NWM, I consider that they are correct that the Deeds are contracts of indemnity as opposed to being contracts of guarantee.
Stepping back and looking at the Deeds and Securitisation documentation generally, the documents and the structure they create are complex and carefully drafted to work together. As noted in paragraph ‎66 above, the documents were obviously drafted by skilled legal professionals for parties, which were highly experienced in the securitisation structures. If the intention of those parties and their advisers was to draft a deed of indemnity which was in reality a contract of guarantee or to ensure that CMIS were to have no greater liability in respect of the EMAC Indemnifiable Amounts than the EMAC Issuers, then I consider that the contract would have been drafted in very different terms and would not have been titled ‘Deed of Indemnity’. In particular, when one looks at the covenants in clause 2.1 and sees that each of sub-clauses (i) to (iii) is in ‘on demand’ terms and such that they are only properly characterised as being obligations of indemnity, then it seems to me to follow that by imposing an obligation on CMIS as primary obligor in sub-clause (iv) the parties were intending that CMIS should accept an obligation to indemnify NWM in the technical sense. This conclusion is reinforced by the link between the obligation on CMIS to pay EMAC Indemnifiable Amounts that are due on demand under clause 2.1(i) and the acceptance of a role as primary obligor for EMAC Indemnifiable Amounts which are not recovered from the EMAC Issuer under clause 2.1(iv).
Although the words ‘to the extent these are not recovered from the Issuer’ in clause 2.1(iv) are arguably consistent with the only obligation on CMIS being a secondary obligation arising only after the EMAC Issuer has failed to pay, I do not consider that this is the intention of the words here. Rather, I accept Mr. Davies-Jones KC’s submissions that the words are intended only as a statement of fact as to the sums for which CMIS is to be a primary obligor and which are payable on demand. This it seems to me is the construction of the first half of clause 2.1(iv) which is consistent with the nature of the obligations assumed under clause 2.1 and with the Deeds taken as a whole; see the approach in Vossloh at [45].
This conclusion is not undermined by the second half of sub-clause (iv) for reasons set out in paragraphs ‎78 and ‎79 below. Nor is it undermined by the fact that parties do sometimes describe a party as being a primary obligor even in circumstances where the contract looked at as a whole is a contract of guarantee. Looking at the Deeds, I accept that when the term ‘primary obligor’ is used in clause 2.1(iv), it is intended to create a primary obligation in the sense that this term is used in a contract of indemnity rather than being consistent with a contract of guarantee imposing only secondary obligations.
I have already stated that I accept that if the Deed was to have the limited purpose suggested by CMIS, then it would have been drafted in different terms. There is nothing in the language of the Deeds which points to the purpose of clauses 2.1(i) and (iv) being only to ensure that CMIS complied with its responsibilities as Issuer Administrator for distributing the EMAC Issuer’s assets in accordance with the Payments Waterfall rather than imposing primary payment obligations on CMIS.
Further, I accept that the fact that the document is titled ‘Deed of Indemnity’ and uses the language of indemnity rather than that of guarantee is of significance in the context of the Deeds. As already set out above, these agreements were drafted by skilled professionals, who would have understood the significance of the language they were using. Accordingly, while neither the title nor the language of the Deeds is necessarily conclusive as to the nature of the agreements, this is a case where the choice of title and of language does carry significant weight in determining the nature of the contract.
So far as the second half of clause 2.1(iv), is concerned, I accept NWM’s submission that it cannot be construed in a way which deprives CMIS’ express acceptance of a responsibility as primary obligor of any effect. If one were to construe the phrase ‘[CMIS] will have the same benefits, protections and defences at law that are available to the Issuer’ as extending to CMIS the entitlement to rely on the Payment Deferral Provision or the Limited Recourse Provision then this would contradict the notion that CMIS was to be a primary obligor for the amounts that could not be recovered from the EMAC Issuer. I also consider that if the intention of the parties were to provide CMIS with such entitlement, then the clause would say so expressly rather than using the opaque language of the existing clause. In this regard, I accept NWM’s submissions that:
The words ‘at law’ qualify not only the word ‘defences’ but also the words ‘benefits’ and ‘protections’, a conclusion which is reinforced by comparison with the language of clause 4(c) of the Deed of Indemnity and section 9(d) of the CMIS ISDA Master Agreement 1992.
The intention of the phrase is to ensure that where the EMAC Issuer has no liability for a payment because there has been an event which gives it a right at law to refuse payment, for example, a frustrating event or where for any other reason the EMAC Issuer’s payment obligation was void as a matter of law, CMIS would be entitled to rely on that event or reason as well.
I do agree with CMIS that the provisions of clauses 4(a) and (b) of the Deeds are more consistent with provisions which might be found in a contract of guarantee rather than a contract of indemnity. But, while I do not consider that the sub-clauses advance NWM’s case that the Deeds are contracts of indemnity, nor do I consider that they materially undermine NWM’s case. The presence of those provisions is explicable as a piece of belt-and-braces drafting; see Shanghai Shipyard Co. Ltd v Reignwood Intl Investment (Group) Co. Ltd [2021] 1 WLR 5408 at [38].
Finally, I turn to deal with CMIS’ arguments on the consequences of a finding that the Deeds are contracts of indemnity rather than guarantee.
As to this, I accept that the risk of a CMIS insolvency for its role as Issuer Administrator and MPT Provider is not a risk which was inimical to the transaction structure. On the contrary, as already stated above, it was a risk expressly contemplated by the transaction documentation such that in the event of such an insolvency, the Issuer Services Agreements provided for the termination of its roles as Issuer Administrator and as MPT Provider and for the appointment of substitute providers; see for example clause 25 of the Issuer Services Agreement for Securitisation 1.
CMIS also says in relation to this issue that in the event that they are found to be liable for the EMAC Indemnifiable Amounts, they will seek a counter-indemnity from the EMAC Issuers with the consequence that those Issuers will be forced into insolvency. I have explained in paragraphs ‎60 to ‎66 above, why I do not consider that this risk affects the proper construction of clause 2.1 of the Deeds.
For all the above reasons, I consider that the Deeds are contracts of indemnity as opposed to contracts of guarantee and the co-extensiveness principle does not apply for the purposes of construing their provisions, particularly clauses 2.1(i) and 2.1(iv).
Are the Relevant Amounts “due” under the EMAC Master Agreements (and therefore under the Deeds)?
The material terms in respect of Securitisations 1, 2, 4, 5, 6 and 7 are set out above at paragraphs ‎22 to ‎29.
By way of recap pursuant to clause 2.1(i) of the Deeds: CMIS covenanted that, subject to the terms of the Deeds, it would on demand pay to NWM an amount equal to any EMAC Indemnifiable Amounts as from the date such EMAC Indemnifiable Amounts were due under the EMAC Master Agreement.
CMIS submitted that in circumstances where the EMAC Issuers were entitled to rely on the Payment Deferral Provisions in the Securitisations to defer their payment obligation in relation to EMAC Indemnifiable Amounts, there could be no payment due for the purposes of clause 2.1(i) of the Deeds.
The Payment Deferral Provision is found at part 5(i) of the Schedule to the EMAC ISDA Master Agreement for those Securitisations. By way of reminder it provides that:
“If [the EMAC Issuer] does not have sufficient funds available to pay, in full and on the due date, an amount to be paid by it under a Transaction: (i) [the EMAC Issuer] will notify [NWM] prior to such due date of the amount of any shortfall; (ii) [the EMAC Issuer] will pay such amount as it is able to pay on such due date; (iii) to the extent that such failure to pay in full and on the due date relates to any Swap Subordinated Amount, such failure to pay shall not constitute an Event of Default for purposes of Section 5(a)(i); (iv) payment of any such shortfall relating to any Swap Subordinated Amount shall be deferred until the first payment date under such Transaction on which [the EMAC Issuer] has sufficient funds available to pay the amount that it would, but for this Part 5(i), have been required to pay on the original due date; (v) interest shall accrue and be payable on any amount so deferred at the rate specified in Section 2(e); and (vi) to the extent that such failure to pay in full and on the due date relates to any amount other than a Swap Subordinated Amount, such failure to pay shall constitute an Event of Default”
For Securitisation 3:
Clause 2.1(i) of the Deed contains a materially identical provision to that found in the Deeds for the other Securitisations, save that it refers to a “written demand”, which NWM says, and I find, was made in NWM’s letter to CMIS of 4 October 2022.
The Payment Deferral Provision is found in Part 5(h) of the Schedule to the EMAC Master Agreement. By way of reminder, it provides:
“Other than in respect of Excess Swap Collateral, if [the EMAC Issuer] does not have sufficient funds available to pay, in full and on the due date, an amount to be paid by it under a Transaction: (i) [the EMAC Issuer] will notify [NWM] prior to such due date of the amount of any shortfall; (ii) [the EMAC Issuer] will pay such amount as it is able to pay on such due date; (iii) to the extent that such failure to pay in full and on the due date relates to any Swap Subordinated Amount, such failure to pay shall not constitute an Event of Default for purposes of Section 5(a)(i); (iv) payment of any such shortfall relating to any Swap Subordinated Amount shall be deemed to be due on the next Quarterly Payment Date; (v) interest shall accrue and be payable on any amount so deferred at the rate specified in Section 2(e) and (vi) to the extent that such failure to pay in full and on the due date relates to any amount other than a Swap Subordinated Amount, such failure to pay shall constitute an Event of Default.”
Turning first to Securitisation 3 and NWM’s argument that it permitted only one deferral of any payments otherwise due, the Payment Deferral Provision in respect of Securitisation 3 permits deferral until the “next Quarterly Payment Date”. The Quarterly Payment Dates are the 25th day of February, May, August and November. NWM says that on its proper construction the provision does not on its terms defer CMIS’s payment obligation until an unspecified future date when the EMAC Issuer has sufficient funds to pay rather it permits one postponement until the next Quarterly Payment Date (which has now passed for all sums outstanding under Securitisation 3). In contrast, CMIS submits that while the language of Securitisation 3 is different, the effect is identical to that for the other securitisations. If the EMAC Issuer does not have any sufficient funds to pay a Swap Subordinated Amount on any Quarterly Payment Date, then the due date is repeatedly deferred to the next Quarterly Payment Date until such time as the Issuer has sufficient funds available to pay the sum in question.
On the language of Securitisation 3, both interpretations of its provisions are possible. But, on balance, I am persuaded that CMIS’ interpretation of clause 5(h) is to be preferred.  The language of the clause permits an interpretation which allows for a repeated deferral of payment of sums outstanding in respect of a Swap Subordinated Amount until such time as the Issuer had sufficient funds available to pay the sums in question. Further, no good explanation is available as to why the scheme for Securitisation 3 should be different to that for the other securitisations. Securitisation 3 relates to the German mortgage lending unlike the other Securitisations but this does not in itself provide any explanation for why a different approach is to be taken for payment deferrals under that Securitisation in contrast to the scheme for the Dutch mortgage lending.
I therefore turn to consider the position in relation to the other six Securitisations.
CMIS’ case was succinctly summarised at paragraph 61 of their Skeleton Argument, namely:
Clause 2.1(i) of the Deed of Indemnity is the only provision under which NWM can demand payment from CMIS. Even if a deferred sum can be treated as an “EMAC Identifiable Amount”, this does not mean that a demand for payment of that sum can be made under clause 2.1(i).
A demand can only be made under clause 2.1(i) as from the date such EMAC Indemnifiable Amounts are due under the EMAC Master Agreement.
In this context, the word ‘due’ is expressly tied to the contractual due date under the ISDA Master Agreement which necessarily changes whenever a payment is deferred.
There is a well-recognised distinction in English law between the date on which a debt accrues (i.e., is due) and the date upon which a debt is payable. Although the two dates may often coincide, they are conceptually distinct. The courts have recognised that the drafting of the ISDA Master Agreement reflects this distinction. So, for example, in Videocon Global Ltd v Goldman Sachs International [2016] EWCA Civ 130, it was held in respect of the drafting of Section 6 of the ISDA Master Agreement at [53]:
“The first important point to note is that, as in many contracts, there is a clear distinction in the Master Agreement between, on the one hand, the underlying indebtedness obligation and the date on which such obligation accrues, (i.e. the date at which the relevant amount becomes due) and, on the other hand, the payment obligation and the date upon which the obligation to pay the relevant amount arises. Although the language of section 6 might be said to be somewhat inconsistent, on occasions, between its use of words ‘due’ on the one hand and ‘payable’ on the other, nonetheless the distinction between the debt obligation and the payment obligation and the different dates upon which those obligations respectively arise, is clear in the scheme of the contract. That distinction is particularly clear, for example, in the definition of payment date in section 6(d)(ii).
In the context of section 2 of the ISDA 1992 Master Agreement, the Court of Appeal in Lomas & Ors. v. JFB Firth Rixson Inc [2012] 2 All ER (Comm) 1076 also considered the nature of the obligations imposed by that section. The court made the following findings:
“[25] Section 2 of the master agreement is, however, all about the payment obligation and does not, in our view, touch the underlying indebtedness obligation. In particular, section 2(a)(i) obliges each party to make each payment specified in the confirmation and it is that payment obligation which is, by section 2(a)(iii), made subject to the condition precedent that no event of default has occurred and is continuing.
…
[28] A similar argument to that advanced by Mr. Fisher was submitted to Gloster J. by Mr. Jonathan Crow QC in Pioneer Freight Futures Co. Ltd (in liq) v. TMT Asia Ltd [2011] EWHC 778 (Comm) … a case about FFAs decided after the decision of Briggs J in the present case, at any rate in his oral reply (see [72]). It was rejected by her for much the same reasons as we have set out. She said (at [91])
“Once one approaches the analysis on the basis that, under section 2(a)(iii), one is only looking at the payment obligation, rather than the debt obligation, the whole machinery makes sense. Thus the wording of section 2(a)(iii) makes it clear that the payment obligation is subject to the condition precedent that no Event of Default or Potential Event of Default has occurred “and is continuing”. The natural reading of those words envisages that once a condition precedent is fulfilled, the obligation to pay revives. There is no need for any further creation of the debt obligation itself, as Mr. Crow seeks to suggest.’
We would respectfully adopt those observations of Gloster J and hold that the underlying debt obligation is undisturbed by the event of default; it is merely the payment obligation which is barred if there is an event of default. We turn therefore to the next question, which is whether the obligation to pay is extinguished or is merely suspended so that it can and will revive if the event of default is cured before termination by either party or on the maturity of the transaction.
Likewise in Deutsche Bank AG v Sebastian Holdings Inc. [2024] 3 WLR 135, a case concerning the proper construction of s.24(2) of the Limitation Act 1980, Popplewell LJ said at [13] – [14]:
“I start with the ordinary meaning of the word “due”, without resort to context. Each side submitted that its natural meaning favoured the construction for which it contended. Mr McLeod submitted that its natural meaning was payable. Mr Morris submitted that its natural meaning was owing (which is the expression I shall use to mean an amount in respect of which a liability has arisen notwithstanding that it may be payable at a future time).
I would reject both submissions. As a matter of language, devoid of context, “due” may mean owing or payable. If a lease provides for rent to accrue from day to day but to be payable monthly in arrears, one might equally say that the rent falls due daily or that it falls due at the end of the month. Either is a natural use of language.
Others have expressed the same view. In Ex p Kemp, In re Fastnedge (1874) LR 9 Ch App 383, Mellish LJ said at p 387:
“Now, the words ‘debts due to him’ are certainly words which are capable of a wide or a narrow construction. I think that prima facie, and if there be nothing in the context to give them a different construction, they would include all sums certain which any person is legally liable to pay, whether such sums had become actually payable or not. On the other hand, there can be no doubt that the word ‘due’ is constantly used in the sense of ‘payable’ …”
In In re Stockton Malleable Iron Co (1875) 2 Ch D 101 Sir George Jessel MR said at p 103:
“On the seventh article the argument addressed to me was this. It was said ‘moneys due’ included moneys owing, but not at present payable. To that I answer, adopting the criticism of Mellish LJ in Ex p Kemp on the words of the Bankruptcy Act, that the word ‘due’ may mean either owing or payable, and what it means is determined by the context.””
What both the Videocon case and the Deutsche Bank case emphasise is that the word ‘due’ can refer to the accrual of a debt or the fact that the debt is payable or both. The word may be used interchangeably in different contexts within the same agreement and even within the same provision of the agreement. Further, the decision in Lomas confirms that where a payment obligation is suspended or deferred this does not disturb the underlying debt obligation. It follows that it is necessary to look to the language of the relevant agreements to determine when the word ‘due’ is being used to refer only to a party’s payment obligation or when it is being used to refer either only to the accrual of party’s obligation in debt or to both that obligation and the obligation of payment.
Turning first to the language of the EMAC Master Agreements:
The language of Part 5(i) of the Schedule to the relevant EMAC Master Agreements makes clear that payments were only capable of being deferred by the EMAC Issuer thereunder once the “due date” had been reached.
There is no express language in Part 5(i) of the Schedule to suggest that the accrual of a debt, as opposed to its payment, is being deferred. Had it been intended to defer the accrual of the debt, then I consider that one would expect the clause to say so expressly.
Not only is there no express language to produce that result, but the focus of Part 5(i) is on the payment of the relevant debt obligations, rather than their accrual. Throughout Part 5(i), the language of deferring payment only is used. In particular, the start of sub-paragraph (iv) of Part 5(i) makes clear that the subject of the deferral provision is “payment” rather than anything else.
Mr. Smith KC and Mr. Davies-Jones KC both submitted in their oral submissions that references to ‘due date’ in the first, second and fourth lines of Part 5(i) is a reference to the due date for payment. However, Mr. Davies-Jones KC also submitted that the intention of the clause was not to modify the accrual of the underlying debt, which was also due. Mr. Smith KC accepted in his oral submissions that this was correct and Part 5(i) was only concerned with deferral of the EMAC Issuer’s payment obligations.
The language of sub-paragraph (iii) of Part 5(i) – “such failure to pay in full… on the due date” – also supports the idea that the relevant debt must be due, since there could be no “failure” if no debt had accrued by that date.
Further sub-paragraph (iii) refers to Swap Subordinated Amounts. The definition of Swap Subordinated Amounts found in the Master Definitions Agreement uses ‘due’ in sub-paragraph (i)(a) and (b) to refer to amounts which have accrued due. In particular, so far as Notional Adjustment Payments are concerned, they are Swap Subordinated Amounts to the extent that they are ‘due’ but ‘unpaid’
Further, pursuant to sub-paragraph (v) of Part 5(i), interest is payable on the payment deferred at the Default Rate specified in Section 2(e) of the relevant EMAC Master Agreements. The very fact that interest is payable assumes the relevant debt is due in the sense of owing; interest would not be accruing if there was no present debt; that is to say if the debt had not accrued due. This conclusion is supported by the particular rate at which interest accrues on the deferred payment - viz the Default Rate. If, by operation of Part 5(i), the debt is not due, in the sense of accrued, there would be no rationale for applying the Default Rate. The very notion of “default” establishes once again that a debt has become due and is outstanding, albeit that payment is being deferred.
The above interpretation of clause 5(i) means that there can be a consistent interpretation across clause 5(i) and clause 5(h) in the EMAC Master Agreement for Securitisation 3 because both clauses are concerned with the deferral of a payment obligation rather than deferral of the accrued debt.
In circumstances where the language of clause 5(i) postpones the payment date of EMAC Indemnifiable Amounts but does not affect the accrual of the debt obligation or the fact that such amounts are owing, the next question is whether for the purposes of clause 2.1(i) of the Deeds, the use of the word ‘due’ in that sub-clause refers to sums which are due in the sense of being payable or whether it is referring to sums which are due in the sense of being owing.
I find that in the context of clause 2(1)(i), the word ‘due’ is being used to refer to sums which are accrued due so that there is an existing obligation in debt irrespective of whether payment has been deferred.
I consider that this construction for clause 2.1(i) is consistent with the purpose of the Deeds as discussed in the section on commercial context at paragraph ‎56 and following above.
It is consistent with the definition of Swap Subordinated Amount in the Master Definitions Agreement.
It is consistent with the definition of EMAC Indemnifiable Amounts found in clause 1.1 of the Deeds, which defines those amounts:
Generally as ‘any amount in or towards satisfaction of amounts if any, due or accrued due but unpaid by the Issuer under the EMAC Master Agreement’.
In relation to Notional Adjustment Payments, as being the aggregate of such payments due but unpaid by the Issuer under the EMAC Master Agreement to the extent that such aggregate amount exceeds the Prepayment Penalties.
In relation to increases in the Fixed Rate to be paid by the Issuer that are in excess of 0.15 per cent, such payments that are due after the First Put Date.
It is further consistent with the description of the purpose of the Deeds found in Recital (3)(ii) namely to indemnify NWM in relation to amounts owing to NWM in relation to the hedging agreements, which would include the EMAC Master Agreements and the Schedules thereto.
CMIS submitted that its construction, the effect of which is that CMIS cannot be liable to indemnify NWM under the Deeds at a time when the relevant EMAC Issuer benefits from a deferral of its obligation to pay, is the “plain effect” of the language used by the parties. But, for the reasons outlined in paragraphs ‎84 to ‎99 above, I do not accept this submission. Further, I consider that to construe clause 2.1(1) in the manner submitted by CMIS would be inconsistent with my conclusion that the Deeds are properly to be construed as contracts of indemnity imposing primary obligations on CMIS.
CMIS also submitted that its construction is consistent with the objective commercial purpose of the structure. CMIS relied on, inter alia, the evidence of Mr Daly for the proposition that the liability in respect of the Relevant Amounts could be substantial and contends that it would not have made commercial sense for it to expose itself to a risk of a very large claim that it might have had insufficient funds to pay. CMIS argues that such a scenario gave rise to a risk of it entering insolvency proceedings, as a result of which it might be unable to carry out its obligations as Issuer Administrator and its obligations as original lender to German and Dutch mortgagors. It was said by CMIS that the mortgagors may then make claims against it which would deplete the pool of assets available to the Noteholders.  CMIS’s submission was that the parties to the Deeds could not have intended CMIS to become insolvent during the life of the transactions.
For the reasons set out in the section on commercial context at paragraph ‎56 and following above, I do not accept these submissions.  The Securitisation documentation as a whole demonstrates that the risk that CMIS could become insolvent was a risk that the Noteholders were exposed to generally and it was something expressly contemplated by some of the Securitisation documentation. In particular, the Issuer Services Agreements expressly provided for termination of the appointment of CMIS as Issuer Administrator and the appointment of a substitute in the event that CMIS became insolvent and was unable to perform as Issuer Administrator (clause 25 of each Issuer Services Agreement). Further, the fact that CMIS agreed to arrangements which with the benefit of hindsight have exposed it to the risk of a large claim is not a reason to prefer CMIS’s construction; it is possible that one side may have agreed to something which with hindsight did not serve its interest (Wood v Capita Insurance).
I find that the purpose of the Deeds (objectively established) was to protect NWM in the event that the relevant EMAC Issuer failed to make payment to NWM of (inter alia) Swap Subordinated Amounts when such payment fell due under the Swaps. CMIS accepted the risk that it might be called upon to make payments under the Deeds in circumstances where the EMAC Issuers had insufficient funds to pay. The interpretation contended for by NWM is consistent with the objective commercial purpose of the structure.
In summary, the Relevant Amounts are “due” under the EMAC Master Agreements for the purposes of clause 2.1(i) of the Deeds and, therefore, are to be paid by CMIS to NWM under the Deeds.
Is CMIS entitled to rely on the Payment Deferral Provision and/or the Limited Recourse Provision by virtue of clause 2.1(iv) of the Deeds?
This question only arises in circumstances where I have found that the Relevant Amounts are under the terms of the Deeds EMAC Indemnifiable Amounts which are due under the EMAC Master Agreement.
As set out above, pursuant to the Payment Deferral Provisions (and, save in respect of Securitisation 3, the Limited Recourse Provision), the EMAC Issuers are entitled to defer payment of the sums which make up the EMAC Indemnifiable Amounts in the event that they do not have the funds available to make the payments. CMIS claims to have the same right of deferral pursuant to the co-extensiveness principle which they say is given contractual effect by the second half of clause 2.1(iv). This is the only route by which CMIS sought to rely on the Payment Deferral Provisions (and Limited Recourse Provision).  CMIS abandoned any argument that they could rely on clause 2.1(iv) in any event by manipulating the language of the Payment Deferral Provisions.
In circumstances where I have held above that the Deeds are contracts of indemnity to which the co-extensiveness principle does not apply and where I have found that the language of clause 2.1(iv) is not apt to allow CMIS the protection of the Payment Deferral Provisions, it follows that the answer to this question must be ‘no’.
Quantum
The amounts claimed pursuant to the Deeds, and in respect of each Securitisation, are set out in Schedules 4A to 4E and 5A and 5B to the Re-Amended Particulars of Claim. They are:
€41,458,759 in respect of Securitisation 1 (due to NWM NV);
€30,932,183 in respect of Securitisation 2 (due to NWM NV);
€2,805,953 in respect of Securitisation 3 (due to NWM PLC);
€29,132,463 in respect of Securitisation 4 (due to NWM NV);
€35,563,138 in respect of Securitisation 5 (due to NWM PLC);
€10,437,629 in respect of Securitisation 6 (due to NWM NV);
€4,923,803 in respect of Securitisation 7 (due to NWM NV).
CMIS has not disputed the quantum of the amounts claimed by NWM. Indeed, notwithstanding their failure to pay the sums demanded pursuant to the Deeds, they have continued, in their capacity as Issuer Administrator, to agree the amounts due in respect of the Swaps. Further evidence as to the process by which the amounts were compiled is found in the first witness statement of Mr. Zodgekar. That evidence was not challenged.
Conclusion
For all the above reasons, I find that NWM’s claims succeed as shown in paragraph ‎108 above. It follows that CMIS’ counterclaim fails.
NWM also seeks further declaratory relief in respect of CMIS’ liability for those amounts. In this regard, I will leave the parties to agree so far as possible the terms of any declarations still required in light of the judgment above.
I would further ask the parties to liaise as to an appropriate final order dealing with any other matters arising from this judgment. To the extent that the terms of such an order cannot be agreed, then I will deal with any outstanding matters at a hearing to deal with consequential matters including costs and any application for permission to appeal, if any.
I am very grateful to counsel and their instructing solicitors for all their work in the preparation and presentation of their respective cases.

to the parties or their representatives by e-mail and by release to the National Archives.
Lord Justice Holroyde, Lord Justice Stuart-Smith and Lord Justice Jeremy Baker:
In March 2015, Ms Esengul Woodcock was attacked and seriously injured by her former partner Riza Guzelyurt.  She brought proceedings against the Chief Constable of Northamptonshire Police, alleging that the police owed her a duty of care to protect her from an attack, and were in breach of that duty.  Her claim was dismissed by HH Judge Murdoch.  Ms Woodcock brought a successful appeal before Ritchie J.  By permission of William Davis LJ, the Chief Constable now appeals against the decision of Ritchie J.
In March 2016, a man to whom we shall refer as MP was sentenced to a total of 10 years’ imprisonment for two offences of rape of children, 13 offences of sexual assault on a child under 13, and 25 offences of making or possessing indecent images of children.  The five victims of his sexual offences are entitled to anonymity.  We shall refer to them individually by the letters CJ, PJ, HD, PD and OB, and collectively as “CJ and others” or “the appellants”.  They brought proceedings against the Chief Constable of Wiltshire Constabulary, alleging that the police owed each of them a duty of care to protect them against MP, and were in breach of that duty.  They claimed damages for negligence or compensation for breach of their rights under articles 3 and 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights.  Each of their claims was dismissed by Martin Spencer J.  By permission of William Davis LJ, they now appeal against that decision.
Thus both actions raise issues as to whether the police may be liable in damages for failing to protect a person from harm caused by the criminal actions of a third party.  For that reason the appeals, though otherwise unconnected, were heard together.
This is the judgment of the court in relation to both appeals.
Case law prior to the hearings below
Shortly before the appeals were heard, the Supreme Court handed down judgment in Tindall v Chief Constable of Thames Valley Police [2024] UKSC 33 (“Tindall SC”).  That judgment had not, of course, been available to the judges below.  It is convenient, before coming to the facts and arguments in the individual cases, to summarise the case law which was considered below.  We shall return to Tindall SC later in this judgment.
In Van Colle v Chief Constable of Hertfordshire Police, Smith v Chief Constable of Sussex Police [2008] UKHL 50, [2009] 1AC 225 (“Van Colle and Smith”) the House of Lords allowed appeals by the defendant Chief Constables in two cases.  The first involved a claim that the police had failed to act compatibly with article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights (“the Convention”).  In the second case, the claimant had reported to the police that he had been repeatedly threatened by his former partner.  The threats had included threats to kill him.  The claimant was later attacked and severely injured by this former partner.  He brought proceedings alleging that the police had negligently failed to protect him from that attack.
In relation to that second case, their Lordships stated the “core principle” that the police owed no common law duty to protect individuals from harm caused by criminals.  There was no exception to that principle which would impose a duty of care in circumstances such as had occurred in the instant case, where the police were discharging their general public law duty of law enforcement.
In Michael v Chief Constable of South Wales Police [2015] UKSC 2, [2015] AC 1732 (“Michael”) the police had failed to give sufficient priority to an emergency telephone call made by a woman who reported that her former partner had threatened to kill her.  They responded immediately to a later call by the victim, but were too late to prevent her being stabbed to death.  The estate and dependants of the deceased claimed damages for negligence.  Summary judgment was given in favour of the Chief Constable.  That decision was upheld by the Supreme Court.  Lord Toulson, giving the leading judgment of the majority of their Lordships, stated at [97] the general rule that liability in negligence is not imposed for pure omissions:
“It is one thing to require a person who embarks on an action which may harm others to exercise care.  It is another matter to hold a person liable in damages for failing to prevent harm caused by someone else.”
Lord Toulson then identified two well-established exceptions to that general rule, the second of which was a case in which a public authority had assumed a positive responsibility to safeguard an individual.
Lord Toulson later explained, at [114] and [115]:
It does not follow from the setting up of a protective system from public resources that if it fails to achieve its purpose, through organisational defects or fault on the part of an individual, the public at large should bear the additional burden of compensating a victim for harm caused by the actions of a third party for whose behaviour the state is not responsible.  To impose such a burden would be contrary to the ordinary principles of the common law.
The refusal of the courts to impose a private law duty on the police to exercise reasonable care to safeguard victims or potential victims of crime except in cases where there has been a representation and reliance, does not involve giving special treatment to the police.  It is consistent with the way in which the common law has been applied to other authorities vested with powers or duties as a matter of public law for the protection of the public. …”
At [138], Lord Toulson rejected as untenable a submission on behalf of the claimant that what had been said to her by the call handler who took her 999 call was sufficient to give rise to an assumption of responsibility:
“The only assurance which the call handler gave to Ms Michael was that she would pass on the call to the South Wales Police.  She gave no promise how quickly they would respond.  She told Ms Michael that they would want to call her back and asked her to keep her phone free, but this did not amount to advising or instructing her to remain in her house, as was suggested.  Ms Michael’s call was made on her mobile phone.  Nor did the call handler’s inquiry whether Ms Michael could lock the house amount to advising or instructing her to remain there.”
In Robinson v West Yorkshire Police [2018] UKSC 4, [2018] AC 736 (“Robinson”) a pedestrian had been knocked to the ground and injured as police officers attempted to arrest a man in the street.  The Supreme Court, reversing the decisions of the trial judge and of this court, held that it was reasonably foreseeable that pedestrians who were close by would be injured in the course of the arrest, that the police were under a duty of care towards those pedestrians, and that the officers who were attempting to make the arrest were in breach of that duty.
At [21], Lord Reed (with whom Baroness Hale and Lord Hodge agreed) rejected a submission that the decision in Caparo Industries Ltd v Dickman [1990] 2 AC 605 (“Caparo”) established a test applicable to all claims in negligence, so that the courts would only impose a duty of care where it was considered fair, just and reasonable to do so.  Rather, the correct approach was based on precedent and on developing the law incrementally and by analogy with established authorities. Lord Reed noted, at [26], that there are many situations in which it has been clearly established that a duty of care is or is not owed.  He continued:
“Where the existence or non-existence of a duty of care has been established, a consideration of justice and reasonableness forms part of the basis on which the law has arrived at the relevant principles.  It is therefore unnecessary and inappropriate to reconsider whether the existence of the duty is fair, just and reasonable (subject to the possibility that this court may be invited to depart from an established line of authority).  Nor, a fortiori, can justice and reasonableness constitute a basis for discarding established principles and deciding each case according to what the court may regard as its broader merits.  Such an approach would be a recipe for inconsistency and uncertainty …”
Lord Reed added, at [27], that it would normally only be in a novel type of case, where established principles did not provide an answer, that the court would need to go beyond those principles to decide whether a duty of care should be recognised.
At [34], Lord Reed stated the rule that public authorities, like private individuals, are generally under no duty of care to prevent the occurrence of harm.  He referred with approval to the summary of the “omissions principle” given in an academic article by Tofaris and Steel, “Negligence liability for omissions and the police” (2016) 75 CLJ 128 (“Tofaris and Steel”):
“In the tort of negligence, a person A is not under a duty to take care to prevent harm occurring to person B through a source of danger not created by A unless (i) A has assumed a responsibility to protect B from that danger, (ii) A has done something which prevents another from protecting B from that danger, (iii) A has a special level of control over that source of danger, or (iv) A’s status creates an obligation to protect B from that danger.”
Lord Reed went on, at [37], to state the further general rule that public authorities, like private individuals, owe no duty of care towards individuals to prevent them from being harmed by the conduct of a third party.  He noted that exceptions to that general rule included –
“… circumstances where the public authority has created a danger of harm which would not otherwise have existed, or has assumed a responsibility for an individual’s safety on which the individual has relied.”
The proceedings in Tindall v Chief Constable of Thames Valley Police [2022] EWCA Civ 25, [2022] 4 WLR 104 (“Tindall CA”) arose out of a fatal road traffic accident which occurred when a driver lost control of his car on a patch of black ice.  There had been an earlier, less serious, accident when a Mr Kendall had lost control of his car on the same patch of ice.  Mr Kendall had reported the ice to the police and had tried to signal to other drivers to slow down or stop.  Police officers attended, spoke to Mr Kendall and put up a warning sign.  However, they subsequently left the scene, taking the sign with them.  The fatal accident occurred a few minutes later.
The claimant Mrs Tindall brought proceedings, as widow and executrix of the estate of the deceased, alleging that the Chief Constable was liable in negligence for her husband’s death.  The Chief Constable applied to strike out the claim as disclosing no reasonable cause of action, or alternatively for summary judgment. The application was refused by a Master, but this court allowed an appeal by the Chief Constable.
Stuart-Smith LJ, with whom Nicola Davies LJ and Thirlwall LJ agreed, summarised at [54] the principles to be applied when deciding whether the police have assumed responsibility towards individual members of the public so as to come under a duty to exercise reasonable care to protect them from harm.  Omitting references to earlier cases, he stated:
Where a statutory authority (including the police) is entrusted with a mere power it cannot generally be made liable for any damage sustained to a member of the public by reason of a failure to exercise that power.  In general the duty of a statutory authority is to avoid causing damage, not to prevent future damage due to causes for which they were not responsible …
It follows that a public authority will not generally be held liable where it has intervened but has done so ineffectually so that it has failed to confer a benefit that would have resulted if it had acted competently …
Principle (ii) applies even where it may be said that the public authority’s intervention involves it taking control of operations …
Knowledge of a danger which the public authority has power to address is not sufficient to give rise to a duty of care to address it effectually or to prevent harm arising from that danger …
Mere arrival of a public authority upon, or presence at, a scene of potential danger is not sufficient to found a duty of care even if members of the public have an expectation that the public authority will intervene to tackle the potential danger …
The fact that a public authority has intervened in the past in a manner that would confer a benefit on members of the public is not of itself sufficient to give rise to a duty to act again in the same way (or at all) …
In cases involving the police the courts have consistently drawn the distinction between merely acting ineffectually … and making matters worse …
The circumstances in which the police will be held to have assumed responsibility to an individual member of the public to protect them from harm are limited.  It is not sufficient that the police are specifically alerted and respond to the risk of damage to identified property … or injury to members of the public at large … or to an individual …
In determining whether a public authority owes a private law duty to an individual, it is material to ask whether the relationship between the authority and the individual is any different from the relationship between the authority and other members of the same class as the individual …”
Stuart-Smith LJ concluded, at [73], that there was no basis on which the police could be found to have assumed responsibility towards Mr Tindall or other road users.  He continued, at [74] –
“What occurred was a transient and ineffectual response by officers in the exercise of a power.  It did not involve any assumption of responsibility to other road users in general or to Mr Tindall in particular for the prevention of harm caused by a danger for the existence of which the police were not responsible.”
The claimant appealed to the Supreme Court: see paragraph 84 below.
We turn to a summary of the essential facts of each of the cases, the proceedings below, and the grounds of appeal.
Ms Woodcock’s case: the facts
For about two years from 2013, Ms Woodcock was in an “on/off” relationship with Guzelyurt.  During that period, each had made complaints to the police about the other, but had subsequently resumed the relationship.  Ms Woodcock’s complaints had included reports that Guzelyurt had threatened to kill her.  Guzelyurt had been given a number of harassment warnings by the police.  He had also been convicted of an offence of assault on Ms Woodcock’s former husband.
Ms Woodcock ended the relationship on 4 February 2015.  She reported to the police that Guzelyurt had threatened her and her children.
On 5 February 2015 Guzelyurt went to Ms Woodcock’s place of work.  He was ejected.  Ms Woodcock later found that the wing mirrors of her car had been damaged.
On 6 February Guzelyurt was arrested for criminal damage and harassment, and was bailed subject to conditions which included prohibitions against contacting Ms Woodcock or going to her home or work addresses.
On 27 February Ms Woodcock reported that Guzelyurt had entered her car and asked her to drop the charges.  It was noted that she was “crying and very shaken” when making this report.
On 17 March 2015 she reported that he had approached her, tried to hug and kiss her and followed her to her car.
On 18 March she reported that he had followed her, held her car door, and threatened to kill everyone in her household if he was sent to prison.  Later that afternoon she returned to her home to find evidence of an attempted entry.  A CCTV camera had recorded Guzelyurt jumping over Ms Woodcock’s fence.
Police officers attended Ms Woodcock’s home that night and took a witness statement from her.   A short time after the officers had left, Ms Woodcock reported that Guzelyurt had kicked her front door, thrown himself at it and threatened to kill her.  The police again went to her house.   Guzelyurt had departed, but Ms Woodcock’s former husband was present, having been asked by Ms Woodcock’s daughter to come to the house for protection.
Ms Woodcock was advised to lock all doors and windows; to keep her mobile phone fully charged; to go into a locked room and call the police on 999 if  Guzelyurt came to the house; to have family or friends stay with her overnight; and to make her neighbours aware of the situation.  She asked for a police officer to remain outside her house, and an officer was present for much of the time until about 3am.
Police officers made considerable efforts overnight to trace and arrest Guzelyurt, but could not find him.  At 7am on 19 March 2015 Sergeant Randall came on duty and put in place a plan to arrest Guzelyurt when he went to work at 8am.
At 7.32am a female neighbour rang 999 and said that Guzelyurt was loitering outside Ms Woodcock’s house and “I think he’s going to attack her when she comes out to go to work.  … She’s going to go to work about 7.45”.  The neighbour described Guzelyurt as “lurking on the corner” and “pacing up and down with his arms behind his back”, and added:
“I’ve tried contacting her but she’s changed her mobile number so there’s no way of me, unless I go over, I don’t really want to get involved.”
At the conclusion of that call, the call handler said to the neighbour:
“Okay, I’m going to get the officers to go straight round, we need to obviously stop anything taking place and I’ll have a look and see what we know about them as well, okay?”
The call was treated as an emergency, and an officer was at once sent to arrest Guzelyurt.  Sgt Randall also went immediately to Ms Woodcock’s house. No call was made by the police to Ms Woodcock to tell her of the neighbour’s information or to tell her that an officer was attending.
Ms Woodcock left the house with her children and her former husband.   Guzelyurt attacked her as she was about to get into her car.  He stabbed Ms Woodcock repeatedly, causing severe injuries.
Sgt Randall arrived on the scene at 7.46am, one minute after Ms Woodcock’s daughter had made a 999 call to report that Guzelyurt was attacking her mother with a knife.
Guzelyurt was subsequently convicted of attempted murder and sentenced to life imprisonment.
Ms Woodcock’s case: the proceedings below
Ms Woodcock claimed damages for negligence. In essence, her claim was based on the failure of the police to protect her from attack, to arrest Guzelyurt earlier than they did, or to warn her that Guzelyurt was outside her house.
Judge Murdoch dismissed the claim.  He found that the Chief Constable did not hold or assume a duty of care to Ms Woodcock.  If he was wrong about that, he held that none of the alleged breaches of duty had been proved.  In particular, in relation to the criticism that Sgt Randall had failed to ring Ms Woodcock to inform her of the neighbour’s warning, Judge Murdoch found:
“PS Randall acted in a timely manner; he deployed to this job as soon as it came in, he raced to the claimant’s address arriving within minutes.  He could do no more.  He used his judgement, the perpetrator was outside her home, no one knew he was armed with a knife.  I heard most of the police witnesses say that the most effective method to reduce risk is to remove its source and to arrest the perpetrator would achieve that aim.  PS Randall knew the perpetrator was outside her home, he knew where he was and could now be arrested.  He wanted to get there as soon as he could to effect that plan.  I find PS Randall acted as many officers would have done and bears no responsibility for the events that sadly unfolded.”
Judge Murdoch also found that it was not within the training or guidance of those who handled the 999 call to ring and warn a potential victim.
Judge Murdoch further found that the claimant had established no causative link between the pleaded breaches of duty and Guzelyurt’s attack:
“In essence her case is that if the police had acted differently he would have been arrested earlier or she would have acted differently, by residing elsewhere that night or not leaving the house.  The claimant advanced no evidence that if she had been aware that he was outside she would not have left the house.”
Judge Murdoch, though sympathetic to the personal plight of Ms Woodcock, therefore dismissed her claim.
On appeal to the High Court, Ritchie J identified the main issue as being whether the Chief Constable had a duty to warn Ms Woodcock about her neighbour’s information that Guzelyurt was loitering nearby.
Ritchie J analysed relevant case law, referring to the general rule that the police are not liable in civil law for failing to catch criminals or to prevent crime.  He identified the exceptions to that general rule as being cases in which the police had assumed a specific responsibility to protect a specific member of the public from attack by a specific person or persons, and cases in which exceptional or special circumstances existed which created a duty to act to protect the victim and/or it would be an affront to justice if they were not held to account to the victim.  He referred to the recent decision of this court in Tindall CA, but at [103] he distinguished it, on the basis that in the present case the police were under a duty to warn Ms Woodcock, whereas Michael –
“… was not a duty to warn case, it was a failure to protect by arresting the protagonist case.”
He added that both the cases considered by the court in Van Colle and Smith were “failure to protect cases, not failure to warn cases”.
On the facts of the present case, Ritchie J held that it was reasonably foreseeable to the Chief Constable, after the neighbour’s 999 call and against the background of previous incidents, that Ms Woodcock was at high risk of serious injury from Guzelyurt.  There was undisputed evidence that Guzelyurt had recently threatened to kill Ms Woodcock or to commit serious crimes against her and her children.  The police were aware that Guzelyurt had repeatedly failed to comply with bail conditions which were intended to protect Ms Woodcock.  Taking into account events on the night of 18 April, the judge held that Ms Woodcock was relying on the advice and the safety plan given to her by the police.  He said there was little point in advising Ms Woodcock to ask neighbours to keep a lookout for Guzelyurt if the police were not going to inform her of the neighbour’s 999 call.
Ritchie J concluded that there were exceptional circumstances which gave rise to a common law duty on the Chief Constable to call Ms Woodcock once they received the neighbour’s information:
“That duty arose immediately after the neighbour’s phone call as a result of the factors set out above and the content of the phone call.  However, for the reasons set out in the House of Lords’ and Supreme Court’s decisions set out above (Hill  and Smith and Van Colle and Michael) I do not consider that there was a civil law duty to protect the claimant physically, beyond providing the warning, despite the clear operational objective to arrest [Guzelyurt].”
Ritchie J further found that the Chief Constable had assumed a responsibility to warn Ms Woodcock if a neighbour provided the police with information that Guzelyurt was lurking outside Ms Woodcock’s house just as she was due to leave to go to work; and that the Chief Constable had breached the duty by failing to warn Ms Woodcock by telephone.
As to causation, the judge said that an error by Ms Woodcock’s legal representatives, in failing to call evidence on that issue, should not be laid at her door.  He said that he was minded to draw an inference that Ms Woodcock would have waited in the house if she had been warned of Guzelyurt’s presence outside, but –
“… it seems to me that in these circumstances there is no scope for this court to declare that the judge’s decision that there was no evidence upon which to make a finding that any breach by the defendant caused the loss was wrong. However, I do consider that it was unjust under CPR r52.21(2)(b).  Therefore, I rule that this case shall be remitted to the trial judge (if available) to hear evidence on causation … “
The judge accordingly allowed the appeal.
Ms Woodcock’s case: the grounds of appeal
The Chief Constable puts forward three grounds of appeal.  In ground 1, it is submitted that Ritchie J was wrong to find that the Chief Constable owed Ms Woodcock a duty of care, in particular because he wrongly distinguished Michael and other cases on the basis that they were not “duty to warn” cases; wrongly found that a duty of care arose because of special or exceptional circumstances; and wrongly found an assumption of responsibility on the facts found by Judge Murdoch.
In ground 2, it is submitted that Ritchie J was wrong to overturn Judge Murdoch’s finding that there was no breach of duty, and that in doing so he mischaracterised Judge Murdoch’s findings and reversed the burden of proof.
In ground 3, it is submitted that Ritchie J wrongly remitted causation, despite having found that Judge Murdoch’s decision on that issue was not wrong.
Ms Woodcock submits that Ritchie J’s decision should be upheld for the reasons he gave.  In a Respondent’s Notice, she puts forward alternative grounds on which she submits this court could uphold the decision.
The cases of CJ and others: the facts
As we have noted in paragraph 2 above, these proceedings arose out of sexual crimes committed by MP.  In 1998 MP’s father, BP, had been imprisoned for sexual offences against his daughter DJ (MP’s sister).  After he had been released from that sentence, BP gave an old laptop computer to another daughter, CP: precisely when he did so is not clear, but it appears to have been a significant time before December 2012.  The laptop was used by various members of the family.  When using it in December 2012, CP discovered a folder containing indecent images of children.  She told her mother, who questioned each of the male members of the household, including MP, who was then aged 16.  No one admitted responsibility for the images.  Unsurprisingly, suspicion fell on BP.  CP and her mother went to a police station and reported what had been found.
Detective Sergeant Ellerby, accompanied by another police officer, went to the house that evening and seized the laptop.  He looked at the images contained in the relevant file.  He checked the properties of that file and found that it had been created earlier in December 2012.  He did not question anyone in the household, or BP.  He entered the case on a Wiltshire Police information management system known as Niche.  He also made an entry in an Occurrence Log in which he referred to BP’s status as a convicted sex offender, and noted that he would submit the laptop for examination -
“… because should the creation of that folder/document pre-date the time when [CP] was handed the laptop (about a year ago) then I will have cause to speak with [BP].”
DS Ellerby submitted a request to the Hi-Tech Crime Unit (“HTCU”) to examine the laptop.  Under a triage procedure used by the HTCU, this task was given middle to low priority, in part because BP was a known sex offender who was already being managed by the Public Protection Unit.  The examination was completed in April 2014.  Eight indecent images of children were found, all of which had been created on the laptop in December 2012.  None was in the most serious category of imagery, category A.  One image was in category B (“non-penetrative sexual activity”) and seven were in category C (“other indecent images not falling into categories A or B”).
Whilst the laptop was awaiting examination, DS Ellerby decided in August 2013 to close the case on Niche.  He later explained that he had done so because a Niche record which remained open for some time, without being updated, would be poorly received, and he “wanted an inbox that made him and his team look good”.
In May 2014 DS Ellerby received the report of the HTCU’s examination of the laptop, which pointed to MP as the person who downloaded the indecent images.  DS Ellerby was also given a police laptop, onto which the contents of the seized laptop had been loaded so that they could be used in interviews, and was told that it would be valid for six weeks.  DS Ellerby did not take any further action, did not update the Niche record with details of what had been found on the seized laptop, and did not seek any advice as to what he should do.  He returned the police laptop to the HTCU in September 2014.
In late February 2015, OB told his mother that MP had forced him to watch rude pictures.   That complaint was reported to the police on 26 February 2015.  MP’s contact with OB was immediately ended, and a police investigation was begun by a member of the Child Abuse Investigation Team.
On 9 April 2015, HD’s mother reported MP to the police for sexual abuse of HD.  MP was arrested the following day.  The investigation of that complaint was linked to the investigation of OB’s complaint, and Detective Sergeant Sweeney was appointed as the officer in the case.
In June 2015 DS Ellerby discovered that MP was the subject of a separate investigation into allegations of sexual assaults.  He contacted DS Sweeney and provided him with a copy of the HTCU report.  In August 2015 DS Sweeney formally took over DS Ellerby’s investigation.
The images had in fact been created by MP.  He had gone on to commit sexual offences against each of the claimants.  The charges to which he pleaded guilty alleged offences between November 2013 and  April 2015.  On three occasions (1 August 2012, 10 February 2014, and 20 January 2015) he was the subject of enhanced checks by the Disclosure and Barring Service, to each of which the police responded by saying that no relevant information was recorded.  He was able to obtain work as a child minder, and the parents of OB, HD and PD engaged him in that capacity.
For convenience, MP’s offending has been divided into two periods:
Between 21 December 2012 (when the laptop was seized) and 19 May 2014 (when the HTCU examination was completed), MP sexually abused his nephew CJ (then aged 10-12) and his niece PJ (aged 5-7).
Between 20 May 2014 and 1 July 2015 (when MP was arrested), he sexually abused HD (then aged 9), PD (aged 7) and OB (aged 6).  The latest date of offending covered by the charges to which he pleaded guilty in relation to those victims was 8 April 2015.
In November 2015, MP pleaded guilty to the 40 offences which we have summarised at the start of this judgment. He was sentenced in March 2016 to a total of 10 years’ imprisonment.
In July 2017 a disciplinary panel found that during the second period, DS Ellerby had shown a lack of integrity because he had neither actively advanced the investigation nor handed it over to someone more experienced.  The panel found that his serious failings justified dismissal, but did not dismiss him because of the generous stance taken by the parents of the abused children.
The cases of CJ and others: the proceedings below
The five claimants brought proceedings against the Chief Constable, initially as three separate claims which were later consolidated.  All five pursued claims for breach of their rights under article 3 of the Convention, which provides:
“Prohibition of torture
No one shall be subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.”
CJ and PJ also claimed damages for negligence: the remaining claimants accepted that they could not succeed in negligence as the law stood, but reserved their positions in case the law changed.  The basis of all the claims, in a nutshell, was that DS Ellerby’s failings had resulted in MP being able to avoid detection as the person responsible for the indecent images, and so being able to go on to commit the offences against the claimants.
Martin Spencer J dismissed all the claims.  He found that Wiltshire Police, through DS Ellerby, had been negligent in investigating the indecent images found on the laptop.  He held that DS Ellerby should have enquired at an early stage how long the HTCU would be likely to take to examine the laptop.  He would probably have been told it would take 12 months.  He should then have started interviewing those who had access to the laptop, starting with BP.  The judge held that DS Ellerby would probably have found that BP was unlikely to be responsible for downloading the images.  In the judge’s view, interviewing of MP would then have been likely to elicit admissions.  Although a prosecution would probably have had to await the outcome of the HTCU’s examination of the laptop, the investigation would have been kept open and MP would have been noted on Niche.  The enquiries made about MP would not then have resulted in “no relevant information” responses: on the contrary, the police would have regarded MP as a person who was not suitable to work with children.
On that basis, the judge held that, if DS Ellerby had acted appropriately, MP would not have been given any opportunity to abuse CJ and PJ, and would not have been employed as a child minder to look after any of HD, PD or OB.
The judge then reflected on case law (including the recent decision of this court in Tindall CA) which established that public authorities are generally under no common law duty of care to prevent the occurrence of harm.  He noted the concession that HD, PD and OB could not succeed in their claims for negligence, because DS Ellerby’s failures had constituted a failure to confer a benefit.  He considered the submissions on behalf of CJ and PJ to the effect that DS Ellerby had committed positive acts which had either made the danger to them from MP worse than it was, or had created a new danger.  He also considered the submissions on behalf of those claimants that they could bring their cases within the Tofaris and Steel exceptions.
At paragraphs 75-76 of his judgment, the judge concluded:
The fundamental question, in my judgement, is whether DS Ellerby owed a duty of care towards these claimants.  Thus, failing to confer a benefit will not generally bring a person, or a public authority, within the sphere of tortious liability in negligence, even where the public authority has a duty to act but fails to do so.  But making matters worse by one’s actions does give rise to a duty of care: in a sense, the law thus echoes the first duty of a doctor, namely ‘do no harm’.
In my judgement, Mr Holdcroft is correct when he submits that, properly analysed, the positive acts relied on by the claimants on the part of DS Ellerby are no more than omissions or failings on his part to act, in disguise. …”
The judge went on to find, at paragraph 82, that DS Ellerby had acted ineffectually rather then made matters worse. Moreover, DS Ellerby had never specifically been alerted to the risk of contact offences by MP.
As to the claims for breach of the appellants’ rights under article 3 of the Convention, the judge noted that it was common ground between the parties that the sexual abuse suffered by the claimants amounted to inhuman treatment for the purposes of article 3.  He referred to the decision of the Supreme Court in D v Commissioner of Police for the Metropolis [2018] UKSC 11, [2019] AC 196 (“D”), which he summarised as follows:
The Human Rights Act 1998 imposes on the state a general duty rigorously to enforce laws which prohibited conduct constituting a breach of article 3 of the Convention so as effectively to deter such conduct, which requires that complaints of ill-treatment amounting to a violation of article 3 be properly investigated (the ‘investigative duty’).
The positive obligation on the part of state authorities to investigate complaints arises both where state involvement in the acts said to breach article 3 was alleged and also in circumstances where non-state agents were responsible for the infliction of the harm.
Even serious failures which are purely operational will suffice to establish a claim that an investigation carried out pursuant to an article 3 duty infringed the duty to investigate, provided that they were egregious and significant and not merely simple errors or isolated omissions.”
Martin Spencer J rejected the appellants’ submission that he should be concerned with the whole investigation into MP, beginning with DS Ellerby on 21 December 2012 and ending when DS Sweeney took over on 19 August 2015.  He accepted the submission of the Chief Constable that the investigation which began in December 2012 was concerned with the provenance of the indecent images, and did not engage article 3; whereas the investigation which began in April 2015 concerned the abuse of HD and PD (and later OB, CJ and PJ) following the first report of a contact offence.  This second investigation, he held, did engage article 3.
Martin Spencer J found no failure in the process of triage and examination of the seized laptop (a finding which is not now challenged), but held that DS Ellerby was guilty of a number of culpable failures, which resulted in the appellants suffering abuse which they would otherwise not have suffered.  He found, at [95], that the failures after DS Ellerby had received the HTCU report in May 2014 were egregious, but that his failures before that time were not.
Martin Spencer J held, however, that DS Ellerby’s investigation was never an article 3 investigation, and could not be transformed into one by MP’s subsequent sexual abuse of his victims.  The article 3 duty was only “animated” in April 2015, when DS Sweeney began his investigation into the reports of sexual abuse by MP.  He reached those conclusions on the basis of D, which made clear that the duty under the Human Rights Act was to investigate ill-treatment amounting to a violation of article 3.
The essence of the judge’s ruling on the article 3 claims was expressed as follows at paragraph 119 of his judgment:
“This [the decision in D] shows that there is a wide range of failures, both operational and systemic, which will fall within article 3; but it must surely be the premise for such liability that the investigation in question is into conduct which is, and is known by the police to be, conduct engaging article 3.  Thus, my decision does not represent a retreat from the requirement ‘to take such preventative operational measures that, judged reasonably, might be expected to avoid the risk’ …: that requirement remains in all its potency, but the risk must be identified at the time.”
The cases of CJ and others: the grounds of appeal
The grounds of appeal of CJ and others challenge the judge’s conclusions in relation to their article 3 claims (grounds 1-3) and claims in negligence (grounds 4-7).
In ground 1, it is submitted that the judge erred in law in (a) concluding that the Chief Constable’s investigative obligation under article 3 was only animated on 9 April 2015, when the police became aware (through HD’s mother’s report: see paragraph 58 above) that HD and PD had been sexually abused, and/or (b) in rejecting other suggested pathways by which the judge should have found that the police had failed to do all that could reasonably be expected of them to prevent a breach of the claimants’ article 3 rights.
In ground 2, it is submitted that the judge erred in law in failing to find that the duty of the police to carry out an article 3 compliant investigation arose throughout both the first and the second periods.
In ground 3, it is submitted that the judge was wrong to find that the failures of the police during the first period were not egregious.
In ground 4, it is submitted that the judge failed to make relevant findings as to the action which DS Ellerby should have taken, given that he had no training or experience in investigating child sexual offences.
In ground 5, it is submitted that the judge was wrong to view some of DS Ellerby’s conduct as pure omissions rather than actions.
Alternatively, it is submitted in ground 6 that on the findings which the judge made as to DS Ellerby’s acts and omissions, he should have found that one or more of the Tofaris and Steel exceptions applied.
In the further alternative, it is submitted in ground 7 that the judge should have analysed the claim by reference to the principles in Caparo and should have found that it was fair, just and reasonable to impose liability in negligence on the police.
All those grounds of appeal are resisted by the Chief Constable.
Before coming to the submissions to this court, we must refer to the most recent decision of the Supreme Court.
Tindall SC
The single judgment was given by Lord Leggatt and Lord Burrows, with whom Lord Hodge, Lord Briggs and Lady Simler agreed.  The opening paragraph of the judgment stated the basic principles:
“It has long been recognised that the tort of negligence draws a fundamental distinction between acts and omissions or, in the more illuminating language adopted in recent years, between making matters worse (or harming) and failing to confer a benefit (or to protect from harm). As a general rule, a person has no common law duty to protect another person from harm or to take care to do so: liability can generally arise only if a person acts in a way which makes another worse off as a result. In recent years this distinction has taken on added significance because it is now firmly established (or re-established) that the liability of public authorities in the tort of negligence to pay compensation is governed by the same principles that apply to private individuals. Many public authorities – notably, protective and rescue services such as the police force and fire brigade – have statutory powers and duties to protect the public from harm. But failure to do so, however blameworthy, does not make the authority liable in the tort of negligence to pay compensation to an injured person unless, applying the same principles, a private individual would have been so liable. That means that to recover such compensation a claimant generally needs to show that the public authority did not just fail to protect the claimant from harm but actually caused harm to the claimant.”
Their Lordships stated that, on the facts of the case, the failure of the police officers to protect road users from the danger caused by the ice was undoubtedly a serious dereliction of their public duty owed to society at large.  It did not, however, follow that they were in breach of a duty of care in the tort of negligence owed to particular individuals.  At [43], their Lordships referred to the passage which we have quoted from the Tofaris and Steel article (see paragraph 15 above) as “a useful starting-point for analysis” of exceptions to the general rule.
At [44], their Lordships summarised the principles to be derived from the main cases, including the following:
There is a fundamental distinction … between making matters worse, where the finding of a duty of care is commonplace and straightforward, and failing to confer a benefit (including failing to protect a person from harm), where there is generally no duty of care owed.
…
A difficulty in drawing the distinction (between making matters worse and failing to protect from harm) is how to identify the baseline relative to which one judges whether the defendant has made matters worse … The cases show that the relevant comparison is with what would have happened if the defendant had done nothing at all and had never embarked on the activity which has given rise to the claim. The starting point is that the defendant generally owes no common law duty of care to undertake an activity which may result in benefit to another person. So it is only if carrying out the activity makes another person worse off than if the activity had not been undertaken that liability can arise.
Another way of stating the general rule is to say that a person owes a duty to take care not to expose others to unreasonable and reasonably foreseeable risks of physical harm created by that person’s own conduct.  By contrast, no duty of care is in general owed to protect others from risks of physical harm which arise independently of the defendant’s conduct, whether from natural causes … or third parties … .”
Their Lordships then referred to exceptions to the general rule where, for example, a defendant has assumed a responsibility to protect a person from harm, or has control of a third party.
At [56] their Lordships approved, as a correct statement of law, the “interference principle” expressed as follows in McBride and Bagshaw, “Tort Law”, 6th ed at p213:
“If A knows or ought to have known that B is in need of help to avoid some harm, and A knows or ought to have known that he has done something to put off or prevent someone else helping B, then A will owe B a duty to take reasonable steps to give B the help she needs.”
That principle, they said, was simply an illustration of the duty of care not to make matters worse by acting in a way that creates an unreasonable and reasonably foreseeable risk of physical injury to the claimant.
On the facts of Mr Tindall’s case, it was held that the claimant failed because there was no evidence that the police were aware that Mr Kendall had been trying to warn other motorists.  The information which Mr Kendall had given to the call handler was entirely consistent with his seeking assistance for himself, and gave no reason to think that he had attempted, or would attempt, to warn other motorists of the ice on the road.  The claimant’s evidence had focused on what Mr Kendall said he would have done if the police had not arrived.  But the crucial question was whether the police could reasonably have foreseen that their attendance would displace attempts which Mr Kendall would otherwise have made to prevent other road users from suffering harm.  It was therefore critical to establish what the police knew or ought to have known about the role of Mr Kendall, and what he would have done if the police had not attended.  So far as the police were concerned, Mr Kendall was a victim of a road traffic accident, not a rescuer.
As to the claimant’s arguments based on an assumption of responsibility by the police, it was held at [76]:
“The basic stumbling-block for any argument based on assumption of responsibility in this case is the complete absence of any communication or interaction between the police officers who attended the scene of Mr Kendall’s accident and Mr Tindall. The police officers did not say or do anything of which Mr Tindall (or other motorists who drove along the relevant section of road after the police had left) were aware, or on which they could have relied. We find it impossible to see in these circumstances how an assumption of responsibility could be said to arise.”
At [84], their Lordships confirmed the principle that –
“… taking steps which are ineffectual, whether because they are inadequate to begin with or because the defendant does not persist in them, cannot give rise to a duty of care.”
Their Lordships concluded that none of the grounds alleged for there being a duty of care owed by the police to Mr Tindall stood up to scrutiny.  Applying the interference principle, the police could not be held liable for making matters worse, and none of the possible exceptions to the general rule, that there is no duty of care to protect a person from harm, could be made out.  The claimant’s appeal against the decision in Tindall CA was therefore dismissed.
We turn now to the submissions made to this court in each of the present cases.  We are grateful to all counsel for their assistance.  The submissions were lengthy and detailed.  We will summarise them quite briefly, but we have considered all of the points which were made on each side.
The submissions to this court: Ms Woodcock’s case
Mr Warnock KC relies on Michael, Robinson and other decisions of the highest court as establishing that a public authority does not owe a duty of care where a private citizen would not do so, even if the public authority has public law powers or duties which enable or require it to prevent the harm concerned.  He points to the decisions in those cases as illustrating the distinction between an omission, such as a failure to protect from harm or a failure to make a situation better (Michael; and Poole Borough Council v GN [2019] UKSC 25, [2019] 2 WLR 1478 (“Poole”)), and conduct which creates the relevant danger and causes harm (Robinson).  The failure to warn Ms Woodcock, he submits, was an omission, a failure to confer a benefit or make things better, and Judge Murdoch had therefore been correct to identify this case as being covered by the principles stated in Michael.  Ritchie J, it is submitted, was wrong to hold that there was a duty to warn, because the giving of a warning would simply be a method of protecting Ms Woodcock from harm caused by another.
It is further submitted that in finding that a duty of care arose because of special or exceptional circumstances, Ritchie J had in effect applied a tripartite Caparo test and had thereby departed from the correct approach stated in Robinson.  Ritchie J had, moreover, wrongly conflated issues of duty with issues relevant to breach of duty: relying on Hill v Chief Constable of West Yorkshire [1989] AC 53 at [60] and Mitchell v Glasgow City Council [2009] UKHL 11, [2009] 1 AC 874 at [15], Mr Warnock KC submits that neither knowledge of a danger, nor foreseeability of harm, is in itself sufficient to impose a duty of care on the police.
Next, it is submitted that Ritchie J was wrong, on the facts, to find that the police had assumed a responsibility to Ms Woodcock.  The police had not promised to warn Ms Woodcock of any sighting of Guzelyurt near her home, or to pass on any warning given by a neighbour or to respond within a particular timescale to any information they received from a neighbour.  Applying the principles summarised in Tindall CA at [54], which we have quoted at paragraph 19 above, it is submitted that the present case is, at most, one in which the assistance provided by the police was ineffectual.
As to ground 2, it is submitted that Judge Murdoch was entitled, on the evidence he heard, to find that the police had not acted unreasonably and that they were not negligent in failing to pass on to Ms Woodcock the information received from the neighbour.  It is submitted that there was no basis on which Ritchie J could properly go behind those findings. Mr Holdcroft argues that Ritchie J wrongly conflated the role of the call handler and the role of police officers on the ground.  Here, he submits, the call handler rightly assessed the risk level as “immediate” and rightly passed the information to the police.  The police then made an operational decision to respond by immediately attending the scene rather than by making a telephone call to Ms Woodcock.  There was no evidence that they acted unreasonably in so doing, and therefore (it is submitted) Ms Woodcock could only establish a breach of duty if the police were under a specific duty to warn her.
As to ground 3, it is submitted that Judge Murdoch was correct to hold that Ms Woodcock had failed to adduce any evidence that, but for the conduct of the police, she would have acted differently and would not have left her house.  She had thus failed to discharge the burden of proof on the issue of causation.  It is suggested that Ritchie J, though referring (as we have noted at paragraph 47 above) to CPR 52.21(2)(b), was in fact purporting to rely on CPR 52.21(3).  But, it is submitted, that rule can only apply where there has been a serious procedural or other irregularity in the proceedings below: Ritchie J identified no such irregularity, and (it is submitted) there was none.
In response, Mr Bowen KC submits that Ritchie J was correct to find that the police were under a duty to warn Ms Woodcock of the imminent risk of attack by Guzelyurt.  That duty was owed, it is submitted, for three reasons:  first, because the police added to the existing danger and made things worse, by failing to pass on the neighbour’s warning;  secondly, because the police interfered with the neighbour, who (but for the involvement of the police) would have warned Ms Woodcock; and thirdly, because the police exercised sufficient control and assumed responsibility to give a warning.  The concluding words of the call handler, which we have quoted at paragraph 33 above, are relied on as an assurance to the neighbour that the police would warn Ms Woodcock of Guzelyurt’s presence outside her home.  It is submitted that the case law makes clear that there are exceptions to the omissions principle, and that in the present case those exceptions applied so as to permit the finding of a duty to warn.
It is further submitted that, correctly analysed, the conduct of the police in this case made matters worse and increased the danger.  Ms Woodcock and the neighbour had both acted in accordance with the police advice which we have summarised at paragraph 30 above, but the police had neutralised that advice (by failing to pass on the neighbour’s warning); and because of the assurance which it is submitted was given by the call handler, the court should infer that the neighbour would have alerted Ms Woodcock if the police had not given that assurance.  It is submitted that Ms Woodcock was therefore not in the same position as she would have been if the police had done nothing.
Mr Bowen KC also relies on the Tofaris and Steel exceptions.  It is submitted that the police assumed a responsibility to warn Ms Woodcock, in particular because they had provided a watch on her house earlier that night (the first exception).  As to the second exception, reliance is placed on the suggested assurance to the neighbour.  As to the third exception, it is submitted that the police had a significant degree of control over Guzelyurt because they had decided to arrest him, had searched for him, had been provided by the neighbour with specific information as to where he was, and could prevent the danger to Ms Woodcock by passing on the neighbour’s warning.  As to the fourth exception, it was initially submitted that the status of the police as a trained, professional rescue service is a relevant consideration in deciding whether, in particular circumstances, a duty of care should be imposed on them even though it would not be imposed on a private citizen.  That submission was however abandoned in oral argument before us, Mr Bowen KC conceding that status itself was not enough.
Ms Woodcock accordingly submits that the appeal should be dismissed.  Ground 1 should fail because Ritchie J was correct to distinguish Michael on its facts and to find that a duty of care did exist.  Ground 2 should fail because the police had adduced no evidence to explain the failure to pass on the neighbour’s warning: either Sgt Randall, or the call handler, or the system operated in the call room had made a plain error.  As to ground 3, either Ritchie J was correct to remit the issue of causation; or alternatively, as pleaded in the Respondent’s Notice, remittal was unnecessary because it was obvious that Ms Woodcock, if warned, would have stayed in her house until the police arrived.
The submissions to this court: the cases of CJ and others
Addressing first the grounds of appeal relating to the article 3 claim, Mr Chapman submits that the investigative obligation under article 3 was engaged in December 2012, when DS Ellerby seized the laptop;  or in May 2014, when the laptop was returned to DS Ellerby after being analysed; or at latest in February 2015, when allegations of abuse of OB were first reported to the police.  Martin Spencer J was therefore wrong to find that the obligation was only engaged in April 2015, when the police learned that HD and PD had been abused.  It is submitted that the possession of the indecent images, whilst it did not in itself amount to ill-treatment for the purposes of article 3, showed a sexual interest in children and a risk of escalation to contact offending.  The protective principle which lies at the root of the obligation under article 3 was thus engaged; the police were therefore required to do something, though not necessarily very much, to investigate; the discharge of the article 3 duty required at least sufficient work to identify MP as the principal suspect; and the police, it is argued, were guilty of egregious failures to identity MP as the man responsible for downloading the imagery.  The failure, it is submitted, was not simply that of DS Ellerby, though his failings were egregious throughout: the police should have operated systems which would have identified his inactivity.  Relying on DSD v Commissioner of Police for the Metropolis [2015] EWCA Civ 646, [2015] 3 WLR 966, Mr Chapman submits that compliance with the article 3 duty would have required only minimal effort on the part of DS Ellerby, but the failure to discharge that duty had the serious consequence that MP was not debarred from working with children.
In relation to ground 2, it is submitted on behalf of the appellants that Martin Spencer J was wrong to limit consideration of the article 3 claim to the period after DS Sweeney’s investigation of MP had begun.  Whether article 3 ill-treatment was foreseeable by DS Ellerby when he seized the laptop would be relevant to the claim in negligence, but not, it is submitted, to the state’s investigative and preventative obligations under article 3 – which arose because it was foreseeable that article 3 ill-treatment would occur as a result of the earlier, egregious operational failures.
As to ground 3, it is submitted that DS Ellerby was not justified in assuming that BP was the person most likely to have downloaded the imagery, and that Martin Spencer J failed to give sufficient weight to the adverse findings of the disciplinary panel.  Martin Spencer J also failed, it is submitted, to take into account DS Ellerby’s conduct in retaining the investigation when he had no relevant experience in order to improve his own skill set, and in failing to seek advice or to undertake any investigation.
Turning to the grounds of appeal relating to the claims in negligence by CJ and PJ, Mr Bowen KC submits that Martin Spencer J was wrong to characterise DS Ellerby’s conduct as pure omissions: he should have found that DS Ellerby’s decision to retain the case was a negligent positive act which increased the danger facing CJ and PJ and made matters worse.  So, too, were his decisions to close the case on Niche, and not to pursue the investigation after he had received the report from the HTCU.  This is not, it is submitted, a case of DS Ellerby doing nothing.  Nor is it a case of ineffectual assistance: DS Ellerby made matters worse by retaining the case for self-serving reasons and thus preventing an appropriate investigation by better-qualified officers.
It was submitted in writing that the case could also be regarded as falling within each of the Tofaris and Steel exceptions, and that Martin Spencer J was wrong to hold otherwise.  It was argued that DS Ellerby assumed responsibility to CJ and PJ (exception 1), holding himself out as being able to investigate indecent imagery when he knew or ought to have known that CJ and PJ were at risk of harm.  DS Ellerby prevented others from protecting CJ and PJ (exception 2) by excluding the involvement of other officers who would have carried out an appropriate and effective investigation.  The ability of the police to arrest, interview and further investigate MP, when he had been identified as responsible for downloading the imagery, was a sufficient degree of control to satisfy exception 3.  Finally, Martin Spencer J failed to consider the status of the police as a well-resourced public authority charged with the investigation and prevention of crime (exception 4).  In oral submissions, however, Mr Bowen KC told us that he did not pursue the first and third exceptions, and made “no particular point” on the fourth.  His oral submissions were therefore focused on the second exception and on the argument that DS Ellerby’s conduct made matters worse.
In response, Mr Warnock KC submits that Martin Spencer J’s rulings were correct, for the reasons which he gave.
Submissions were made by both Mr Warnock KC and Ms White in response to the article 3 claims.  It is accepted that in certain circumstances the state has a positive obligation to take preventative operational measures to protect an individual who is at risk.  Ms White referred the court to the summary of the relevant circumstances given by Lewis LJ in AB v Worcestershire County Council [2023] EWCA Civ 529 (“AB”) at [57]:
“The obligation can be seen as comprising four components. There needs to be (1) a real and immediate risk (2) of the individual being subjected to ill-treatment of such severity as to fall within the scope of Article 3 of the Convention (3) that the public authority knew or ought to have known of that risk and (4) the public authority failed to take measures within their powers which, judged reasonably, might have been expected to avoid the risk.”
It is further accepted that there is an obligation to carry out an effective investigation into arguable claims of the infliction of ill-treatment falling within the scope of article 3, and that “egregious and significant” operational failures may be sufficient to establish a breach of that duty.  But, Mr Warnock KC submits, relying on the decision of the Supreme Court in D, that investigatory duty is only engaged when there is an allegation of ill-treatment within article 3.  Martin Spencer J was therefore correct to find that the investigatory duty in this case only arose in April 2015, when the police were informed of an allegation that MP had sexually abused HD.  Until that stage, there had been no allegation of ill-treatment within article 3; and, it is submitted, a generalised risk of future ill-treatment within article 3 is not in itself sufficient to trigger the investigatory duty.
In relation to ground 2, it is submitted that the appellants are here seeking retrospectively to transform an investigation into conduct which did not engage article 3, into an article 3 investigation, because of something which happened later.  That approach, it is submitted, would impose an impossible or disproportionate burden on the authorities, and would produce the remarkable result that a duty was breached before it was even owed.
As to ground 3, it is submitted that the judge was entitled to make the findings he did.
As to the claims in negligence, Mr Warnock KC emphasises the general rules that the police do not owe a duty to an individual to protect him against harm caused by a third party, and that a public authority does not owe a duty of care in the tort of negligence in circumstances where a private citizen would not.  Mr Warnock KC points to the concession by OB, HD and PD that they could  not succeed in a claim based on the tort of negligence, and submits that Martin Spencer J was correct to conclude that CJ and PJ were in no better position.  He further submits that Martin Spencer J was correct to find that this is a case of a failure to protect the appellants from harm caused by a third party, and therefore an omission or failure to confer a benefit, even though DS Ellerby performed some acts.
As to ground 6, it is submitted that none of the Tofaris and Steel exceptions applies in this case.
As to ground 7, it is submitted that in Michael, Robinson and other cases, the highest court has clearly established that there is no duty of care owed to an individual in relation to the investigation of crime.
Discussion: Ms Woodcock’s case
It was, of course, Guzelyurt who was responsible for the attack upon Ms Woodcock and for inflicting serious injuries upon her.  The issue raised by her case is whether the police are liable to her in negligence for failing to prevent that attack, or to warn Ms Woodcock of the imminent risk that it would happen.  Judge Murdoch held that they were not; but Ritchie J held that the police were under a duty to warn her of an imminent attack.  We accept Mr Warnock KC’s submission that Ritchie J fell into error.
Mr Bowen KC disavowed any attempt to overturn the decision in Michael.  He did however advance arguments of public policy, suggesting that by requiring the courts to consider in each case whether a duty would be owed by a private individual as well as by the police, the balance has swung too far in favour of the state.  He submitted that “flexibility” is therefore required, and that detailed analysis of the earlier case law would enable this court to see “a route through”.  In particular, he relied on the statement by Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead in Brooks v Metropolitan Police Commissioner at [6]:
“There may be exceptional cases where the circumstances compel the conclusion that the absence of a remedy sounding in damages would be an affront to the principles which underlie the common law.”
Mr Bowen KC also relied on the reference by Lord Phillips of Worth Matravers in Van Colle and Smith at [97] to the general rule applying “in the absence of special circumstances”; and on the statement by Lord Reed in Robinson at [64] that –
“… absent special circumstances such as assumption of responsibility, the police owed no duty of care to individuals affected by the discharge of their public duty to investigate offences and prevent their commission.”
Insofar as those submissions were an attempt to widen the exceptions to the general rule, or to widen the category of exceptional cases which justify a finding of liability even though none of the established exceptions applies, we are unable to accept them.  They derive no support from the statements of principle so recently made in Tindall SC.  To treat this case as falling into the exceptional category on which Ms Woodcock relies would render the general rule inapplicable in a substantial number of cases, and would be likely to lead to uncertainty and inconsistency.
It is common ground between the parties that there are three relevant general rules.  First, that the common law does not impose liability in the tort of negligence for omissions or failures to act.  Secondly, that the police do not owe a duty to individuals to protect them against harm caused by the criminal actions of a third party.  Thirdly, that foreseeability of harm is not in itself sufficient to give rise either to such a duty or to the narrower duty to warn for which Ms Woodcock contends.  We have no doubt that Ms Woodcock’s case falls within the scope of those general rules, and is not a novel case calling for an assessment of whether it would be fair, just and reasonable to impose liability upon the Chief Constable.  We therefore focus on the submissions of  Mr Bowen KC seeking to bring Ms Woodcock’s case within one or more of the exceptions to those general rules.
We agree with Mr Warnock KC that where a claimant in circumstances such as these asserts an assumption of responsibility by the police, it will usually be necessary for the claimant to show something in the way of a specific representation or promise by the police to take particular action.  It will generally also be necessary to show that the representation or promise was relied on, though that will not be required if, for example, the case concerns an assumption of responsibility towards a vulnerable child: see HXA v Surrey County Council [2023] UKSC 52, [2024] 1 WLR 335 (“HXA”) at [108].  As Poole (especially at [81]) and Sherratt v Chief Constable of Greater Manchester [2019] PIQR P1 illustrate, the question of whether there has been an assumption of responsibility is highly fact-specific.  It is not, however, an “elastic” test in the sense in which Mr Bowen KC appeared to use that term: the court is not free to ignore the general rules, and to stretch the concept of an assumption of responsibility beyond its proper limits.
Here, in our view, the police did nothing which can be regarded as an assumption of responsibility to warn Ms Woodcock or to prevent any attack upon her by Guzelyurt.  They had not promised Ms Woodcock that they would warn her of any sighting of Guzelyurt near her home, and had not promised to pass on to her any information they received alerting them to a danger.  They had not promised to respond within any particular time to any information alerting them to a risk of attack.  The call handler said nothing which could be construed as an assurance that the police would pass on the neighbour’s information to Ms Woodcock or would otherwise prevent any attack upon her.  As we have noted, the facts in Michael were held to be insufficient to justify a finding of an assumption of responsibility. Whilst of course the precise facts of the two cases differ, we are not persuaded by Mr Bowen KC’s submission that there is such a material difference as should lead this court to distinguish Michael.  Nor are we persuaded by Mr Bowen KC’s reliance on HXA in support of his argument that the police should be found to have assumed responsibility despite the absence of either an express representation on the part of the police or evidence that Ms Woodcock relied on the conduct of the police in deciding to leave her house.
Ms Woodcock next invokes the interference principle confirmed by the Supreme Court in Tindall SC at [56] (see paragraph 89 above) and argues that the call handler caused the neighbour to refrain from protective action which she would otherwise have taken.  We accept, of course, that preventing another person from protecting a victim is a form of making matters worse for the victim, and so may give rise to liability.  There must, however, be evidence both that the police knew or ought to have known that the other person intended to act protectively, and that the other person was deflected from doing so by the conduct of the police.
Here, there was no direct evidence as to what the neighbour understood the police would do, or as to what, if anything, she would have done if the call handler had said something different to her.  Mr Bowen KC accepts that he therefore has to rely on a suggested inference as to what the neighbour would have done.  But Judge Murdoch, having heard all the evidence, did not feel able to draw such an inference, and made no finding that the neighbour would have taken action to warn Ms Woodcock herself.  We see no basis on which that assessment of the evidence could be impugned.  Moreover, it seems to us that in the words which we have quoted at paragraph 31 above, including in particular “I don’t really want to get involved”, the neighbour indicated that she did not wish or intend to take any action herself.
Furthermore, there was no evidential basis on which it could be said that the police could reasonably have foreseen that the call handler’s words would cause the neighbour to refrain from taking action which she otherwise would have taken.  Thus there was no evidence to support either of the two features which are essential to the application of the interference principle.
We are unable to accept the submission that the third of the Tofaris and Steel exceptions applies to this case: the police had no more control over Guzelyurt than the police generally have over persons who are suspected of crime but whom it has not yet been possible to arrest.  If this submission were correct, it would render the general rule inapplicable to a substantial proportion of cases in which the police are accused of a culpable omission to act.
We are therefore unable to accept the submissions that this case comes within any of the established exceptions to the general rules which we have mentioned.  Nor do we accept that, despite the principles clearly stated in Michael and other cases, there is scope here for finding exceptional circumstances such as to justify imposing a duty.   It is in our view clear that Ms Woodcock’s case is a case of an omission by the police to act, which did not make matters worse.  Applying the principle stated in Tindall SC at [44(iii)] (see paragraph 87 above), nothing which the police did made Ms Woodcock’s position worse than it would have been if the police had taken no action at all.  With all respect to Ritchie J’s judgment, and to counsel’s detailed arguments on behalf of Ms Woodcock, the principles set out in Michael, Robinson and Tindall CA (by all of which Ritchie J was bound), and reiterated now in Tindall SC, make it impossible to find that the police were under a narrow and specific duty to warn Ms Woodcock.
That being our conclusion, the issues of breach of duty and causation of harm do not arise.  We will however briefly express our views about them.
Had we been persuaded that the police were under the suggested narrow duty to warn Ms Woodcock, we would have accepted the submissions of Mr Davey that the evidence established breach of that duty. Although the police had only limited time in which to alert Ms Woodcock to the neighbour’s warning, they could reasonably have called her on her mobile phone (the number of which was known to the police but not to the neighbour).
As to causation, we must first address Ritchie J’s decision to remit that issue for further hearing (see paragraph 47 above).  We agree with counsel that the judge’s reference in his judgment to CPR r52.21(2)(b) must have been a slip, and that the rule he had in mind was r52.21(3)(b).  The rule provides –
“The appeal court will allow an appeal where the decision of the lower court was –
wrong; or
unjust because of a serious procedural or other irregularity in the proceedings in the lower court.”
Ritchie J did not identify any relevant irregularity.  He referred to an error by Ms Woodcock’s legal representatives in failing to adduce evidence on the issue, but in our view the rule cannot be used as an escape route for an error of that kind: a decision by a party to proceedings about what evidence to adduce or not to adduce is not a serious procedural irregularity within the meaning of the rule, and it does not render unjust a decision properly reached on the basis of the evidence which was adduced.  With respect to Ritchie J, therefore, he fell into error in deciding to remit that issue for further hearing.
We do however see considerable force in the submission that Ritchie J was entitled, and we would be entitled, to decide that the evidence before Judge Murdoch sufficed to prove that Ms Woodcock, if warned that Guzelyurt was outside her home, would have remained indoors until the police arrived, and would thus have escaped injury.  We recognise, of course, that Judge Murdoch, who had heard all the evidence, did not think it proper to draw that inference.  We are nonetheless persuaded that, in the context of Ms Woodcock’s justifiable fear of Guzelyurt, the inference is irresistible.
For the reasons we have given, however, we are satisfied that there was no basis on which the police could be held to have come under the duty of care which is alleged.  The appeal must accordingly be allowed, the decision of Ritchie J set aside and the decision of Judge Murdoch restored.
Discussion: the cases of CJ and others
Turning to the case of CJ and others, we address first the claims based in the tort of negligence.  We can do so quite briefly, and without repeating what we have said in Ms Woodcock’s case about the relevant principles.  It was rightly conceded by three of the appellants that a claim in negligence could not succeed as the law stands.  We are unable to accept the submissions which sought to place CJ and PJ into a separate category.  DS Ellerby’s serious failings were omissions and failures to act, and we reject the attempt to categorise them as positive acts which made matters worse.  Moreover, when considering the test stated in Tindall SC at [44(iii)] (see paragraph 87 above) we accept the submission of the Chief Constable that if DS Ellerby had not taken any action at all, none of the appellants would have been in any better position: MP’s sexual interest in children would have remained undetected, and the abuse of his victims would have occurred.
The general rule, that there is no liability for negligent omissions to act, therefore applies.  As we have noted, only the second of the Tofaris and Steel exceptions was actively pursued; and although the fourth exception was not formally abandoned (as it was in Ms Woodcock’s case), we reject it as without merit.  The principal submission on behalf of CJ and PJ, therefore, is that DS Ellerby made matters worse by preventing other, better-qualified officers from taking over the investigation, or advising him how to go about it, and by causing members of MP’s family to refrain from taking steps to identify the downloader, as they otherwise would have done.  We cannot accept that argument: the first part seeks to characterise as positive acts what were in reality omissions; and the second part lacks any evidential foundation, and is reliant upon speculation as to what MP’s family would have done.
We turn finally to the claims based on breach of article 3.
In X v Bulgaria (2021) EHRC 244 the European Court of Human Rights referred at [184] to the duty under article 3 to conduct an effective investigation arising when an individual “claims on arguable grounds to have suffered acts contrary to article 3”.  At [190] the court added that the nature and degree of scrutiny which satisfied the minimum threshold of the investigation’s effectiveness –
“… depend on the circumstances of the particular case.  They must be assessed on the basis of all relevant facts and with regard to the practical realities of investigation work.”
In December 2012, the images which DS Ellerby saw on the laptop were neither numerous nor of the most serious kind.  We agree with Martin Spencer J that they were not of a level to engage article 3.  But even if they had been, the article 3 rights initially engaged were those of the children depicted in the images, and there is no suggestion that they could be identified.  The appellants argue that the rights of the appellants would become engaged because the protective duty under article 3 required an effective investigation of the downloader having regard to the risk that he had a sexual interest in children which might escalate to contact offences.  We do not accept that argument: a generalised future risk would not suffice to engage the article 3 investigative duty, because it would not satisfy the requirement of a real and immediate risk of ill-treatment in breach of that article: see the principles summarised in AB, cited at paragraph 110 above.
We would add that, in any event, the premise of the appellants’ submission is that DS Ellerby could and should in December 2012 have identified MP as the downloader or the probable downloader.  We find it difficult to reconcile that argument with the appellants’ (entirely realistic) acceptance that Martin Spencer J was entitled to find no culpable failure in the process of triage and examination by the HTCU.  That process was necessary because specialist examination is required before reaching firm conclusions about when and by whom imagery has been downloaded: it would not be appropriate for an officer on the ground, seizing computer equipment, to risk compromising evidence by attempting his own research of the computer.  DS Ellerby’s check of the file properties therefore only provided a basis for suspecting that someone with access to the laptop had downloaded the images very recently.  We are not persuaded that that was enough to identify MP – then a 16 year old boy, with no previous convictions – as the principal suspect.
Martin Spencer J was in our view correct to consider the investigation which began in December 2012 separately from that which began in April 2015, and correct to reject the submission that article 3 was engaged either in December 2012 or at any time prior to April 2015, when contact sexual offending by MP was first alleged.   He was also correct to hold that information about contact offending given to the police in April 2015 could not retrospectively transform the earlier investigation of indecent imagery into an article 3 investigation.  As Mr Warnock KC pointed out, the appellants’ argument to that effect would lead to the conclusion that the police had been in breach of their investigative duty before that duty had arisen.
Thus in our judgement, Martin Spencer J was correct to conclude that the investigative duty only arose when contact offending was reported.  MP was promptly arrested, and it follows that his offending then ended.  The two investigations (DS Ellerby’s and DS Sweeney’s) were linked within a reasonable time thereafter, and there was no failure of the article 3 duty.
For those reasons, we reject the appellants’ submissions in relation both to the common law and article 3.
Conclusion
We therefore allow the appeal of the Chief Constable in Ms Woodcock’s case, and dismiss the appeal of the claimants in the cases of CJ and others.
A final observation: time estimates
Without wanting to criticise individual counsel, we wish to draw attention to a problem which this court sometimes encounters.  Although this appeal hearing was given a very generous time estimate, towards the end of the allotted three days the court was being presented with submissions which were delivered at speed and included what were, in effect, reading lists of case law and other material which counsel would not have time to cover, but which the court was asked to read.  Submissions of that kind are unhelpful.  We therefore emphasise that time estimates are important.  If they are thought to be insufficient, that difficulty must be addressed at as early a stage as possible.  But once the time estimate has been fixed, and any timetable for submissions has been set or confirmed by the court, all advocates must regulate their submissions so that they are completed in time.

In the First-tier Tribunal
(General Regulatory Chamber)
Information Rights
Case number:  EA.2021.0144
Before:  District Judge Moan
Appellant:  Christopher Hart
Respondent: Information Commissioner
Order
(The Tribunal Procedure (First-tier Tribunal) (General Regulatory Chamber) Rules 2009)
It is ORDERED THAT:
1. The Appellant’s request to reinstate this appeal is refused.
2. The appeal is struck out under Rule 8(2)(a) and under Rule 8(3)(c) – the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction to entrain this appeal and it has no realistic prospects of success.
Reasons
From his exhibits, it appears that the Appellant made a FOIA request to the public authority on 2021-February-19.  The attached exhibits included a letter from the Appellant dated 2021-February-19, as posted on 2021-February-20 by special delivery to his GP practice about his transfer from the care of one GP to another.   Under a subject access request, he requested his patient records and personal data as well as other information relating to his care as a patient and information that had been shared.  Under a FOIA request, he also requested the policies and practices regarding extremely vulnerable patients as well as the process of re-registration.
In a letter sent on his behalf, the Appellant emailed the GP Practice on 2021-April-19 acknowledging that he had received some responses but that the practice had not complied with FOIA within the statutory time limits.  The letter reiterated the request for information, although not specifying what information (if any) was still outstanding.  The practice replied on 2021-April-19 reiterating that they had responded on 2021-February-25 and that the decision to place him in the clinically vulnerable group had been made by NHS England and that his GP had changed due to his previous GP leaving the practice, with apologies for any distress incurred as result of that decision.
The Appellant wrote again to the GP practice on 2021-April-20 reiterating hat his requests had not been dealt with.  The Practice responded the same day with links to the policies requested.
The Appellant made a complaint to the ICO on 2021-April-21.  The ICO was provided with the response of the GP practice dated 2021-April-20 confirming that they had responded to the request.  The ICO considered that the response was late but that there was no public interest in serving a formal decision notice noting that they had responded.  This was confirmed to the Appellant on 2021-May-28.  On 2021-June-8 following an email from the Appellant dated 2021-May-28 which was not exhibited, the Appellant was asked to confirm whether he had received the information, whether he considered that it answered his requests and whether he had exhausted the complaints procedure with the GP Practice.  No reply from the Appellant was exhibited to that request from the ICO.
The Appellant contends that he made a complaint under section 50 of FOIA.   That compels the ICO to issue a decision notice and further he submitted that he was not informed of the internal complaints system with the GP practice and so could not instigate those.  He appears to accept the response was given but not within the prescribed 20 working days. The letters from the ICO confirm that they had asked him to confirm whether he had asked for an internal review.  The Appellant suggests that section 50(2)(a) does not apply as his complaint was brought within time.
The ICO has not been asked to respond to this appeal at the present time.  This Order is made after the Registrar put the Appellant on notice that she considered that the Tribunal had no jurisdiction to deal with this appeal and invited the Appellant’s response, which he provided.  The appeal was latterly stayed due to the poor health of the Appellant and consideration is now given as to whether this appeal can proceed as part of his application to reinstate the appeal.  The jurisdiction of the Tribunal to consider the issues is key to the issue of reinstatement; there is little point in reinstating an appeal than cannot be progressed.
The Act does not require a public authority to provide details of their complaint process for the purposes of an internal review albeit it is good practice to do so; there was a complaint procedure on the bottom of both of the letters sent by the GP Practice.  It was likely that the internal review would have been conducted in-house by the medical group, had one been requested.  This could have been instigated by contacting the GP Practice directly.
Section 10 of the Act requires a public authority to respond to information requests “promptly and in any event not later than the twentieth working day following the date of receipt.”  The response appears on the basis of the documents provided to have been late albeit not all documents have been provided to the Tribunal.
A section 50 complaint to the Commissioner can be made for a decision notice whether, in any specified respect, a request for information made by the complainant to a public authority has been dealt with in accordance with the requirements of Part I.  A failure to reply in accordance with section 10 comes within Part 1 of the Act.
The request for information was made in a letter dated 2021-February-19; the Practice said they had responded on 2021-February-28 albeit that response is not exhibited. The letters dated 2021-April-19 and 2021-April-20 clarify what information is sought and this is responded to on 2021-April-20 by the Practice with the information requested.  Even at 2021-May-28 when the ICO responded, the Appellant was in time to ask for an internal review (40 working days from the response) but appeared to choose not to, despite the clear indication from the Commissioner on 2021-May-28 of the timeline for internal review requests and his indication on 2021-June-8 that an internal review was required (and noting that the Appellant was still in time to ask for an internal review as at the date of this letter) before a decision notice could be issued.
The obligation on the Commissioner to make a decision does not apply where any of the conditions in section 50(2)(a)-(d) apply.  There was a complaint process specified in the letters from the Practice although it is likely that the Appellant would be referred to the Practice Manager in the first instance.  The internal review is a pre-cursor to the Commissioner being required to issue a decision notice.  The Commissioner could still issue a decision notice even without an internal review, should he chose to, but that is a matter within his discretion, and as such that exercise of his discretion not to issue a decision notice cannot be appealed to the First Tier Tribunal.  That is a judicial review issue.
Even had an internal review taken place and the Commissioner issued a decision notice to the effect that the information was provided late, the Commissioner was not obliged to take any action on the late delivery of the information requested.  There is no power for the Commissioner to fine the public authority for late provision of information.  The Commissioner’s role is to promote good practice and compliance. In repeated instances of failures to comply with the Act, the Commissioner could choose to issue an enforcement notice requiring compliance with the Act but that would be entirely within the Commissioner’s discretion. The First Tier Tribunal would have no jurisdiction to entertain an appeal against the exercise of the Commissioner’s discretion not to make an enforcement order.  That is a matter for judicial review.
The powers of the First Tier Tribunal on appeal under section 57 of the Act are confined to circumstances where a decision notice has been served; as no notice was issued, no appeal can lie to this Tribunal.  As such the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction to entertain this appeal and it is struck out under Rule 8(2)(a) of the Rules and under Rule 8(3)(c) as having no realistic prospect of success.
The Appellant is on notice of this application and has responded.  Where Rule 8(2)(a) applies, the Tribunal must strike out the appeal, it too has no discretion to allow it to proceed.  To allow a case to proceed otherwise, wastes the valuable resources of the Tribunal.
Accordingly, the application to reinstate this appeal is refused as the appeal has no merit.

This judgment will be handed down by the Judge remotely by circulation to the parties or representatives by email and release to The National Archives. The date and time for hand-down is deemed to be 10am on 15 January 2025.
MASTER PESTER:
Introduction
The Claimant (“Triplark”), is the registered freehold proprietor of Northwood Hall, Hornsey Lane, N6 5PG (“Northwood Hall”), a building comprising 194 flats, and is the current trustee of the service charge funds of the leaseholders of Northwood Hall. Triplark also owns 35 of the flats at Northwood Hall as part of the freehold or pursuant to leases. The various leases to the flats are in substantially similar terms.
The Defendant, Mr Maunder-Taylor, was the statutory manager of Northwood Hall, from 24 June 2016 until 13 September 2019 pursuant to s. 24 of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1987 (“the LTA 1987”).
There are two applications before the Court:
Triplark’s application, dated 15 February 2024, for an order pursuant to CPR r. 24.3 for summary judgment against Mr Maunder-Taylor (“Triplark’s summary judgment application”); and
Mr Maunder-Taylor’s application, dated 16 August 2024, for an order pursuant to CPR r. 3.4(2)(a) and/or (b) striking out all or parts of the Amended Points of Claim; alternatively for reverse summary judgment against the Claimant under CPR Part 24 (“Mr Maunder-Taylor’s counter-application”).
The two applications were listed to be heard together. The two applications are, in substance, mirror images of each other, with both sides contending that the other has no real prospect of succeeding on the whole or parts of their case.
There is a further application, dated 4 November 2024, by Triplark to strike out parts of Mr Maunder-Taylor’s consolidated defence relating to Triplark’s Part 8 claim form, on the ground that this was an abuse of process. I will refer to this as Triplark’s strike out application. The submission, in outline, was that in considering Mr Maunder-Taylor’s consolidated defence, it had become apparent to Triplark that Mr Maunder-Taylor was seeking to run arguments which were contrary to those run in earlier proceedings, and which it was said could and should have been raised in those proceedings. It was submitted that running those arguments at this stage was an abuse of process. Triplark’s strike out application was not formally listed before me. In any event, it was not possible, in the single day allotted to deal with the first two applications, to hear submissions on this second application by Triplark.
A case and costs management conference was held (before me) in these proceedings on 6 March 2024. Although by that point Triplark’s summary judgment application had already been issued, in the event it could not be listed (together with Mr Maunder-Taylor’s counter application) until November 2024. I understand this was due to the difficulty in matching up the dates when leading counsel were available.
There is now a 10 day trial listed in these proceedings, in a 5 day window commencing on 29 April 2025. It is unfortunate that the two applications could not have been heard earlier.
A very considerable volume of material was placed before me, consisting of five lever arch files of documentary evidence, plus two lever arch files of over twenty authorities, as well as various legislative provisions and extracts from textbooks. I accept, of course, that simply because there is a large volume of material, or a number of authorities to consider, that does not make a case unsuitable for summary disposal. However, in this case the quantity and extent of material tends to suggest that neither side’s case is as simple and straightforward as they each maintain it to be.
The proceedings
These proceedings were originally started by way of two claims, a Part 8 claim, in which Triplark sought an account and reconstitution of the statutory trust created by s. 42 of the LTA 1987 for around £2.5million, and a Part 7 claim by Triplark as freeholder and leaseholder seeking damages or restitution up to £2.5million.  By a consent order dated 9 March 2023 Master Kaye ordered that the two claims should be consolidated, with the Part 7 claim being the lead claim.
Background
These claims are one strand of extensive and bitterly contested litigation relating to Northwood Hall. What follows in this section is intended to be no more than a high level summary of the disputes relating to Northwood Hall, so far as is relevant to the decisions I am asked to make.
Northwood Hall is a purpose-built block of 194 flats, constructed in or around 1935. Of the total, 159 flats are held under long leases with varying unexpired terms and the remaining 35 are held by Triplark (34 directly out of its freehold interest and one as long leaseholder).
I understand that from 1987, Triplark’s original interest in Northwood Hall was as Head Lessee. In September 2016, it acquired the freehold reversion through a wholly owned subsidiary. The freehold was transferred to Triplark in March 2018.
A major cause of difficulty at Northwood Hall has been the works to replace the communal heating and hot water system. Triplark obtained advice and estimates about a replacement system in 2009. Some of the lessees were unhappy that the proposed works were making little progress. In 2010, a number of leaseholders decided to exercise their right to establish a Right to Manage company. Accordingly, a Right To Manage company (“the RTM”) was incorporated on 23 June 2010. It acquired the right to manage on 12 January 2011. The RTM was formed with a view to organising a replacement heating and hot water system for Northwood Hall. The RTM appointed managing agents, Canonbury Management (“Canonbury”).
In June 2011 the RTM engaged CBG Consulting (“CBG”) to prepare a design and tenders were invited. On 19 December 2013 the RTM contracted with Parker Bromley Ltd (“Parker Bromley”) for the construction of the heating project. CBG was appointed as contract administrator and Canonbury as project manager. The contract was agreed for the sum of £2.68 million. Professional fees further increased that cost. Works were intended to start in February 2014 and to be completed in December 2014.
I do not think it is necessary to go into detail about the subsequent events save that there was a change of design to the project in 2014 which was controversial and led to increased costs. This and issues of poor management ultimately led to an application dated 14 April 2016 by a number of lessees to appoint Mr Maunder-Taylor as manager under s. 24 of the LTA 1987. Triplark supported that application. By an interim order dated 24 June 2016 (amended on 1 July 2016) the Tribunal appointed Mr Maunder-Taylor. By a final order dated 24 September 2016 he was appointed for three years until 13 September 2019, varied by order dated 27 January 2017.
Mr Maunder-Taylor continued with the heating and hot water project in its amended design and proceeded to install new heating and hot water systems into the individual flats, against opposition from some leaseholders. The demands for service charges and disputes over the installation of the new system led to further litigation, case number D10CL409 (“the Consolidated Action”). The Consolidation Action started as the following proceedings:
A claim commenced by 12 leaseholders seeking relief in relation to works carried out to Northwood Hall by Mr Maunder-Taylor as manager, and also the RTM (this was initially by way of a High Court action seeking injunctive relief to prevent Mr Maunder-Taylor from cutting off the supply of hot water and requiring him to restore the supply of central heating, as well as seeking damages and the recovery of payments made by way of service charge to Mr Maunder-Taylor and the RTM); and
An application made by Mr Maunder-Taylor under s. 27A of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1985 (“the LTA 1985”) as against a separate group of 25 leaseholders for service charge arrears which was subsequently transferred to the County Court.
In the Consolidated Action both sets of tenants sought the recovery of payments made by way of service charge to Mr Maunder-Taylor which they said should not have been made because they were not due.
The Consolidated Action went to trial in April 2019 against Mr Maunder-Taylor alone (in January 2019 the claims by the First and Second Action tenants against the RTM had been settled by way of a Tomlin Order) resulting in a judgment dated 22 May 2019 (“the McGrath Judgment”) and an order of even date (“the McGrath Order”). The hearing before Recorder McGrath took place over eight days, with evidence given by 13 lessees, a Mr Wismayer (Mr Wismayer was a person who some of the leaseholders had originally wanted to be appointed manager, rather than Mr Maunder-Taylor), Mr Maunder-Taylor himself and his service charge accountant Stephen Bird.
Amongst other matters, the McGrath Judgment found that interim service charges were not recoverable unless and until proper notice had been given under the terms of the leases, that the leases made no provision for the accumulation of a reserve fund and that under the leases the landlord had no right to recover the cost of replacing the apparatus within the flats (“the Internal Works”) as part of the service charge.
Further, a recital in the McGrath Order recorded that Mr Maunder-Taylor informed the Court that within 21 days he would amend the statements of accounts of each tenant, to correctly reflect the findings of the Court on the liability for service charge in the periods concerned. Mr Maunder-Taylor accepts that he did not do so, save in relation to the costs orders, although he says that this was not done because the solicitor acting for the tenants never responded to an email seeking details of the settlement with the RTM: see Amended Consolidated Defence, paragraphs 36 - 37. Triplark has been able to recover from Mr Maunder-Taylor some of the legal costs and manager’s costs, as detailed further below.
As part of the McGrath Order a section 20C order was made in favour of the leaseholders who had been parties to the litigation in the Consolidated Action to protect the lessees from paying Mr Maunder-Taylor’s costs.
On 20 August 2018, while the Consolidated Action was ongoing, Mr Maunder-Taylor applied to the First Tier Tribunal (case reference LON/00AP/LSC/2018/0344) under s. 27A of the LTA 1985 seeking a determination of the reasonableness and payability of service charges for the years ending 30 June 2018 and 30 June 2019. Mr Maunder-Taylor later withdrew the application in respect of the year ending 30 June 2019. The application (“the 2018 Tribunal Application”) went to a hearing on 22, 23 July and 4 September 2019 before a panel comprising Mr M Martynski (Tribunal Judge), Mr P Casey and Mr J Francis. The original decision was dated 20 September 2019, amended on 18 October 2019 and reviewed on 10 March 2020 (“the FTT Decision”).
The FTT Decision determined (among other matters):
Legal Fees in the sum of £56,747.14 were not reasonably incurred;
Pipe End Works in the sums of £290,735 and £17,047.20 (total £307,782.20) were not reasonably incurred;
Of the total Management Fees (£69,840) only £58,200 were reasonably incurred leaving £11,640 not reasonably incurred;
£1,629 of the Professional Fees were not a service charge item; and
Manager’s Fees of £28,440 were not reasonably incurred.
The consequence of the findings that costs were not reasonably incurred is that they were not payable by leaseholders under s.19(1) of the LTA 1985.
The FTT Decision was appealed on a separate issue (to do with reserve funds). The appeal was determined by Martin Rodger KC sitting in the Upper Tribunal on 6 September 2019 (“the Upper Tribunal Decision”). The Upper Tribunal found Mr Maunder-Taylor was bound by his concession (despite the terms of the leases) in the Consolidated Action that the leases contained no power to collect contributions towards a reserve fund: see paragraphs 30 and 53. Accordingly, the FTT ought not to have determined that in relation to any of the leaseholders the management order, by itself, authorised Mr Maunder-Taylor to operate a reserve fund by its adoption of the powers in the leases when he was bound by the decision in the Consolidated Action that the leases did not have that effect: at paragraph 59. At paragraph 61, the Upper Tribunal added that:
“I emphasise that this decision does not have any effect on the rights of Triplark, the landlord, to collect a reserve fund. It was not party to the County Court proceedings or to the management order and is not bound by any of the decisions concerning the rights of the leaseholders and the manager.”
On 13 September 2019 Mr Maunder-Taylor’s appointment came to an end and management responsibility reverted to Triplark. Mr Maunder-Taylor continued to manage Northwood Hall on Triplark’s behalf until it appointed new managing agents, KMP Solutions Limited (“KMP”) in December 2019.
It is Triplark’s case that a considerable amount of time was required to undertake a thorough review and reconstruction of the accounts and records produced by Mr Maunder-Taylor, working with accountants Melinek Fine LLP. Triplark says that there has been a huge amount of correspondence in which Mr Maunder-Taylor has been asked to provide proper details, accounting records and/or explanations to enable KMP to put together proper accounts which are fit for purpose, and that this “huge volume of work” has inevitably resulted in substantial professional fees, which would not have been necessary had Mr Maunder-Taylor kept and provided proper accounts and records. These additional losses form part of the Part 7 claim.
In October 2019, Mr Maunder-Taylor credited some sums to the leaseholders in line with the FTT Decision:
£11,640 being that part of the Management Fees deemed to be unreasonable; and
£1,629 being that part of the Professional Fees deemed to be unreasonable.
Triplark has put in evidence that the legal fees of £56,757 for all lessees were recovered from Mr Maunder-Taylor between March 2020 and February 2022. This seems to be accepted in Mr Maunder-Taylor’s witness statement, paragraph 64.
Triplark has put in evidence that there is a balance outstanding from the Manager’s Fees of £11,324.18.
In June 2022 68 leaseholders (being leaseholders of 56 Flats) issued an Application in the First-tier Tribunal (“the s. 27A Application”) for a determination pursuant to s. 27A of the LTA 1985 for service charges in the period 2011-2022 and amongst other matters, a declaration that no service charges are payable for the period when Mr Maunder-Taylor was managing Northwood Hall. Triplark is the sole respondent to the s. 27A Application which went to a final hearing, lasting five days, in December 2023. (As part of these proceedings Triplark claims any losses suffered as a result of the poor management by Mr Maunder-Taylor alleged by the leaseholders in the s. 27A Application.)
A decision was handed down on 24 May 2024, again by Judge McGrath, sitting with a valuer chairman and accountant assigned from the Tax Chamber. The leaseholders in those proceedings sought a determination that the “findings in the McGrath Judgment and Order and those in the Upper Tribunal … should be applied by the Tribunal for the benefit of all leaseholders at Northwood Hall. …” The Tribunal rejected this application, holding that the McGrath Judgment was not binding in rem, and specifically was not binding on Triplark. The Tribunal said this, at [45] - [47]:
We do not accept the Applicant’s submissions. We do not consider the McGrath Order to be binding in rem. Although determinations about service charge cases relate to service charge funds which are held in trust for all leaseholders that is insufficient to justify treating them as having been made in rem. The creation and maintenance of the statutory trust depends, in the first instance, on the terms of the individual leases between the parties. In the county court proceedings, the action was brought against individual lessees and the claim was based on an allegation that those leaseholders were in breach of their leases by their failure to pay specified service charges.
The McGrath Judgment was made in the county court and (save for the section 20ZA decision) was not a Tribunal cases. The rules relating to lead cases in the county court were not engaged. The treatment of lead cases in the Tribunal is governed by rules 24 and 25 of the Procedural regulations. Neither rule applies in this case and nor do they apply generally because specific procedural steps must be taken for them to be engaged. Very importantly all parties and potential parties must be actively involved in order to preserve procedural fairness.
It appears that numerous leaseholders have paid the service charges concerned in the judgment without demur. Section 27A(4)(a) provides that no application under section 27A(1) may be made in respect of a matter which has been agreed or admitted by the tenant. …”
The evidence
The Part 8 claim is supported by two statements from Sarah Finch, Triplark’s solicitor.
In support of Triplark's summary judgment application, Triplark relies on two witness statements of Solomon Mozes, of KMP. Mr Maunder-Taylor has filed a witness statement in response.
Legal test
Triplark’s application for summary judgment under CPR r. 24.2 is brought on the basis that Mr Maunder-Taylor has no real prospect of successfully defending the claim and there is no other compelling reason for a trial. The principles applying when determining a summary judgment application are well-known. The classic statement of principle was set out by Lewison J (as he then was) in Easy Air Ltd v Opal Telecom Ltd [2009] EWHC Ch 339, at [15], in a passage which has been approved by the Court of Appeal in A.C. Ward Ltd v Catlin (Five) Ltd [2009] EWCA Civ 1098 (and applied at first instance on many occasions):
The court must consider whether the claimant (or defendant) has a ‘realistic’ as opposed to a ‘fanciful’ prospect of success: Swain v Hillman [2001] 2 All ER 91;
“A ‘realistic’ claim is one that carries some degree of conviction.  This means a claim that is more than merely arguable: ED & F Man Liquid Products v Patel [2003] EWCA Civ 472 at [8];
In reaching its conclusion the court must not conduct a ‘mini-trial’: Swain v Hillman;
This does not mean that the court must take at face value and without analysis everything that a claimant [or defendant] says in his statements before the court.  In some cases it may be clear that there is no real substance in factual assertions made, particularly if contradicted by contemporaneous documents: ED & F Man Liquid Products v Patel at [10];
However, in reaching its conclusion the court must take into account not only the evidence actually placed before it on the application for summary judgment, but also the evidence that can reasonably be expected to be available at trial: Royal Brompton Hospital NHS Trust v Hammond (No. 5) [2001] EWCA Civ 550;
Although a case may turn out at trial not to be really complicated, it does not follow that it should be decided without the fuller investigation into the facts at trial than is possible or permissible on summary judgment. Thus the court should hesitate about making a final decision without a trial, even where there is no obvious conflict of fact at the time of the application, where reasonable grounds exist for believing that a fuller investigation into the facts of the case would add to or alter the evidence available to a trial judge and so affect the outcome of the case: Doncaster Pharmaceuticals Group Ltd v Bolton Pharmaceutical Co 100 Ltd [2007] FSR 3;
On the other hand it is not uncommon for an application under CPR Part 24 to give rise to a short point of law or construction and, if the court is satisfied that it has before it all the evidence necessary for a proper determination of the question and that the parties have had an adequate opportunity to address it in argument, it should grasp the nettle and decide it. The reason is quite simple: if the respondent’s case is bad in law, he will in truth have no real prospect of succeeding on his claim or successfully defending the claim against him, as the case may be. Similarly, if the applicant’s case is bad in law, the sooner that is determined, the better. If it is possible to show by evidence that although material in the form of documents or oral evidence that would put the documents in another light is not currently before the court, such material is likely to exist and can be expected to be available at trial, it would be wrong to give summary judgment because there would be a real, as opposed to a fanciful, prospect of success. However, it is not enough simply to argue that the case should be allowed to go to trial because something may turn up which would have a bearing on the question of construction: ICI Chemical & Polymers Ltd v TTE Training Ltd [2007] EWCA Civ 725.”
As to strike out, CPR r. 3.4(2) gives the court power to strike out a statement of case which discloses no reasonable grounds for bringing or defending a claim or a statement of case which is an abuse of process. Where, on the material before the court, there are disputed issues of fact, the court should not strike out a claim unless certain it is bound to fail: see per Peter Gibson LJ at [22] in Colin Richards & Co v Hughes [2004] EWCA Civ 226.The point made in that case was that the relevant area of law was subject to some uncertainty and developing, and it was highly desirable that the facts should be found so that any further development of the law should be on the basis of actual and not hypothetical facts. The test is similar but not identical to that for summary judgment where the court will not grant summary judgment, unless the defence has no real prospect of success.
Submissions
Triplark submits that neither the Amended Consolidated Defence, nor Mr Maunder-Taylor’s witness statement, disclose any viable defence, nor does he have a real prospect of defending the claims made in the Part 8 claim, and there is no other reason for the matter to go trial. Although Triplark was not a party to the Consolidated Action, it says that it is a trustee entitled to stand in the shoes of its beneficiaries who were a party, in relation to the subject matter of that trust and submits that its current position as trustee is “… as the defendant’s successor trustee”.
Triplark’s summary judgment application is therefore based on the following propositions:
Triplark alleges that, during Mr Maunder-Taylor’s appointment as manager, he held any service charges on trust under the statutory trust created by s. 42 of the LTA 1987. Mr Maunder-Taylor does not dispute this. S. 42 provides, in relation to dwellings, that where the tenant(s) is/are required to contribute costs by service charge payments, the payee must hold the payments in a separate trust fund or funds.
As regards the Internal Works, Triplark refers to and relies on the McGrath Judgment to say that the sums paid out of the statutory trust for the Internal Works were paid in breach of trust.
As regards the cost of the Pipe End Works (£307,782.20) and management fees, Triplark similarly refers to and relies on the FTT Decision to claim that “these sums were also paid out of the statutory trust in breach of trust”.
Triplark relies on, among other authorities, Holding and Management Ltd v Property Holding and Investment Trust plc [1989] 1 WLR 1313 and St Mary’s Mansions Ltd v Limegate Investment Co Ltd and Others [2003] 1 EGLR 41 to say that costs and expenses incurred or paid out which were not authorised by the relevant leases were not reasonably or properly incurred. The statutory protections provided by s. 42 apply to service charges paid by leaseholders to a tribunal-appointed manager: Suchorski and others v Norton [2021] UKUT 166, at [7]. I did not understand these propositions derived from the authorities to be disputed.
Counsel for Triplark referred to the following passage in Service Charges and Management (5th Edition) section 29-10:
“[Section 42] may provide a remedy against a former landlord who has wrongfully dissipated any service charge money or a sinking fund, for example on works that are not of a reasonable standard or cost, or on works which do not fall within the landlord’s obligations under the terms of the lease. The former landlord would be required to compensate the trust fund. In such a situation, although the lessees could apply to the court, an arbitrator or (in the case of residential service charges) to the appropriate tribunal [being, in England, the FTT, Property Chamber] to determine liability, a determination in their favour would be of little practical benefit because there would no longer be any existing landlord and tenant relationship. In those circumstances, it is suggested that the breach of trust route may provide a more useful remedy.”
I would make two points on this passage. The language used is, perhaps, somewhat tentative (“It is suggested that …”). In any event, no authority is cited where this has been done.
The overall relief sought, as set out in the draft order accompanying the application, is that Mr Maunder-Taylor must account to Triplark and/or reconstitute the statutory trust in respect of the Pipe End Works, a remaining balance of £11,324.18 in relation to management fees, and sums spent on Internal Works, those sums to be determined in a further hearing. The costs of the Internal Works is a much more significant sum, being somewhere in excess of £1.5 million. While the draft order suggests that this further hearing to fix the quantum of the Internal Works is to be listed with a time estimate of two hours, in oral submissions that parties appeared to accept that such a further hearing would be likely to last two or three days. It seems to me that it might be longer.
Triplark’s summary judgment application is thus limited to sums paid out of the service charge account by Mr Maunder-Taylor, in the period during which he was the statutory trustee, in circumstances where there is a judgment by either a Court or Tribunal against Mr Maunder-Taylor (namely, the McGrath Judgment and the FTT Decision) to the effect that those sums are not recoverable from the leaseholders. There is also a claim in relation to a reserve fund, based on the decision of the Upper Tribunal, but this is not something pursued on Triplark’s summary judgment application. Triplark’s position is that, given the effect of those judgments, Mr Maunder-Taylor has clearly paid away trust funds he was not entitled to pay away, and that accordingly he has acted in breach of trust. Further, it is submitted that as Mr Maunder-Taylor was a full participant in the proceedings that resulted in those judgments, he is now bound by them and not entitled to run a defence that contradicts them or is a collateral attack on them. Accordingly, it is submitted that a summary disposal is appropriate.
Mr Maunder-Taylor’s position is that the fundamental premise which underpins Triplark’s summary judgment application is that he is “bound by” the McGrath Judgment and the FTT Decision. However, Triplark was not a party to the McGrath Judgment or to the 2018 Tribunal Application which culminated in the FTT Decision and the Upper Tribunal Decision. Therefore, both the findings of fact and any legal consequences or effects of those findings are inadmissible in these proceedings, and do not give rise to any form of res judicata/estoppel. Accordingly, Mr Maunder-Taylor submits that Triplark’s reliance on the McGrath Judgment and the FTT Decision are in fact “fatal to and/or destructive to its case”.
Discussion and analysis
It is a striking feature of the two applications which I am considering that both parties are saying that the proceedings, or parts of them, can be disposed of summarily in their favour. The starting point for my consideration of the parties’ submissions is that a final adjudication of a legal dispute is conclusive as between the parties to the litigation and their privies as to the matters necessarily determined, and the conclusion on these matters cannot be challenged in subsequent litigation between them (whether in separate proceedings or at a later stage of the same proceedings): see Phipson on Evidence (20th ed, 2021), at 43-23. The corollary of that central principle is that judgments can have no such effect as between strangers or a party and a stranger: ibid, at 43-25.
At one stage it seemed to me as though the real issue between the parties was whether Mr Maunder-Taylor had a real prospect of disputing the proposition that Triplark was “a privy”, either of its beneficiaries, or of Mr Maunder-Taylor as a previous trustee, and therefore entitled to rely on the findings in the McGrath Judgment and the FTT Decision. As explained in Phipson, at 43-27:
“Res judicata estoppels may be relied on by or against privies. Privies may be privy to the parties by blood, title or identity of interest … When deciding whether a person is a privy it is valuable to remember the maxim “estoppels must be mutual”; it being a well-established principle that no one can take advantage of a judgment unless they would have been bound had it gone against them. As instances of successive relationship, judgments for or against an ancestor are evidence for or against his heir; those against a testator bind his executor, legatee or devisee; and the same rule applies to grantees, mortgagees and assignees, provided their titles accrue subsequently to the judgment. So, a judgment against the holder of an office will bind his successor and one against a representative class, a future member of that class. …”
However, in its Amended Reply, at paragraph 22, Triplark pleads that “… it is accepted that the Claimant was not a party to the proceedings in which the McGrath Judgment was given and it therefore does not give rise to res judicata estoppel that the Claimant can directly rely on or benefit from in relation to claims made as freeholder or leaseholder for its own benefit” and at paragraph 29, the Claimant pleads that “… it is accepted that the Claimant was not a party to the 2018 Tribunal Application and the judgments therein do not give rise to res judicata estoppel that the Claimant can directly rely on or benefit from in relation to claims made as freeholder and/or leaseholder for its own benefit.” But the key words in those passages are “as freeholder and/or leaseholder for its own benefit”. Triplark says that it is not relying on the relevant judgment and the decisions as freeholder and/or leaseholder, but as a “successor trustee”.
In fact, Triplark appeared to be saying that it did not need to rely on the principle of res judicata estoppel at all. Instead, Triplark submitted that this was a situation where the McGrath Judgment and the decisions of the FTT Tribunal and the Upper Tribunal were admissible of evidence as to their findings. Triplark stressed that although it was not a party to the Consolidated Action, it is a trustee entitled to stand in the shoes of its beneficiaries who were a party, in relation to the subject matter of the trust.Triplark, as trustee, is seeking to enforce by its Part 8 claim exactly the same trust in relation to which the earlier judgment and decisions have already made findings, and that, in consequence, it was no longer open to Mr Maunder-Taylor to challenge his liability to reconstitute the trust at the suit of Triplark. But, returning to the passage in Phipson, at 43-27 quoted above, parties may be privy “by blood, title or identity of interest”. It did sound to me rather as though Triplark was trying to suggest that there was a privity of interest between it and the beneficiaries of the statutory trust.
I was taken to a number of authorities. The first cited to me was the well-known decision in Hollington v Hewthorn [1943] 1 KB 587. In Hollington v Hewthorn, the plaintiff sought to rely in civil proceedings upon the defendant driver’s criminal conviction for careless driving as evidence of his negligence. The Court of Appeal held that evidence of the conviction was inadmissible. That particular conclusion was repealed by s. 11 of the Civil Evidence Act 1968, which broadly provides that any subsisting conviction by a United Kingdom court is admissible in subsequent civil proceedings (as defined in s. 18(1) of the Act), to prove that the offence was committed by the person convicted, whenever it is relevant to do so. However, the general statement of principle set out in that case as to the effect of a judgment on someone who is not a party remains good law and has been frequently cited with approval in a number of subsequent cases. The statement of principle is as follows:
“… A judgment, however, is conclusive against all persons of the existence of the state of things which it actually affects when the existence of that state is a fact in issue. Thus, if A sues B, alleging that owing to B’s negligence he has been held liable to pay xl. to C, the judgment obtained by is conclusive as to the amount of damages that A has had to pay C, but it is not evidence that B was negligent: see Green v New River Co (1792) 4 Term Rep. 589, and B can show, if he can, that the amount recovered was not the true measure of damage.” (see at pp. 596-7)
Triplark says that the McGrath Judgment and the decisions of the FTT and the Upper Tribunal are admissible evidence of the existence of a liability on the part of Mr Maunder-Taylor, the nature of that liability and the extent of it. Moreover, those findings are set out (or embedded) in the McGrath Order of 22 May 2019 in the County Court at Central London, with the consequence that Triplark is entitled to rely on those findings, even more so because they are findings made against Mr Maunder-Taylor, not as a stranger, but as a party.
In response, Mr Maunder-Taylor says that the central principle to be derived from Hollington v Hewthorn is to ask what was “necessarily determined”. He says that the question whether he was in breach of trust was not necessarily determined. Indeed, s. 42 of the LTA 1987 is not referred to in the McGrath Judgment at all. Mr Maunder-Taylor in the earlier proceedings had no opportunity to raise a defence based on s. 61 of the Trustee Act 1925 (“the Trustee Act”), which provides a power to relieve a trustee either wholly or partly from personal liability, where he has acted honestly and reasonably, and “ought fairly to be excused for the breach of trust and for omitting to obtain the directions of the court in the matter in which he committed such breach …”. In circumstances where no allegation of breach of trust was being pursued, he had no proper opportunity to raise such a defence, and it would be wrong to deprive him now of such an opportunity.
The rule in Hollington v Hewthorn was recently considered in Ward v Savill [2021] EWCA 1378. The issue was whether the appellant claimants could rely on a declaratory judgment granted to them in earlier proceedings, to which the respondent was not a party, to found claims against her in the present proceedings. The Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal, holding that the appellants could not rely on the declaratory judgment to which the defendant was not a party, as it was not a judgment in rem. Sir Julian Flaux noted that the rule in Hollington v Hewthorn still applies in respect of judgments in previous civil proceedings so that a judgment, verdict or award of another tribunal is not admissible evidence to prove a fact in issue or a fact relevant to the issue in other civil proceedings between different parties.
Triplark also took me to the decision of the House of Lords in Reichel v Magrath (1889) 14 App. Case 665. I can take the facts from the headnote. The appellant brought an action against his bishop and the patrons of a benefice claiming a declaration that he was vicar of the benefice, and that an instrument of resignation which he had executed was void, together with an injunction to restrain the bishop from instituting and the patrons from presenting any other person to the benefice. The action was tried and judgment was given against the appellant on the ground that the vicarage was void by reason of his resignation thereof with the consent of the bishop. Afterwards the respondent, having been duly appointed to the benefice as the appellant’s successor, brought an action against the appellant claiming a declaration that the respondent was vicar and a perpetual injunction to restrain the appellant from depriving the respondent of the use and occupation of the house and lands. In his statement of defence the appellant set up the same case as that on which he had been defeated in the action in which he was the plaintiff.
It is hardly surprising that the House of Lords held that there was inherent jurisdiction in the Court to strike out the appellant’s statement of defence as “frivolous and vexatious and an abuse of the procedure”. There is almost no analysis in the various short speeches of the Judicial Committee, and the facts are very different from the case before me. In any event, Reichel v Magrath concerned a particular office, that of vicar, and what was said is not necessarily transferable to the situation of successor trustees.
Triplark also relied on a number of cases where a sole director facing a claim by liquidators of a company seeks “in effect” to relitigate a matter that is already the subject of a judgment against the company. It seems to me that there may be a different principle at work in those cases to the situation before me. In some cases, it is a matter of statutory construction whether the director is allowed to relitigate the issue, or not; and in others, the matter has been decided on the basis of asking whether the defence raised by the director is or is not an abuse of process.
In the first of those cases, Secretary of State for Business Innovation and Skills v Potiwal [2012] EWHC 3273 (Ch), the Secretary of State brought a claim that Mr Potiwal be disqualified as a director under s. 6 of the Company Directors Disqualification Act 1986. The grounds on which disqualification was sought was that a company of which Mr Potiwal had been the director, Red 12 Trading Limited (“Red 12”) had been involved in a fraudulent evasion of VAT, and that Mr Potiwal had caused Red 12 to claim more than £2m by way of VAT refund from HMRC. Mr Potiwal filed evidence that Red 12 did participate in transactions connected with the fraudulent evasion of VAT, but he denied that he either knew or ought to have known that Red 12 was participating in that fraud. The Secretary of State applied to strike out that evidence, on the ground that Mr Potiwal was estopped per rem judicatam from denying that he had the requisite knowledge. Red 12 had previously unsuccessfully challenged a disallowance of the company’s VAT claim in amounts exceeding £2million. Mr Potiwal was the only witness of fact in the VAT Tribunal proceedings, and he was both cross-examined and disbelieved by the Tribunal in its Decision, the Tribunal finding that Mr Potiwal had knowledge of the VAT evasion.
Briggs J, as he then was, held that Mr Potiwal and Red 12 were clearly privies in the context of the proceedings before the VAT Tribunal, even though he was neither asserting a personal claim of his own, nor was he exposed to personal liability for costs in the event (as occurred) that the appeal failed: see at [17]. However, Briggs J found the question whether the Secretary of State has the requisite privity of interest with HMRC to be a more difficult question. Whilst both are (or represent) government departments, and both were funded by the public purse (that is, the taxpayer), they exercise different functions, and HMRC could not of its own motion share information with other government departments: at [18] – [19]. In the end, Briggs J held that:
After some hesitation I have concluded that, despite the substantial overlap in interest between HMRC and the Secretary of State in relation to the issue as to Mr Potiwal's knowledge, it is not quite sufficient to make them privies. My reasons follow. First, the question is whether the degree of identification of interest makes it just for the one to be bound by the outcome of proceedings about that issue involving the other, and bound regardless which way that outcome goes. The effect of identification of two parties as privies is automatic, and gives rise to an estoppel which prevents the dispute or the issue being revisited, regardless of the circumstances of the first trial, and of the outcome. It is precisely because those consequences are automatic and potentially far-reaching that the law should in my view be slow to recognise privity of interest between different persons. As Megarry VC put it in Gleeson v Wippell :
‘The doctrine of privity for these purposes is somewhat narrow.’
Secondly, the modern tendency, exemplified by Johnson v Gore Wood , is to treat the res judicata principle as an aspect of the law of abuse of process. Thus, whereas it used to be thought that a situation to which the rule in Henderson v Henderson applied automatically barred the pursuit of a matter which could have been pursued in earlier proceedings, the modern rule is only that it may do so, if in all the circumstances it would be an abuse. I consider that it would therefore go against the grain of the development of the law about abuse of process to identify for the first time a new class of privity of interest between two very different arms of government pursuing different aspects of the public interest, and being motivated in particular cases by different policy and funding considerations when doing so.
The result is that the first way in which the Secretary of State puts his case on this application fails. Although there was privity of interest between Mr Potiwal and Red 12 on the question as to his knowledge of the VAT fraud in which his company participated, there is no estoppel binding him because of the absence of the requisite privity of interest between HMRC and the Secretary of State in relation to that issue.”
However, Briggs J held that to permit the issue as to Mr Potiwal’s knowledge to be relitigated would be to bring the administration of justice into disrepute, in the eyes of right-thinking people: at [28]. Accordingly, Mr Potiwal’s evidence was struck out as an abuse of process, and not on the ground of estoppel per rem judicatam. But again, the facts of that case are quite different from the present one.
The next decision is that of the Court of Appeal, PSV 1982 Ltd v Langdon [2022] EWCA Civ 1319. The Court of Appeal there held that where a company's liability for a debt had been established by a court, and the debt had been incurred at a time when a director of the company was in breach of the Insolvency Act 1986 s.216, then s.217 operated to make the director automatically personally liable for that debt. The judgment creditor did not have to bring separate proceedings to prove the debt against the director. S. 217(3)(a) provided that a person who was involved in the management of a company known by a prohibited name in contravention of s. 216 was “personally responsible for all the relevant debts of a company”.
The case turns on the wording of the statutory provisions, rather than the ambit of the rule in Hollington v Hewthorn. This is readily apparent from the judgment of Asplin LJ (who gave the only reasoned judgment) at [42]:
It also seems to me that no question of binding a stranger by a judgment to which he was not a party arises and the rule in Hollington v Hewthorn as explained in Ward v Savill has no application. The section itself provides that the director (in this case) becomes liable for the relevant debts of the company. In this case, there is no dispute that the judgment in the Commercial Court Proceedings and the Consequential Orders were binding as against DYGL. The only question is how to determine what that relevant debt is for the purposes of enforcing the remedy provided by sections 217(1) and (2) against Mr Langdon. In this case, Teare J's order dated 19 December 2019 provided that judgment had been entered against DYGL for certain sums and that it was liable to indemnify the first claimant in respect of reasonable costs. The amount of those costs was the subject of a subsequent consent order. The Consequential Orders create the judgment debt against DYGL. They are the source of that debt. They speak for themselves. It is explained at para 43-02 of Phipson on Evidence(19th ed) that:
""Judgments being public transaction of a solemn nature are presumed to be faithfully recorded. Every judgment is, therefore, conclusive evidence for or against all persons (whether parties, privies or strangers) of its own existence, date and legal effect, as distinguished from the accuracy of the decision rendered. In other words, the law attributes unerring verity to the substantive, as opposed to the judicial portions of the record.""
There is no need to look to Teare J's findings of fact or reasoning against DYGL in order to establish DYGL's liability. Nor is one concerned with the legal consequences of those findings. Until they are set aside whether by appeal or by other procedural means, the Consequential Orders are proof of the debt. It is no surprise that this is the way in which the matter was pleaded against Mr Langdon.”
Thus, it was s. 217 itself which creates the liability on the part of the director for debts of the company, regardless of whether the existence and extent of those debts was established in previous litigation, and even though the director was not party to that earlier litigation and was not a privy of the company (as the Court of Appeal recorded at [2], picking up a finding of the first instance judge).
Another case, Mark John Wilson (in his capacity as Liquidator of E-Tel (UK) Limited (In Liquidation) v Nemish Mehta [2023] EWHC 1214 (Ch), a decision of ICC Judge Jones, says, following Secretary of State v Potiwal, that it would be an abuse of process to allow a director to relitigate matters already decided against him in separate tribunal proceedings. This was not a reserved judgment, and it was decided without any participation from the defendant (who had asked for an adjournment, which had been refused).
The recent decision in Hyde v Todd [2024] EWHC 1423 (Ch) went the other way. There, the liquidators brought a claim against directors pursuant to s. 214 of the Insolvency Act 1986 (wrongful trading), and sought to rely in a summary judgment application on findings made in previous proceedings in the First Tier Tribunal (Tax). At first instance, Chief ICC Judge Briggs dismissed the application for summary judgment. The appeal against his decision was dismissed by Edwin Johnson J. The appellant liquidators’ claim relied heavily upon findings made by the Tribunal, in particular, upon findings made by the Tribunal as to the respondent directors’ knowledge, going back to 2006, that the transactions in which the company was engaged were connected with the fraudulent evasion of VAT. However, the liquidators had not been party to the proceedings in the Tribunal. It was not argued by the liquidators that the respondent director qualified as a privy of the company, and thus was formally bound by the Tribunal’s decision.
Edwin Johnson J gave two reasons for dismissing the appeal. The first was that a claim under s. 214 was acutely fact sensitive and raised factual issues which were not suitable to determination on a summary basis: see at [63] – [66]. The second was that reliance on the findings in the FTT Decision was “at first sight” precluded by the rule in Hollington v Hewthorn: at [76]. The appellants sought to get around this by reference to Secretary of State v Potiwal, and Wilson v Mehta, to which I have referred above. The appellants contended that the case was on all fours with Potiwal and Mehta, and just as it would have been an abuse in those cases to permit the respondent to relitigate the issue of his knowledge of the relevant VAT fraud, so it would be an abuse for the respondent to relitigate the issue of his knowledge of the VAT fraud in the present case: at [87]. Edwin Johnson J held that while “there may be very considerable merit in this argument” and that, at trial, the appellants would be able to say that they are entitled to rely upon the Tribunal Decision, there were two problems with making a summary determination of the question whether the appellants could so rely, as follows. The first problem related to the first reason for dismissing the appeal, namely that the s. 214 claim raised issues, relating to the respondents’ state of mind, which had not been not before the Tribunal: see at [89] – [90].
The second problem, and more important reason for present purposes, was the “more fundamental question of whether the Appellants can rely upon the findings of the FTT Decision”. The Judge held that it was not appropriate to decide that on a summary basis. This was a question of whether there was an abuse of process. In a passage that is worth quoting, the Judge said this:
As can be seen, the question of whether, in cases of this kind, there is an abuse of process involves a fact sensitive inquiry, requiring an intense focus on the facts of the particular case and, turning specifically to the present case, a focus upon the thoroughness and fairness of the way in which the issue as to the Respondent's knowledge of the underlying VAT fraud was conducted by the FTT. I would add to this, in the present case, the requirement for an intense focus upon the overlap or lack of overlap between (i) the findings made by the FTT as to the Respondent's knowledge of the VAT fraud and (ii) the issues as to the Respondent's knowledge and state of mind which are relevant in the Section 214 Claim. The Appellants say that the position is clear, and can be seen to be clear at this stage. I do not accept this. In my view the question of whether there is an abuse of process or unfairness or the bringing of the administration of justice into disrepute in the present case, of a kind which was found in Potiwal and Mehta, is for trial. There may be other cases, involving an issue of this kind, where the position is clear and can be seen to be clear at the summary judgment stage. In my view, and by reference to the arguments and evidence in the present case, the present case is not such a case. I add that the position seems to me to be much the same in relation to the Company's decision not to challenge the findings of fact made by the FTT.”
Finally, in terms of the authorities cited to me, Counsel for Mr Maunder-Taylor took me to Wenman v Mackenzie (1855) 5 El & Bl 447. The facts are complicated, but I did not find this case of much assistance. It seems to me to be authority for the proposition that a judgment against a tenant does not bind a reversioner, or, as Counsel put, the latter is not a privy of the former. That is not this case. Triplark claims to be entitled to rely on the McGrath Judgement and Order, and the Tribunal Decisions, as a successor trustee, and not as freeholder.
In summary, I am concerned on Triplark’s summary judgment application with whether Mr Maunder-Taylor has a real (as opposed to fanciful prospect) of successfully defending the claim against him. As I understood Counsel for Triplark, Triplark is not saying that it can rely on a res judicata estoppel against Mr Maunder-Taylor, perhaps for the reason that “estoppels must be mutual”. Further, Triplark is not, on its summary judgment application, claiming that it is entitled to judgment on the basis of abuse of process. That is a separate claim, which is pursued by way of Triplark’s separate strike out application, on which I have not heard submissions.
I can see the force in Triplark’s case that the McGrath Judgment and Order and the decisions of the FTT and the Upper Tribunal necessarily mean that Mr Maunder-Taylor has been held to be in breach of trust, and that Triplark as the “successor trustee” is entitled to rely on those findings. However, notwithstanding the persuasive way in which the case was put, it did not seem to me that the authorities relied on by Triplark necessarily led to the conclusion that it was entitled to summary judgment. I have come to the clear conclusion that the issues raised in the applications are not suitable for summary disposal, and that the matter ought to be determined at trial. My reasons are as follows:
When Triplarks says that the McGrath Order is evidence on which it is entitled to rely, one must be careful as to what it is evidence of. It seems to me that Mr Maunder-Taylor is entitled to argue that the Order is not evidence of breach of trust, or that (even if it is), Mr Maunder-Taylor remains entitled to invoke s. 61 of the Trustee Act and / or arguments that some at least of the leaseholders acquiesced in what would otherwise have been a breach of trust, or are estopped from claiming against him (whether via Triplark or otherwise). As I understand it, at no stage in the proceedings which led to the McGrath Judgment and McGrath Order was it alleged that Mr Maunder-Taylor was in breach of trust. What was sought in the Consolidated Action was recovery of service charges as mistakenly paid, damages for breach of the Mr Maunder-Taylor’s obligation (as manager) to provide central heating, an injunction requiring Mr Maunder-Taylor to re-provide central heating, and a permanent injunction to prevent Mr Maunder-Taylor from cutting off the hot water supply. In those circumstances, there is force in Mr Maunder-Taylor’s submission that he has had no proper opportunity to raise arguments based on s. 61. Consideration of s. 61 is inevitably highly fact based and will rarely be appropriate for summary determination.
I derive further support for my conclusion that the matter is not suitable for summary judgment because the McGrath Order has been explicitly said not to be an order in rem. Triplark’s position when it was defendant in the recent 27A Application, which culminated in the decision dated 24 May 2024, was that it was “not open to the Tribunal to simply apply the findings and consequences of the McGrath Order to non-parties in the proceedings”. I accept of course that Mr Maunder-Taylor was a party to the McGrath Order. That is certainly a point of distinction. However, Triplark was not a party in the Consolidated Action which led to the McGrath Order. In those circumstances, where Triplark is saying (and the court agreed) that Triplark was not bound by the findings in the Consolidated Action there is at least a degree of tension in Triplark now saying in these proceedings that it is entitled to rely summarily on those findings and consequences made in the Consolidated Action as against Mr Maunder-Taylor.
Similarly, the Upper Tribunal stressed that its decision did “not have any effect on the rights of Triplark”: at [61]. Yet, Triplark asserts that it can rely on the findings as against Mr Maunder-Taylor.
In summary, the effect of the various decisions, and Triplark’s ability to rely on them, raise questions of real legal difficulty. The right forum to resolve those issues is at trial.
I also make it clear that I do not accept Mr Maunder-Taylor’s submission that a strike out order should be entered in his favour, as against Triplark. Mr Maunder-Taylor invites me to find that the findings in and outcome of the McGrath Judgment and Order and the Tribunal Decisions are inadmissible in these proceedings. That too is a matter for trial.
Conclusion
It follows that I will dismiss both Triplark’s application for summary judgment and Mr Maunder-Taylor’s counter-application. I will hear from the parties as to what should happen to Triplark’s application for strike out, although my initial view is that given the proximity of the upcoming trial the application should be adjourned to trial. It will be open to Triplark to submit at trial that, even if Triplark cannot directly rely on the earlier judgment and decisions, it would be an abuse of process for Mr Maunder-Taylor to be allowed to re-argue points which went against him at the earlier hearings.
I will hear from Counsel as to what other consequential orders I should be making at this stage.

Lord Justice Dingemans:
Introduction and grounds of appeal
This is the judgment of the Court, to which we have all contributed.  This is the hearing: of appeals against convictions for conspiracy to murder on the part of Mr Oni, Mr Ojo and Mr Jitoboh; and of appeals against convictions for conspiracy to cause grievous bodily harm with intent on the part of Mr Thomas (Junior) Mr Adedeji, Mr Savi and Mr Okoya.  It is also the hearing of appeals against sentence on the part of Mr Adedeji, Mr Savi and Mr Okoya.  The conspiracies were alleged to have occurred between 4 November 2020 and 6 February 2021.
On 31 July 2024 the full court, having heard applications for leave to appeal against conviction and sentence and various extensions of time on 12 July 2024, gave judgment [2024] EWCA Crim 893, and granted leave to appeal against conviction to all the appellants on specific grounds that gave rise to the following issues, being whether: (1) the approach to the law of conspiracy by the judge was wrong; (2) the judge’s direction on the use of the guilty pleas of the appellants Mr Oni and Mr Ojo to count 2 was wrong; and (3) the judge misdirected the jury on section 34 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act.  These three issues were common to all the conviction appeals.
There were further grounds giving rise to issues on which leave to appeal against conviction was granted to Mr Adedeji and Mr Okoya only.  These were: (4) the judge was wrong to admit the photograph of the appellants Mr Adedeji and Mr Okoya with cash by the ear (sometimes referred to as “the money phone”); (5) the summing up by the judge of the photograph showing cash by the ear in relation to Mr Adedeji was wrong; and (6) the identification evidence by PC McGregor of the appellant Mr Adedeji wearing a blue bandana in a photograph was wrongly admitted, or was now shown to be wrong in the light of fresh evidence.  In the last respect Mr Adedeji was granted permission to apply to adduce as fresh evidence on the appeal the witness statements of Mr Tyrone Numa and Mr Ian McMeekin, the latter of whom was junior counsel for Mr Adedeji at the trial.  Both Mr Numa and Mr McMeekin gave evidence at the hearing of the appeal and were cross-examined on behalf of the prosecution.
By the end of the hearing it was apparent that there was a further issue to be determined, namely: (7) in the event that any of the convictions were quashed, whether a retrial should be ordered.
Leave having been granted for an appeal against sentence, there was a further issue, being (8) whether the sentences for Mr Adedeji, Mr Savi and Mr Okuna were wrong in principle or manifestly excessive.
The full court had refused extensions of time, leave to appeal in respect of all the other grounds of appeal against conviction, and leave to rely on other fresh evidence, for the reasons set out in the judgment [2024] EWCA Crim 893.
With two exceptions, the appellants were represented on the appeal by counsel who had not appeared at the trial below.  The parties each prepared helpful written submissions, and at the hearing of the appeal oral submissions were made by: Mr Monteith KC and Ms Mogan on behalf of Mr Adedeji; Mr Green KC and Ms Kramo on behalf of Mr Oni; Mr Newton KC and Ms Webb on behalf of Mr Ojo; Mr Abraham on behalf of Mr Jitoboh; Ms Piercy and Ms Papamichael on behalf of Mr Thomas (Junior); Mr Temkin KC and Mr Palmer (who were trial counsel) on behalf of Mr Savi; Mr Kane KC and Mr Gray (who were trial counsel) on behalf of Mr Okoya; and Mr Sandiford KC and Mr Smith (who were trial counsel) on behalf of the prosecution.  We also received written submissions from Dr Okewale and Mr Mosley on behalf of Justice, intervening in the appeal of Mr Adedeji, raising issues about racial stereotyping adultification of black and ethnic minority defendants, and the misinterpretation of drill music as evidence of criminal activity.
We were very grateful to counsel and their legal teams for their co-operation with each other in preparing for the appeal, and for their agreement of timetables for the hearing of the appeal, and for all of the assistance provided to the court.
Reporting restrictions
Reporting restrictions were imposed on the judgment dated 31 July 2024 [2024] EWCA Crim 893, and on the hearing of this appeal.  This was because if any of the appeals against conviction had been allowed, the court might have ordered a retrial, and it was necessary to avoid the risk of prejudice to any fair retrial arising from what was said in the judgment or at the hearing of the appeal.  We now lift those reporting restrictions because there will be no retrials.  This is in circumstances where, for the detailed reasons given below, we have dismissed the appeals against conviction for all of the appellants save Mr Adedeji, whose appeal against conviction is allowed in the light of fresh evidence going to the issue of his identification on a video clip.  We have allowed the appeals against sentence of Mr Savi and Mr Okoya.
Pleas and convictions
Mr Oni, Mr Jitoboh, Mr Thomas (Junior), together with a co-defendant Simon Thorne, pleaded guilty before trial to the offence of violent disorder which occurred on 5 November 2020 around 7 pm in Birchenhall Street, Moston.  Mr Oni and Mr Ojo pleaded guilty before trial to the count of conspiracy to cause grievous bodily harm with intent.
Mr Oni, Mr Ojo and Mr Jitoboh were found guilty of conspiracy to murder, together with a co-defendant (Gideon Kalumda), on 17 May 2021 after a trial before Goose J and a jury which lasted some 10 weeks.  Mr Thomas (Junior), Mr Adedeji, Mr Savi and Mr Okoya, together with other co-defendants ( Simon Thorne and Azim Okunola), were found guilty after trial on the same date, of conspiracy to cause grievous bodily harm with intent.
The appellants before this court, in the order in which they appeared on the indictment and with their ages at the time of sentencing and at the time of the offences are: (1) Harry Oni, 15/5/03 - 19 years (17 years at time of offences) no previous convictions but two cautions for possession of a knife and possession of cannabis on 15 November 2019; (2) Jeffrey Ojo, 27/1/01 - 21 years (19 years at time of offence) no previous convictions; (3) Brooklyn Jitoboh, 30/8/03 – 18 years (17 years at time of offences) no previous convictions; (4) Martin Thomas (Junior), 14/2/03 - 19 years (17 at time of offences) a previous conviction of possession with intent to supply Class A drugs; (5) Ademola Adedeji, 1/6/03 - 19 years (17 years at time of offence) no previous convictions; (6) Raymond Savi, 27/1/03 - 19 years (17 years at time of offence) no previous convictions; and (7) Omolade Okoya, 24/2/03 - 19 years (17 years at time of offence) no previous convictions.
The relevant factual background to the offences
This summary is based on: the findings of fact set out in sentencing remarks by the judge, who had heard a trial over some 10 weeks; extracts from the agreed facts at trial; and an extract of some messages taken from a telegram social media chat.
The judge found that the background to the offences lay in a rival gang culture between two gangs.  Complaint was made on the applications for leave to appeal against conviction, and again on the appeal, about the use of the word gang.  It is obviously important in any case to ensure that separate individuals are not unfairly treated as one entity, and that groups of friends or individuals sharing an interest in music are not unfairly labelled as gangs.  It is clearly necessary to consider whether bad character evidence of gang membership is relevant to a particular individual’s case, see generally R v Alimi [2014] EWCA Crim 2412.
There are, however, two answers to the general complaint about references to the gang on this appeal.  The first is that in the agreed facts, being facts agreed by the prosecution and each defendant to be true, the M40 gang and the RTD gang, were described as gangs.  The second is that, on the relevant facts, there could not be any doubt that two gangs, namely the M40 gang from the Moston area of north Manchester, and the RTD gang from Rochdale and Oldham, were engaged in a rivalry which led on 5 November 2020 to the stabbing of Joseph Raji, a person identified with the RTD gang, in central Manchester, and the murder of John Soyoye, a member of the M40 gang who had taken part in the attack on Mr Raji.  The judge found that in this case the rivalry between the gangs manifested itself on social media and through drill rap music, with threats of violence, the display of weapons, including firearms, machetes and crossbows. It is apparent that many of the lyrics in the rap music picked up actual events which had occurred during the course of the rivalry, as appears from the prosecution case relating to Mr Oni.  The judge said that entering the territory of one gang or group was treated as provocation, to be met by violence or the threat of violence.
The fact that the gangs existed did not, however, mean that each defendant was a member of the gang, or that each member of the gang carried out the actions or shared the same responsibility for any actions which were carried out by other members of the gang.
On the 5 November 2020 at 2.40 pm in the afternoon a group of young men, including Mr Oni, Mr Jitoboh, Mr Thomas (Junior) and Mr John Soyoye, also known as MD, chased down and attacked Mr Raji, a member of the RTD gang in Manchester city centre, in Piccadilly Gardens. The RTD gang member was kicked, punched and stabbed whilst on the ground. It was a very public display of serious group violence captured on CCTV and observed by frightened members of the public.
The agreed facts at the trial summarised those events as follows:
“At approximately 14:40 hours members of the M40 gang attacked Joseph Raji as he stood with a group of males, including Christopher Semedo and Mohammed Al-Jaf, in Piccadilly Gardens, Manchester. Harry Oni, Brooklyn Jitoboh, Martin Junior Thomas, Simon Thorne and Alexander John Soyoye were all present at the time. Nobody was arrested or charged in relation to this incident. Joseph Raji was taken to the ground where he was punched, kicked and stamped and stabbed to the leg before onlookers intervened and the attackers made off.  As Alexander John Soyoye walked away he was captured on CCTV footage filming the attack on his mobile telephone. Joseph Raji was taken to Manchester Royal Infirmary where he was treated for a deep one to two inch stab wound to the inside of his right thigh.”
It was also agreed that: “Following the attack in Piccadilly Gardens there was communication between members of the two rival gangs, which led to a violent meeting when twenty one [21] armed males met in Moston later that evening.”  It is a tragedy that in this case otherwise sensible children (as the evidence showed that most were – though they are now adults in prison), who had many talents and the potential to become useful members of society, decided that arranging a violent confrontation was a sensible way to act towards each other.
The judge recorded that later that evening further events of violent disorder occurred. At about 6pm, 13 men with knives, machetes and other weapons travelled to Moston Lane, Moston. They were associated with the RTD gang and were seeking violent revenge for what had happened earlier. They were searching for the M40 gang. Eight of the M40 gang, including Mr Jitoboh, Mr Thorne, Mr Thomas (Junior), Mr Samedo and Mr Oni as well as Mr John Soyoye (who was aged just 16 years at the time), prepared themselves for the fight with machetes, sticks and poles.
The two groups came together. Mr Soyoye openly carried a machete, as did another unidentified youth. Mr Oni, Mr Jitoboh, Mr Thorne and Mr Thomas (Junior) carried either long poles or a baseball bat. Mr Samedo had no weapon at the start, but was carrying one later. All were prepared for a fight with weapons. All weapons were visible in their hands. The CCTV recording of what happened was seen by the court during the trial.
When they realised that they were outnumbered by the RTD gang, the M40 gang ran, but Mr John Soyoye was caught and attacked with machetes. He received 15 separate stab wounds and died at the scene. As already partly noted, Mr Jitoboh, Mr Thorne, Mr Thomas (Junior), Mr Samedo and Mr Oni subsequently pleaded guilty to the offence of Violent Disorder arising out of that conflict.
In a subsequent trial before a different jury, seven of those 13 men of the RTD gang or group were convicted of the murder of Mr Soyoye and one was convicted of his manslaughter.  Sentences of life imprisonment were imposed.
The judge, in sentencing the appellants, stated that the prosecution case, accepted by the jury, was that after Mr Soyoye’s murder on the 5 November 2020, ten persons formed a criminal agreement or conspiracy, in which the defendants decided that one or more of them would attack the rival gang or group. The jury found that four of them (being Mr Oni, Mr Ojo, Mr Kalumda and Mr Jitoboh) intended that they would kill a member of the RTD gang.  The jury found that the others (being Mr Thorne, Mr Thomas (Junior), Mr Adedeji, Mr Savi, Mr Okoya and Mr Okunola) intended that grievous bodily harm would be caused.
The judge was sure that the conspiracy was formed quickly, within days after the murder of Mr John Soyoye. In a Telegram social media chat on the 8 November 2020, the judge found that seven individuals were exchanging ideas in planning, identifying where the targets could be found and who might be threatened to disclose information about the targets. The judge found that the Telegram social media chat was clear evidence of the conspiracy in action and not just its formation.  The discussion quickly turned to the issue of revenge by ‘touching’ (stabbing) members of the rival gang or group responsible for the murder of Mr Soyoye. From this it could properly be deduced that those invited to participate in the chat were trusted members or associates of the M40 gang or group. Seven potential targets for attack were identified by name - the participants exchanged information about where those targets could be located and attacked - the participants discussed an attack on a person called Jair (Ismael Correia) which had been arranged later on the afternoon of 7 November 2020.  The participants discussed kidnapping Jair and forcing him to reveal the whereabouts of others that the gang or group wished to attack.  The participants discussed the use of violence, bribery and blackmail against young female associates of their intended targets to force those females to provide information about the whereabouts of those targets and ensure the said females did not go to the police.
So far as Mr Adedeji is concerned, he joined the Telegram chat, using the pseudonym of “Shay Mya” and was known to others as ‘Stormzy’. The judge found that he did not express any surprise or concern about being invited to or participating in a discussion, the focus of which was seeking out and attacking and stabbing those believed to be responsible for the murder of Mr Soyoye.
What is clear is that Mr Adedeji: (i) did reveal and share his accurate knowledge that one of those responsible for the murder of Mr John Soyoye lived on Lime Side Street, Oldham and that was where most of them were based; (ii) a short time later provided a postcode for the address that he had obtained in a separate chat from a female associate informing his co-conspirators that there was “drop there” (a location where one of their intended targets could be found and attacked); and (iii) enquired about another target of the conspirators called Khalid, asking where he lived. There was evidence at the trial, including from Mr Adedeji’s interview under caution, showing that the word “touch” was a euphemism for stab.
We have considered carefully the Telegram chat messages.  These are of particular significance in circumstances where Mr Savi was convicted apparently solely on the basis of those messages. Like Mr Adedeji he was of previous good character, and he was a talented sportsman, attended Church, and had aspiration to attend university. The evidence suggested that Mr Adedeji, Mr Okoya and Mr Okonula were close to each other, but not particularly close to Mr Oni, Mr Ojo or to the others.
A summary of relevant events from the Telegram chat is set out below:
“12:57:50 [Group chat created by Ojo - all participants invited to join via link]

Discussion turns to kidnapping him
13:36:46 Savi Make sure to take his phone so he can’t contact them man
Further discussion of bringing rope and t-shirts” (emphasis added)
It is apparent from those extracts from the chat that there was discussion about touching (stabbing) those believed to have been involved in the murder of John Soyoye, who was referred to as MD.  There was discussion about the fact that MD would have done something by now if anyone else had been stabbed.  It is apparent that there were locations shared where those who were believed to have been involved in the murder of John Soyoye lived, and that there were discussions about getting more information from girls who knew those believed to have been involved in the murder of John Soyoye.
Some reliance was placed on matters not directly evidenced from the chat but apparent from it.  It was said that it was apparent from the Telegram chat that Mr Savi already knew about an arrangement to “sell” airpods to Jair, the person identified as the first target.
For both Mr Savi and Mr Adedeji there was in each case one additional chat relied on by the prosecution.  As far as Mr Adedeji was concerned there was a Snapchat with a person using the name Prince Abu on 7-8 November. It appears that Mr Adedeji had accused Prince Abu (referred to as PA below) of posting an offensive video about the death of Mr Soyoye. What followed was:
“PA: wtf man believe me I love Jon I am the last guy who would ever kill him if I would have knew that he died at that I wouldn’t have put that fucking video on it Mums jon is like a brother to me infackt like a father.” …
Adedeji: … Wait so it was not yiu that record the video? …
PA: I don’t have any contact with portages
Adedeji: Snm bless but I just fine you a weird person fo[cutoff] posting that can't lie and if I ever find out you post something like that again I am going to k[cutoff] you bro no cap so you best apologise.”
As far as Mr Savi was concerned Mr Savi was part of the same Telegram chat when it was revived on 14 November with some discussion initiated by Mr Okonula directed to “this guy… get him down ….I’ll give you 2k… make sure to strip him and record”, to which Mr Savi responded “who is he? What’s he saying?”
There was also evidence from the other defendants as to the contacts each of them had with Mr Savi and Mr Adedeji. This amounted to going to the same high school, seeing them at parties and so forth.
It is plain that the Telegram chat was a central part of the prosecution case against those whom the prosecution accepted were the lesser participants in the conspiracy such as Mr Adedeji and Mr Savi. The prosecution closing speech was principally based on what was said in that chat, what could be inferred from it as to previous exchanges, what those who participated must have understood from it, the fact that each used false names, and the apparent hopelessness of late suggestions by some of the defendants that there was a side chat mocking the Telegram chat, suggesting that the Telegram chat was not meant either literally or seriously. It is fair to say that the conviction of Mr Savi was solely on the basis of the Telegram chat.
So far as Mr Adedeji is concerned, the chat was identified by the prosecution as “most important”. There were some further matters to add to the Telegram chat. There was the “Prince Abu” Snapchat, relied on in closing by the prosecution as evidence that “Mr Adedeji was prepared to threaten to kill”. There were a number of matters relied upon as indicating membership of or affiliation with M40. There was the picture with cash to his ear, which forms the basis for one of the grounds of appeal.  There was his friendship with Mr Soyoye, who had been murdered giving Mr Adedeji a motive for revenge. There was the alleged identification in the video with the bandana which forms the basis for another of the grounds of appeal. There was an image on Mr Adedeji’s phone of John Soyoye in what was contended to be the M40 gang colours of blue. In particular reliance was placed on a photo which Mr Adedeji posted with a moving message of grief (“my heart’s broken in a million pieces….”), the point being that to accompany this important and personal message he had used not a front face view, but a rear view photo of John Soyoye in a MD40 t-shirt, and he had specifically cropped “most of the things out so it would just say MD40”.
The judge found that in pursuance of the conspiracies, three incidents of violence were carried out against some of those who were targeted.  These incidents of violence were carried out before either those who had joined the conspiracies could be arrested for their part in the conspiracies, or the targets of the conspiracies could be arrested for their part in the murder of John Soyoye. The judge was sure that these incidents were just the start of what was intended, because despite the violence that was used, the men identified in the Telegram chat as the prime targets, were not found or attacked before they were arrested by the police for their part in the murder of John Soyoye.
The three incidents were as follows.  First, on 10 November 2020 Mr Oni and Mr Ojo confronted Hellion Santos at Hopwood College. Mr Oni took with him a large knife, most likely a sword or machete in a sheath, which he revealed to Mr Santos. Mr Ojo was present as back up. Although Mr Oni denied that he had a bladed weapon, the judge was sure that he had one.  This was because it was around the time he was purchasing significant numbers of machetes online, within weeks he used a machete to attack another victim, and he was found in possession of a quantity of machetes on later arrest. In the event, Mr Santos managed to escape after being chased by both Mr Oni and Mr Ojo.
Secondly, on 16 December 2020 Mr Oni and Mr Kalumda travelled to the Freehold Flats area of Rochdale, to what they considered to be the territory of the RTD gang. Mr Oni took a machete again. This time Mr Oni caused serious injuries. The attack was captured on CCTV as both Mr Oni and Mr Kalumda chased after the victim. The victim was struck across his back several times, causing very deep and long slash type injuries. As the victim ran across the road to reach safety in a shop, Mr Oni struck him again across the back, in front of traffic. The judge was sure that, had Mr Oni not been disturbed by the traffic and the victim’s escape into the shop, his injuries would have been even more severe.  The judge found that Mr Oni’s intention was obvious, namely that it was to kill, as part of the conspiracy.
Thirdly, on 28 December 2020 four men, including Mr Kalumda, travelled in a stolen car, again to Freehold Flats in Rochdale. The driver remained in the car while the other three, including Mr Kalumda, chased another victim, who initially managed to escape. Mr Kalumda and the other two returned to the waiting car and went in search of the victim. When he was found, the same three with machetes got out of the car and ran after the victim who was brought to the ground and attacked in full view of a CCTV camera. Two of them, not Mr Kalumda, repeatedly struck the victim with their machetes, causing very serious slash injuries while he was on the ground.  Mr Kalumda stood close by with his machete in hand. They returned to the car leaving the victim on the pavement. The car was then used as a weapon in an attempt to drive over the victim whilst still lying on the ground. It was only because that man realised what was to happen, that he managed to get up and was thrown onto the bonnet of the car. The judge found that the intention of those men in that car was clear, it was to kill as part of the conspiracy
Some issues and rulings at trial
The prosecution case was that there were four key issues at trial being: (1) was the M40 a criminal gang or group involved in a real feud or just a music group; (2) were any of the defendants at trial a member, affiliate or supporter of the M40; (3) was there a conspiracy to take violent revenge on the rival gang or group with an intention to kill members of the rival gang or group (count 1) or to cause grievous bodily harm with intent to members of the rival gang or group (count 2); (4) if so, were any of the defendants a party to either of the agreements.
It is apparent that prosecuting and defence counsel at the trial co-operated (in accordance with their duties under the Criminal Procedure Rules) and agreed a number of matters at the trial including: (a) the admission of evidence, including ‘gang or group’ evidence and evidence of drill lyrics; (b) the admission of the evidence of PC McGregor; (c) other agreed facts under the Criminal Justice Act 1967; and (d) the directions of law given to the jury as appropriate to the issues and circumstances of this case.
One ruling related to an image found on Mr Adedeji’s phone showing him holding cash to his ear.  The judge ruled that the evidence was admissible for the following reasons.  First, the applicant denied gang or group membership.  Secondly, the image of holding a substantial amount of cash to the right ear in a similar way to other images of other gang or group members was potentially relevant to the issue of his membership of or affiliation with the M40 gang or group.  Thirdly, the judge did not conclude that the admission of the evidence reversed any burden of proof.  It was relevant evidence to a significant issue, namely whether Mr Adedeji was a member or affiliate of the M40 gang or group, some of whose members held cash in the same way to show the camera how much they had.
It was contended on behalf of Mr Adedeji that the prosecution suggested the money held to the ear by him had come from drug dealing and that Mr Adedeji’s evidence that the money had come from working in a shop had been accepted.  The prosecution referred to drug dealing during the closing speech.  It had been common ground that some of the defendants had been involved in drug dealing.  By reference to the cash to the ear photographs it was said: “you may think that the showing off cash in this case is again consistent with connections to the gang.”
The next ruling related to Mr Okoya and images extracted from Mr Okoya’s mobile telephone.  These were two images of the applicant with unknown youths making hand gestures; a screenshot of a news article about the arrests in the case; and a “selfie” photograph of the applicant holding a small fold of cash.
The judge ruled that the evidence challenged by Mr Okoya was admissible.  Mr Okoya did not admit gang membership or affiliation so it remained a significant issue for the jury to determine.  The images of the appellant in 2019, before the indictment period of the conspiracy, with unknown youths making hand gestures indicating the possession of or intention to use firearms, coupled with images of blue bandanas being worn by other unknown youths, provided relevant evidence of gang or group membership or affiliation by the applicant.  The screenshot of the news article of the arrest of six youths concerning the trial offences was also potentially relevant evidence of gang or group affiliation or membership.  It showed a clear interest by the applicant of their arrest.  The selfie image was also potentially relevant evidence of gang or group membership or affiliation.  It was not just the possession of cash but that it was a significant quantity of cash and was held in the hand to the right ear in a similar fashion to other members of the M40 gang or group.  Each of the images was therefore admissible.
Summing up
The judge summed up to the jury.  It is apparent that there were several drafts of the legal directions which the judge sent to the parties.  Submissions were made on behalf of Mr Jitoboh in relation to the draft direction on acts and declarations in the course of the conspiracy.  It is apparent from the written submissions that the objection related to the use being made of certain lyrics and whether those were within the time period for the conspiracy.
In the final event the directions were agreed by all counsel save with the exception of those acting on behalf of Mr Okoya in relation to the use to be made of the fact that Mr Oni and Mr Ojo had pleaded guilty to conspiracy to cause grievous bodily harm.  The jury had the judge’s legal directions in writing.  The judge directed the jury in relation to conspiracy in conventional terms.  The judge noted that a conspiracy is an agreement between two or more people to commit an intended crime by one or other of them and that such a conspiracy is itself a crime, separate from the intended crime. The offence is complete once the agreement is made.
The judge expressly recorded that defendants may join and leave a conspiracy at different times. The judge said that the defendants do not have to join it at the same time and they may play different parts in the conspiracy, and they do not necessarily need to know, meet or communicate with all of the other conspirators, but they must communicate with one or more to be a party to the conspiracy. The defendants do not have to know all the full details of the conspiracy, or exactly what each of the conspirators will do.
The judge distinguished between the two forms of conspiracy.  He directed that the difference between count 1 and count 2 was the purpose of the conspiracy, whether it was to kill someone, or it was to intentionally cause them grievous bodily harm.
In the directions the judge directed the jury: “To be guilty of Conspiracy to Murder (Count 1), the prosecution must prove:- (1) That there was an agreement between 2 or more of the defendants or others, that at least one of them would kill another person; (2) That the defendant, whose case you are considering, was a party to that agreement; and (3) He intended that the agreement be brought into effect.  To be guilty of Conspiracy to Cause Grievous Bodily Harm (Count 2), the prosecution must prove:-  (1) That there was an agreement between 2 or more of the defendants and/or others, that at least one of them would intentionally cause grievous bodily harm to another person; (2) That the defendant, whose case you are considering, was a party to that agreement; and (3) He intended that the agreement be brought into effect.”  The judge then directed the jury on intention to kill and cause grievous bodily harm with intent.
The judge directed the jury in relation to the pleas saying: “… so how are you to treat the guilty plea of Oni and Ojo to count 2? You do not decide that count in their cases because they have admitted, you will only consider count 1 for them: Are you sure that the conspiracy was to kill rather than only to cause grievous bodily harm? Further, the fact that Oni and Ojo have pleaded guilty to count 2 does not prove that any other defendant is guilty of either count on the indictment. You must not find any of those defendants guilty because of Oni and Ojo’s guilty plea to count 2.”
The judge continued: “What you may conclude, however, is that a conspiracy to cause grievous bodily harm existed and it included those two defendants, Oni and Ojo. It does not prove that there was a conspiracy to kill – count 1. Whether the conspiracy included any other defendant and whether it was to kill or only to cause grievous bodily harm is for you to decide on all of the evidence. If you conclude that both Oni and Ojo are guilty of count 1, the conspiracy to murder, then you will have rejected the evidence in their cases of the lesser alternative in count 2 and you will return verdicts of guilty on count 1 for them.  In those circumstances their guilty plea to conspiracy to cause grievous bodily harm will not be admissible evidence in the cases of the other defendants. It will be for you to decide on all of the other evidence if those defendants were a party to a conspiracy in count 1 or count 2, as I have directed you in Part 1 of my directions.”
The judge directed the jury about evidence of what was said or done by one defendant in a criminal conspiracy against another and said:
“Normally in a criminal trial, evidence of acts or statements of one defendant are only evidence against that defendant. They are only admissible against another defendant if it is adopted by that defendant, or they were present when it was done or said and showed that they adopted it. The reason for this is obvious: if a defendant was not present and did not adopt it, what was said or done cannot be admissible against him.
However, in a conspiracy to commit a criminal offence it is different. If you are sure that a criminal conspiracy existed and that the defendant, whose case you are considering, was a party to that conspiracy, then you may take into account what each of the conspirators said or did as being relevant evidence of the scope of the conspiracy, whether it was to kill or to intentionally cause grievous bodily harm. This is because what the conspirators do and say may be evidence of the conspiracy in action: it may prove what was agreed between the parties to the conspiracy.
An obvious example of the conspiracy in action, say the prosecution, are the acts of some of the defendants who used violence. Those acts are said to be part of the agreed crime to be committed, whether it was to kill or to intentionally cause grievous bodily harm. Whilst no-one was killed (which the defendants say means that it was not a conspiracy to kill), what was the intention of those who carried out the incidents, including the weapons used, the injuries caused and the attempt to drive over one of the men?
Another obvious example of the conspiracy in action, say the prosecution, are the things said in the Telegram and Snapchat group chats.”
The judge then concluded this part of the directions by turning to the lyrics, telling the jury that they had to exclude the possibility that they were unreliable as mere exaggeration, or were only reporting what others had said, or predated the conspiracy.
The judge gave agreed directions about the failure to mention facts in interview in relation to the applicants apart from Mr Adedeji. “Failing to mention facts in interview.  This direction does not apply to Adedeji because he answered police questions in his interviews, JB/12.  All of the other defendants either made no comment or answered some occasional questions but said little about their defence. Savi, Okoya and Okunola made no comment but provided a prepared statement denying any involvement in a criminal conspiracy.  The position of each defendant is set out within paragraphs 80-91 of the agreed facts in JB/2.  Therefore all of these defendants have given evidence in this trial and have relied on facts for their defence, none of which did they mention in their police interviews.  I repeat, Adedeji is excluded from this direction.”  The judge then directed the jury in conventional terms about drawing inferences which the jury considered fair and proper, considering whether the defendants could reasonably have been expected to mention what they had now said in evidence, and addressing the reasons advanced by the defendants for making no comment.  The judge did not identify the specific facts that any of the nine defendants to whom the direction applied had failed to mention.
The judge gave a direction which covered a number of images relating to a number of defendants about cash to the ear saying: “you have also seen mention and images of cannabis and cocaine, as well as large amounts of cash which you may think is evidence of drug dealing by some of the defendants.”
Sentencing
When sentencing the judge found that he was sure that, had it not been for the arrests carried out by the police, this conspiracy would have led to further incidents of very serious injury or killing.
When sentencing, the judge found that Mr Oni, Mr Ojo and Mr Kalumda played equal roles within the conspiracy to murder. Mr Oni and Mr Ojo clearly played the main role in the planning.  Mr Ojo set up the Telegram group chat, in which plans to carry out the violence were discussed.  Mr Oni and Mr Ojo drove the discussion. Mr Oni and Mr Ojo carried out the attack on 10 November 2020.  Mr Oni and Mr Kalumda carried out the attack on 16 December 2020.  Mr Kalumda also carried out the attack, with three others, on 28 December. Mr Oni and Mr Ojo each received an extended sentence of 21 years, comprised of a custodial term of 18 years and an extended licence period of 3 years.
Mr Jitoboh’s role in the conspiracy to murder was slightly less than for the others. He was part of planning targets for attack in the Snapchat conversation, which followed the Telegram chat, identifying the “main targets” the order in which they were to be attacked and how to bleach knife blades to clean them of evidence.  He received an extended sentence of 20 years, comprised of a custodial term of 17 years and an extended licence period of 3 years.
In respect of the conspiracy to cause grievous bodily harm with intent, the judge found that the co-defendants Mr Thorne, Mr Thomas (Junior), Mr Adedeji, Mr Savi, Mr Okoya and Mr Okunola each played a role of similar culpability. Those roles were to seek and acquire weapons, and to locate the targeted victims or to obtain the information necessary to locate them. The judge found that each of them played an important role in the conspiracy to cause grievous bodily harm with intent, which offence was carried out on two occasions and was attempted on another. The judge was sure that the weapons planned and used as part of the conspiracy, both in count 1 and count 2 were highly dangerous machetes, which were acquired for the purpose only of threatening and causing very serious injuries.
Mr Adedeji had no previous convictions or cautions.  The pre-sentence report described his progress in education and charity work.  The Court had been provided with a report from Dr Pearce, a Clinical Psychologist, a letter from Mr Adedeji and character references describing the good work which Mr Adedeji had done prior to the offence.  The judge found that Mr Adedeji’s involvement in the conspiracy was not confined just to the messages he sent on the Telegram chat; he supplied information to assist the process as a fellow-conspirator.  The jury found that he intended what he helped to plan and which happened.
Mr Savi had no previous convictions or cautions.  The pre-sentence report described his progress in education and in sports.  Letters of reference from Mr Savi’s family and college tutors were considered along with a letter from Mr Savi.  The judge found that Mr Savi’s involvement in the conspiracy was not confined just to the messages he sent in the Telegram chat because that was an open discussion about the obtaining of weapons and targeting a number of victims to cause them grievous bodily harm, and kidnapping.  Mr Savi supplied information to assist that process as a fellow-conspirator.  By the jury’s verdict, part of Mr Savi’s joint plan which was intended to be carried out actually occurred.
Mr Okoya had no previous convictions or cautions.  He had significant letters of reference from others who spoke of his good character.  His pre-sentence report was considered.  The judge found that by the jury’s verdicts, Mr Okoya was part of a joint plan intentionally to cause grievous bodily harm which was intended to be carried out and, in part, occurred causing very serious injury.
The assault guideline for offences of section 18 grievous bodily harm was the appropriate starting point.  The correct sentence category was 1A: the overt acts on 16 and 28 December involved “high culpability”, with a significant degree of planning and premeditation, the use of highly dangerous weapons and revenge violence.  There was Category 1 “harm” because particularly grave or life-threatening injury was intended.  The second of those incidents was a sustained attack with machetes and an attempt to drive over the victim as he lay on the ground.  The “harm” intended must be seen in the context of revenge after one of their friends had been murdered.
The starting point was twelve years with a range of ten to sixteen years.  There were two victims, the offence was further aggravated in its seriousness by the rise of criminality both in time and in those involved, so as to increase the custodial period to fifteen years.  Each was effectively of good character before the offence.  Whilst some had slightly stronger personal mitigation, the Judge was not persuaded that it created a significant difference between them.  The sentence was further reduced to eight years because of the appellants’ young age.  Each of the appellants convicted of causing conspiracy to cause grievous bodily harm with intent received a sentence of 8 year’s detention in a Young Offender Institution.
The approach to conspiracy and the pleas to counts two – issues one and two
The essential complaint at the heart of this appeal is that there was a failure at trial to confront the fact that there were in essence two separate agreements, one to kill and one to cause really serious bodily harm, giving rise to the separate conspiracies which were on the indictment.  The first was an agreement to murder members of the RTD gang, giving rise to a conspiracy to murder under count one, and the second was an agreement to inflict really serious bodily harm on members of the RTD gang giving rise to a conspiracy to cause grievous bodily harm with intent under count two.  It was submitted that although the judge had directed the jury about counts one and two, he had treated the two conspiracies as the same when giving directions and when sentencing the defendants.
Mr Monteith, on behalf of Mr Adedeji, in submissions adopted on behalf of other appellants, complained that the prosecution did not demonstrate two separate conspiracies with different intentions existed, that it was not possible to have one conspiracy with two separate intentions, and that the judge had been wrong to give the directions about words and actions of conspirators being attributable to other conspirators, because the evidence of the conspiracy to murder was inadmissible in relation to the conspiracy to commit grievous bodily harm.  Mr Kane, on behalf of Mr Okoya, in submissions adopted by other appellants, submitted that the directions given on the pleas of Mr Oni and Mr Ojo were wrong because the judge stated that the jury might conclude from the guilty pleas that “a conspiracy to cause grievous bodily harm existed, and it included” Mr Oni and Mr Ojo.  Although the judge had been persuaded, as a result of submissions made by Mr Kane at the trial, to direct the jury that if Mr Oni and Mr Ojo were convicted of conspiracy to murder their guilty pleas “will not be admissible evidence in the case of the other defendants” the damage had been done by the earlier directions.  Mr Kane complained that the prosecution’s approach was effectively alleging a conspiracy to “do bad things” which was not a conspiracy known to the law.  Mr Newton, on behalf of Mr Ojo, submitted that there was one agreement, which was count two.  The conspiracy to cause grievous bodily harm with intent encompassed the other relevant states of mind including those who joined with an intention to kill, and that the reality of the prosecution case was that there was an agreement to take revenge, the prosecution had not proved that all parties to the agreement had an intention to kill, and that the convictions for conspiracy to murder should have been for conspiracy to cause really serious bodily harm with intent.
Mr Sandiford, on behalf of the prosecution, submitted that there was an agreement by all of the appellants to take violent revenge for the murder of John Soyoye, and the defendants had joined the conspiracy with an intention to kill or an intention to cause really serious bodily harm.  Those who joined the conspiracy did not sit down and work out what sort of offence they were planning or would commit.  At the trial both Mr Oni and Mr Ojo wanted the jury to know that they had pleaded guilty to the conspiracy to cause grievous bodily harm with intent, because they contended that this represented the extent of their criminality.  It had been no one’s case that Mr Oni and Mr Ojo were not guilty of count two on the indictment.
Section 1 of the Criminal Law Act 1997 (CLA 1977) provides:
Subject to the following provisions of this Part of this Act, if a person agrees with any other person or persons that a course of conduct shall be pursued which, if the agreement is carried out in accordance with their intentions, either—
will necessarily amount to or involve the commission of any offence or offences by one or more of the parties to the agreement, or
would do so but for the existence of facts which render the commission of the offence or any of the offences impossible,
he is guilty of conspiracy to commit the offence or offences in question.”
Where liability for any offence may be incurred without knowledge on the part of the person committing it of any particular fact or circumstance necessary for the commission of the offence, a person shall nevertheless not be guilty of conspiracy to commit that offence by virtue of subsection (1) above unless he and at least one other party to the agreement intend or know that that fact or circumstance shall or will exist at the time when the conduct constituting the offence is to take place.
[...]
In this Part of this Act “offence”  means an offence triable in England and Wales [...]”
Section 1A of the CLA 1977 covers conspiracies to commit offences outside of England and Wales and section 2 covers exemptions from liability for conspiracy.
In the course of the written and oral submissions reference was made to Law Commission papers, to academic writing including Smith & Hogan and Professor JR Spencer, and to a number of authorities including: R v Barnard (1980) 70 Cr App R 28 (Barnard); R v Gray [1995] 2 Cr App R 100 (Gray); R v Roberts [1998] 1 Cr App R 441 (Robert); R v Crothers NICA [2000] 2158 CARC 3285 (Crothers); R v Saik [2006] UKHL 18; [2007] 1 AC 18 (Saik); R v Ahmed Ali [2011] EWCA Crim 1260; [2011] 2 Cr App R 22 (Ali); R v Mehta [2012] EWCA Crim 2824 (Mehta); and R v Shillam [2013] EWCA Crim 160 (Shillam).
In our judgment it is possible to identify a number of principles relevant to this appeal from the provisions of section 1 of the CLA 1977 and the authorities.  As is apparent from the wording of section 1 of the CLA 1977, it is an agreement that lies at the heart of conspiracy to commit an offence. Such an agreement need not have the formalities of a conventional contract, and the courts have warned against introducing into the straightforward concept of an agreement to pursue a course of conduct ideas that are derived from the civil law of contract.
It is not necessary in order to be guilty of conspiracy to commit an offence that anything should be done apart from the making of the agreement, so long as there is an intention to carry out the course of conduct which will necessarily amount to or involve the commission of any offence or offences, see Saik. It has been noted in the academic writings that conspirators may repent and stop, or may have no opportunity to commit the offence, or may fail to commit the offence but the crime is complete when the agreement with the necessary intention is made, as appears from section 1 of the CLA 1977.  Stopping participation in the conspiracy is only relevant to matters of sentence.
As was made clear in Mehta and Shillam a conspiracy requires that the parties to it have a common unlawful purpose or design. A common design means a shared design.  A common design is not the same as similar or parallel but separate designs.  The design must be unlawful, that is an agreement to commit an offence or offences.  It is possible to have what are sometimes called “wheel” or “chain” conspiracies, and it is not necessary for all the conspirators to meet either in person, or online.  An early reference to wheel and chain conspiracies was in R v Meyrick and Ribuffi (1930) 21 Cr App R 94 where Lord Hewart CJ observed at page 102 that it is: “necessary that the prosecution should establish, not indeed that the individuals were in direct communication with each other, or directly consulting together, but that they entered into an agreement with a common design. Such agreements may be made in various ways. There may be one person, to adopt the metaphor of counsel, round whom the rest revolve … There may be a conspiracy of another kind, where the metaphor would be rather that of a chain; A communicates with B, B with C, C with D, and so on to the end of the list of conspirators”.  The decision in Meyrick and Ribuffi long pre-dated the CLA 1977 but it remains the case that wheel or chain conspiracies can be committed, so long as there is a shared intention to carry out the course of conduct which will necessarily amount to or involve the commission of an offence or offences.
It is possible to indict a conspiracy comprising an intention to carry out a course of conduct which will necessarily involve the commission of a number of different offences, but unless two or more of the conspirators have agreed to commit all of those different offences, the count for conspiracy will fail, see propositions 4 and 5 in Roberts at page 449.  Roberts was a case where the count on the indictment was a conspiracy to cause criminal damage in the context of protests against live animal exports.  During the trial it was alleged that the defendants had carried out a campaign against exporters of live freight. This included an agreement to commit offences of criminal damage, criminal damage with intent to endanger life, criminal damage being reckless as to whether life would be endangered, and arson by damaging lorry tyres with nails, depositing oil on roads used by the lorries and carrying out a petrol bomb attack on lorries. Various complaints were made on appeal.  It was held that although it was permissible to charge a single count of conspiracy to cause criminal damage, such an approach was not appropriate in a conspiracy that involved different offences subject to different maximum penalties.  The approach in that case was held to be fatally flawed, although one conviction for conspiracy to cause criminal damage was safe in the light of a guilty plea.
For the offence of conspiracy to murder it is necessary to prove an intention to kill, see the obiter dicta to that effect in R v Siracusa (1990) 90 Cr App R 340 at 350 and Crothers.  It is therefore not sufficient to convict a person of conspiracy to murder to show that that person intended to cause really serious bodily harm, there must be an intention to kill, as for attempted murder.  It is, however, permissible to convict defendants of the lesser offence of conspiring to cause grievous bodily harm with intent when trying defendants for an offence of conspiracy to murder, see the Northern Ireland case of Crothers.  In Crothers Carswell LCJ accepted that a count alleging conspiracy to murder members of the RUC permitted the trial judge (sitting without a jury) to return a verdict of conspiracy to cause grievous bodily harm.  In that case there had been found by the trial judge only a conspiracy to cause grievous bodily harm.
As a matter of reality a conspiracy to cause grievous bodily harm can only be committed if there is an intention to cause grievous bodily harm, and so adding the words “with intent” at the end of the count on the indictment is tautologous, but it does have the benefit of underlining what is required to be proved.
Acts or statements made by co-conspirators in furtherance of a conspiracy are admissible against other conspirators “provided that it was proved that there was a conspiracy to which he was a party”, see Gray at pages 124-125.  This is because there is an implied authority to each conspirator to act or speak in furtherance of the common purpose on behalf of the others.  If there are two separate conspiracies what one person does in furtherance of that conspiracy is not admissible against another conspirator in respect of the second conspiracy, (again see Gray approving passages set out in the then current editions of Phipson on Evidence and Archbold).
Another case which highlighted the limitations of using acts and statements made by parties to separate conspiracies was Barnard.  Mr Barnard, a career burglar, held discussions with various other criminals about breaking into a jeweller’s shop and stealing the contents.  Mr Barnard had a way of working which involved gaining entry from the roof or ceiling of the jewellery shop and stealing the stock after hours.  After surveillance it became clear that the jeweller removed his stock each night and Mr Barnard gave up interest in the project.  The various other criminals decided to enter the shop during the day, use violence against the jeweller, and take the stock.  Those others and Mr Barnard were indicted for conspiracy to rob.  A count of conspiracy to steal was added to the indictment for Mr Barnard at the start of the trial, and he was convicted.  It was held that that conspiracy to steal was not a lesser form of conspiracy to rob, but was a different agreement.  In that case the safety of Mr Barnard’s conviction was undermined by the fact that the judge allowed the evidence of the robbery to be used as evidence against Mr Barnard, when it was a separate conspiracy.
It should be recorded that there have been criticisms of the breadth of the law of conspiracy, and it has been said that conspiracy charges have been regarded with suspicion by lawyers in England and Wales.  It seems that is in part because trials for conspiracy can be long and complicated, and the culpability of the individual defendants can vary greatly.  There are many advantages for both prosecution and defence in indicting substantive offences, rather than bringing an indictment for conspiracy, see Shillam at paragraph 25.  It is apparent, however, from the Encrochat cases that the law of conspiracy continues to serve a principled role in the prosecution of some criminal offending, particularly serious professional crime.
In the light of the principles set out above, in our judgment it is not permissible to prosecute as a single conspiracy an agreement to take violent revenge with either an intention to kill or to cause grievous bodily harm with intent.  They are in law two conspiracies, albeit with overlapping facts.  Thus in this case, one is a conspiracy by two or more defendants to pursue a course of conduct of taking violent revenge (which is the course of conduct for section 1) with the intention of killing those involved in the murder of John Soyoye (the intentions for section 1) which would necessarily amount to the offence or offences of murder (the offences for section 1(a)).  The other is a separate conspiracy to pursue a course of conduct of taking violent revenge (which is the course of conduct for section 1) with the intentions of causing grievous bodily harm to those involved in the murder of John Soyoye (the intentions for section 1) which would necessarily amount to the offence or offences of causing grievous bodily harm with intent (the offences for section 1(a)).
It is clear, however, that, in this case, the course of conduct for both of the separate conspiracies is the same, and what differs is the intention of those involved in the separate conspiracies. On the facts of this particular case it was therefore inevitable that those who were guilty of count 1 (the conspiracy to murder) were necessarily also guilty of count 2 (the conspiracy to cause grievous bodily harm with intent).  This is because, the course of conduct pursued by the defendants intending to kill those involved in the murder of John Soyoye (being those conspirators guilty of count 1 who were  Mr Oni, Mr Ojo and Mr Jitoboh) would inevitably have caused those involved in the murder of John Soyoye grievous bodily harm on the way to their deaths.  We note that in Crothers at page 123 it was said that the allegation that those conspirators intended to murder the officers included an allegation that they intended to inflict the lesser harm of grievous bodily harm upon them.
Whatever difficulties that there may be in establishing overlapping conspiracies on the facts of other cases, such as those addressed to us in submissions where persons intending to cause really serious bodily harm might not want to be associated with those intending to kill, they did not exist on the facts of this case.  It was apparent, from the Telegram chat at the least, that some who were party to the chat intended to kill those involved in the murder of John Soyoye, whereas others intended only to cause really serious bodily harm.
In these circumstances we do not consider that the final form of the indictment providing for two separate counts of conspiracy to murder (count 1) and conspiracy to cause really serious bodily harm with intent (count 2) was flawed or defective, or that trying all of the defendants on the two counts was impermissible.  The fact that there may be two overlapping but separate conspiracies is contemplated by the commentary by Professor JC Smith on Barnard in [1980] Crim LR 23, a commentary referred to by Professor Glanville Williams with apparent approval at footnote 6 on page 423 of the second edition of his Textbook on Criminal Law (1983).
For similar reasons we consider that the judge’s original formulation of his directions on the effect of Mr Oni and Mr Ojo’s pleas to count two was correct.  In those directions, part repeated in the final formulation, the judge told the jury that the pleas proved the existence of a conspiracy on count 2.  That meant that the judge’s directions on the pleas, after reflecting on the submissions from Mr Kane to the effect that if the jury convicted Mr Oni and Mr Ojo of count one (the conspiracy to murder) those pleas were not admissible evidence on count two, were wrong.  This is because in fact and law those pleas remained admissible evidence of the lesser conspiracy.  This does not, however, render the convictions unsafe.  This is because the final direction was too generous to those convicted of the conspiracy on count two.
That leaves only the question of whether the acts and declarations (or statements), of those convicted on count one could be taken into account as evidence against those convicted in relation to count two.  The evidence was properly admitted at trial because all of those involved in the conspiracy were tried together.  It is, however, a separate question as to whether the acts and statements of one conspirator is admissible to prove matters against another conspirator.
As appears from the extracts of the summing up above, the judge treated what were in law two separate conspiracies as one, and directed the jury that “you may take into account what each of the conspirators said or did as being relevant evidence of the scope of the conspiracy, whether it was to kill or to intentionally cause grievous bodily harm”.  That said it is apparent from the analysis set out above that those convicted of conspiracy to murder were, in the particular circumstances of this case, party also to the conspiracy to cause grievous bodily harm with intent.  Their acts and statements pursuing the conspiracy to cause grievous bodily harm with intent were admissible as evidence against their fellow conspirators, but their acts and statements in pursuing the separate conspiracy to murder were not admissible as evidence of, for example, the intention of those pursuing the separate conspiracy to cause really serious bodily harm with intent, compare Roberts.
As it was, and notwithstanding the efforts to kill made by those who were party to the conspiracy to murder, none of those involved in the murder of John Soyoye who were attacked were in fact killed, but they did suffer grievous bodily harm.  There were, however, statements, such as that made by Mr Ojo on a Snapchat message to “just start killing anyone” which identified Mr Ojo’s intention that those involved in the murder of Mr John Soyoye should be killed.  That was not a statement admissible as evidence of the intention of the other defendants who only intended that those involved in the murder of Mr John Soyoye should be caused grievous bodily harm, although a literal reading of the judge’s directions might suggest the contrary.
In this particular case, however, in our judgment the judge’s direction about admissibility of acts and declarations did not render the convictions unsafe.  First, this is because it is apparent from the jury’s verdicts that they could not have relied on, as against the other conspirators, what Mr Ojo implied as to his intention to kill.  This is because they did not convict all of the other conspirators of conspiracy to murder.  Secondly much of the other evidence was admissible against all of the defendants in relation to the conspiracy to cause grievous bodily harm with intent to which, for the reasons given above, all of the defendants must have been a party.  Thirdly all counsel agreed to the final version of the directions, and in our judgment that was a reasonable approach on the facts of this case.
We have considered the separate points made by Mr Abraham on behalf of Mr Jitoboh about factual inaccuracies made by the judge during the summing up of evidence relevant to Mr Jitoboh.  Mr Abraham submitted that, taken together, these were material and prejudicial to Mr Jitoboh, particularly given that there were two separate conspiracies. As noted above, those defendants who were party to the conspiracy to murder must, on the facts of this particular case, have been party to the separate conspiracy to cause really serious bodily harm with intent.  Further, again for the reasons given above, the jury could not have used the evidence of the intentions of those who intended to kill against the other conspirators, otherwise all of the defendants would have been convicted of conspiracy to murder.
It is apparent that the judge set out a fair summary of the prosecution and defence cases for each appellant, including Mr Jitoboh.  It does appear that the judge did make one error in relation to Mr Jitoboh, in referring to 7 November 2020 and not 7 December 2020, but the jury had the timeline where the correct date was set out, and the judge had made it clear to the jury that they were the judges of fact.  As it was, Mr Jitoboh’s visit on 7 December 2020 to the Freehold Flats in Rochdale together with Mr Ojo and Mr Thomas (Junior) was relevant and important evidence against Mr Jitoboh.  There was also video evidence showing Mr Jitoboh making another visit on 9 December 2020.  As to the complaints about the judge’s failure to emphasise other parts of evidence, we can see nothing in the judge’s approach to the evidence that would render the conviction of Mr Jitoboh unsafe.
For the detailed reasons set out above we are sure that the judge’s approach to the issue of conspiracy in this case, and the directions given by the judge on the guilty pleas of Mr Ojo and Mr Oni and the admissibility of evidence of what was said or done by one defendant, did not render any of the convictions unsafe.
Directions on failure to mention facts in interview – issue three
We turn to deal with the next ground, common to all of the appellants except Mr Adedeji who gave a full comment interview, which relates to section 34 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 (CJPOA 1994).
The judge gave agreed directions about the failure by the appellants (except Mr Adedeji) to mention facts in interview. However the judge did not identify the specific facts that any of the nine defendants to whom the direction applied had failed to mention.  The relevant directions are set out above under the heading “summing up”.
Mr Green, on behalf of Mr Oni, whose submissions on this issue were adopted by all of the other appellants apart from Mr Adedeji (who had been excluded from the direction), submitted that the judge’s failure to identify the facts which were not mentioned in interview denied the jury the opportunity properly to consider the particular facts and whether any failure was reasonable at the time.  Mr Sandiford, on behalf of the prosecution, submitted that for the judge to have listed for each defendant every fact not mentioned in interview would have resulted in “an encyclopaedic direction that would have been overly complicated and counterproductive”, and made the point that if the direction was inadequate at least one of the seventeen counsel for the nine defendants to whom it applied would have drawn it to the attention of the court.  Mr Sandiford referred to the judgment in R v Miah [2009] EWCA Crim 2368 (Miah) at paragraph 45.
Section 34 of the CJPOA 1994 permits the jury to draw such inferences as they think proper where an accused has, when interviewed, failed to mention a fact which in the circumstances he could reasonably have been expected to mention.  The section does not remove the right to silence, but the section encourages answers to be given in interview to avoid the inferences that might be drawn from a failure to mention facts that the accused could reasonably be expected to mention.  As was said in Miah at paragraph 41 “to identify what it is that the defendant relies on now but did not state is something which ought to be done so that the ambit of section 34 in a particular case can be made clear”. There seems to us to be little point in having section 34 of the CJPOA if the prosecution do not identify what facts they say the accused could reasonably have been expected to mention, and what inferences they say should be drawn.  In Miah the court was troubled by a similarly “compendious” section 34 direction but concluded that it had not damaged the appellant’s case or occasioned unfairness. The case of Miah is not authority for the proposition that the judge may give a direction which fails to specify the facts not mentioned by the relevant defendant.
We consider that in this particular case the judge should have required the prosecution to produce a list (agreed with the defence if possible) for each defendant of the facts that the prosecution submitted should reasonably have been mentioned in interview.  The matter should have been canvassed fully before closing submissions.  As was identified in the written and oral submissions, the relevant facts which had not been mentioned were not complicated or particularly lengthy. The prosecution should have been required to identify the inferences which the prosecution said should have been drawn from the failure to mention those facts.  It appears from the submissions, that the inferences to be drawn were that those facts were not true, and that the defendants had made them up after the event in an attempt to give them a defence at trial.  It should be remembered, however, that a failure to mention a fact which is admittedly true cannot found an adverse inference.
As indicated when the full court granted leave, this complaint alone is not sufficient to make the convictions unsafe.  This is in circumstances where on the facts of this case, if the relevant points had been identified, it would hardly have advantaged any of the defendants.  As it is, for the reasons given above, we consider that the directions should have been more extensive, but that does not undermine the safety of the convictions.
The admissibility of the cash by the ear photos – issue four
Photographs of Mr Adedeji and Mr Okoya showing them with cash to the ear (sometimes called the “moneyphone”) were admitted at trial.  As appears above (under the heading “rulings”) the judge ruled that the evidence was admissible because Mr Adedeji and Mr Okoya denied gang membership and the image of holding a substantial amount of cash to the right ear in a similar way to other images by other gang members was relevant to his membership or affiliation with the M40 gang.  The judge did not accept that admitting the photograph reversed any burden of proof.  The photographs were relevant evidence to a significant issue, namely whether the relevant defendants were a member or affiliate of the M40 gang, some of whose members held cash in the same way to show the camera how much they had.
It was submitted to us, partly in reliance on the submissions by Justice, that the photograph was part of an imitation of celebrity culture where similar “moneyphone” photographs had been taken, and that this was an example of racial stereotyping and adultification of young black children by showing them as part of a gang.
We agree with Mr Monteith that there should be reliable evidence that the action relied on to show gang membership (in this case the cash by the ear photograph) was evidence of the way that the relevant gang operated.  It is vital in any case to avoid the unfair stereotyping of individuals, based on their race, as members of gangs. In this case it was an agreed fact that there was a M40 gang, which was engaged in rivalry with the RTD gang.  Given the evidence in this case, it is not surprising that such formal admissions about the existence of the gangs in this particular case were made.
The way in which the existence of gangs may be proved at trials has been addressed in previous authorities which it is not necessary to set out and was not controversial before us.  One way in which the existence of gangs may be proved is for all the parties to agree it as a fact, as happened in this case.  It is an unfortunate and grim reality that children, in their immaturity, are sometimes persuaded to join gangs, and that some members of gangs believe that it is a grown up action to exclude other gangs from what they regard as their territory, and that some members of gangs believe violence against another gang is acceptable.  The terrible consequence of such actions evidenced in these appeals was the death of John Soyoye and the stabbing of some members of the RTD gang.
The question of whether Mr Adedeji or Mr Okoya were part of or affiliated in some way with the M40 gang involved in the rivalry with RTD was a relevant issue at trial.  There were photographs of alleged M40 gang members with cash to their ear.  The prosecution case was that this was part of the way in which individuals might be recognised as members of the M40 gang.  At the appeal it was common ground that some celebrities had had photographs showing them with cash by the ear, and it was submitted therefore that the photographs should not have been admitted by the judge.
In our judgment the judge was entitled to admit the photographs.  The  prosecution contended that the photographs were part of the way in which individuals might be recognised as members of the M40 gang, and they were entitled to adduce the evidence.  The fact that celebrities were photographed doing the same act, so as to make the gesture potentially one associated with celebrity culture, is not a complete answer.  This is because others may do the act in completely different circumstances.  For example if there was evidence that members of a particular gang saluted each other, and if there was an issue about whether a particular person was a member of the gang, it would be admissible evidence against that individual to show that he had saluted a member of the gang.  It would be no answer to the admissibility of the evidence to say that members of the Armed Forces salute each other.  If the relevant person gave evidence that he was simply imitating the actions of the Armed Forces that would be a matter to be assessed by the jury.  Similarly a gesture or phrase first associated with celebrity culture may be routinely used by a group as to associate with them.  All will depend on the facts.
The issue of whether the photographs were just an imitation of celebrity culture or an indication of membership of the M40 gang or group was before the jury, was fairly left to the jury by the judge, as appears for example from page 139B of the summing up.
Finally we should record that the judge’s direction on the relevance of gang membership was careful: “Are you sure the defendant whose case you are considering joined a conspiracy to murder or to cause grievous bodily harm? This evidence of gang membership, affiliation and of drug dealing cannot of itself prove the case against the defendants or any of them. Just because a defendant may be a member of the M40 gang or be affiliated with it and/or be involved in drug dealing does not alone mean that they are guilty. It is relevant to the background of these events. You should not, however, convict any defendant largely upon the basis of this background evidence.”
The judge’s directions in relation to the cash by the ear – issue five
In their closing speech the prosecution referred to drug dealing.  It had been common ground that some of the defendants had been involved in drug dealing.  Several of the defendants had admitted as much when they gave evidence.
The judge in the summing up said “At the heart of this trial is the allegation that each of the defendants was an M40 gang member or affiliate of the gang.  Part of the activities of some of the defendants was drill rap music and some involved in drug dealing.  You have read lyrics, heard drill rap and you have also seen mention and images of cannabis and cocaine, as well as large amounts of cash which you may think is evidence of drug dealing by some of the defendants.”
In our judgment this was a proper direction.  It was common ground that some of the defendants had been involved in drug dealing.  The judge did not say that all of the defendants were involved in drug dealing.  The judge followed it up with a direction that “you should not, however, convict any defendant largely upon the basis of this background evidence”.
The judge had also identified the relevance of the drill rap for the jury saying that interest in drill rap did not mean that any defendant was guilty of the offence, and that it was relied on because the prosecution said that the music was being used to threaten the RTD gang and because it contained admissions about what had been done.  The evidence given by some of the defendants that the lyrics were not to be taken seriously was also fairly put before the jury.  We can see nothing that would make the conviction unsafe on this ground.
The identification of Mr Adedeji by PC McGregor and the fresh evidence – issue six
On this issue we heard evidence from Mr McMeekin, junior counsel for Mr Adedeji at trial, and from Tyrone Numa.  Mr McMeekin’s evidence was principally to explain why Mr Numa had not been called at trial.  Mr Numa’s evidence was that he was the person depicted in the nine second video clip and not Mr Adedeji.  Both Mr McMeekin and Mr Numa were cross examined by Mr Sandiford.  We heard the evidence for the purposes of deciding whether toadmit it as fresh evidence pursuant to section 23 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1968 and, if it was admitted, to determine whether Mr Adedeji’s conviction was safe.
The chronology of events about the identification by PC McGregor of Mr Adedeji as the person appearing in a video clip is based on the evidence given by Mr McMeekin.  It appears that it was only some six weeks before the trial that the prosecution served a statement from PC McGregor in which he purported to identify Mr Adedeji in a nine second video clip.  The clip and a still photograph taken from it showed a young man with his hood up and wearing a blue bandana and someone was rapping with drill music in the background.  The prosecution case was that blue was the colour associated with the M40 gang.  The video clip had been recovered from Mr Oni’s phone.
The video clip was played for us at the appeal a number of times, but it was difficult to identify what was said during the rap.  PC McGregor had first stated in his witness statements that the words were “Aye, aye, aye D why you so rude yo”.  In evidence PC McGregor said “RD, why are you so rude” and the prosecution later suggested that it was “RTD you’re so rude”.  The development from D to RD (which might be Rochdale) to RTD (which was the name of the rival gang) was said by Mr Monteith in submissions to be evidence of the stereotyping of Mr Adedeji as a gang member involved in a feud.  Details of the circumstances in which PC McGregor came to identify Mr Adedeji were not particularised in the statement served before the trial.
The defence statement served on behalf of Mr Adedeji did not address this piece of identification evidence for the reason that the evidence had not been served at that stage, nor had Mr Adedeji been interviewed about it.  Following service of this evidence it is apparent that Mr Adedeji denied to his legal team that he was the person in the video, and that was consistent with his evidence at trial.  He said the person in the video was called Tyrone, whose second name he did not know, and whose whereabouts he did not know.  Mr Adedeji found on social media a photograph of Tyrone, shown outside an identifiable shop.  It appears that Mr McMeekin and his solicitors considered whether to make further inquiries at the shop to find the identity of Tyrone, but it seems that they considered that it would be very difficult to find Tyrone given the paucity of information.  Instead the defence prepared a small bundle of photographs for the jury, in which the photograph of Tyrone was put alongside the still from the video clip, and then a photograph of Mr Adedeji was put alongside the still from the video clip.  Mr McMeekin took the view that it was obvious that the person in the video clip was not Mr Adedeji.  Although there was a difference in view between counsel and solicitors about whether to challenge the admission of the photographs, in the event no challenge was made.  At the trial it is apparent from the transcripts that there was cross examination on behalf of Mr Adedeji of at least one co-defendant about whether he knew Tyrone.
We do not find that the judge was wrong to admit the video clip on the basis of the facts before him.  First no challenge to its admissibility was made.  Secondly it was apparent that PC McGregor had purported to recognise Mr Adedeji when going through the download from Mr Oni’s phone.  It is right to record that PC McGregor had not given details of exactly when this occurred, but it was reasonable for Mr Adedeji’s legal team to consider that the evidence was likely to be admitted in such circumstances.
Mr McMeekin’s view about the effect of the clip of photographs of the still from the video and Mr Adedeji and Tyrone was not the view taken by the prosecution at trial.  It was pointed out in closing that Tyrone had, in the photograph taken outside the shop, a different and lighter skin tone than the person shown in the video, although it is apparent that the light in which and angle at which a person is photographed may affect such matters.
The judge gave full directions on the identification evidence in which the judge specifically noted that although PC McGregor had been able to observe Mr Adedeji over a substantial period during his police interview, it was many months later that he made the identification in the video clip, and he was not able to say how many months. The judge warned the jury to avoid the risk of “confirmatory bias” which concept was explained in the direction.
So far as the fresh evidence is concerned having heard Mr McMeekin we are satisfied that it would be appropriate to admit the evidence both from Mr McMeekin and Mr Numa, pursuant to section 23 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1968.  This is because: the evidence appears to the Court to be capable of belief, for reasons given below in relation to Mr Numa; the evidence from Mr Numa might afford a ground for allowing the appeal because it would call into question the reliability of the identification evidence from PC McGregor; the evidence would have been admissible in the proceedings at trial; and there is a reasonable explanation for the failure to adduce the evidence in those proceedings.
As to the last point we accept to a degree Mr Sandiford’s submission that more effort might have been made to find Mr Numa perhaps through social media or, we suppose, through enquiry agents but, having heard Mr McMeekin, we accept that the matter was conscientiously considered by Mr Adedeji’s legal advisers.  They made reasonable decisions when dealing with what was, in the scheme of these proceedings, comparatively late evidence.
This brings us back to Mr Numa’s evidence and whether it is capable of belief.  There was nothing to suggest that Mr Numa was aware at the time of the trial of the discrete issue of whether PC McGregor’s identification of the person in the video clip was Mr Adedeji.  Mr Numa gave evidence that he was the person in the video clip, and it was apparent from seeing Mr Numa at court that if it was not clear that he was the person, there was sufficient resemblance for that evidence to be capable of being believed.  There were some unsatisfactory features about Mr Numa’s evidence, for example about what was being said on the clip, and why it was being said, and who had recorded it.  That said, having considered his evidence as a whole, and having reflected on the fact that Mr Numa was unlikely to expose himself to the risk of a prosecution for perverting the course of justice or perjury by coming to court in a matter that did not concern him, we accept Mr Numa’s evidence that he was the person shown in the video clip.
In these circumstances it follows that PC McGregor’s identification of Mr Adedeji as the person on the video clip was wrong.  It is necessary to consider the effect of that wrong identification on the safety of Mr Adedeji’s conviction.
It is apparent that the video clip was relied on to show that Mr Adedeji wore a blue bandana, and that the prosecution alleged that blue was the colour of the M40 gang, suggesting that he was closer to the M40 gang than he accepted.  As noted above the prosecution also relied on the cash by the ear and the fact that Mr Adedeji had a picture of John Soyoye on his phone in blue kit with MD40 on the back.  Mr Adedeji gave a number of answers to this evidence, pointing out that the cash by the ear photograph was what celebrities did, and that John Soyoye was his best friend, whom he had known through Church, and was like a brother to him, so it was not surprising that he had a photograph of him.
We also note that although Mr Savi was not alleged to have any prior links to the M40 gang, he was convicted on the basis of the Telegram chat.  This suggests that the prosecution might not have needed to go to the effort of attempting to tie Mr Adedeji to the M40 gang, and could just have relied on the Telegram chat alone.  It is apparent that in that chat Mr Adedeji gave the address and location of persons who were believed to have been involved in the murder of John Soyoye on the Telegram chat and discussed “touching” persons.
We also note, however, that Mr Adedeji was cross examined about this issue of his identification as the person in the video clip, and the issue of the video clip did feature in the prosecution closing submissions in support of the case against Mr Adedeji.  This was in circumstances where Mr Adedeji put forward evidence challenging the identification, which was submitted by the prosecution in closing to lack credibility.  The jury might have wrongly found that he was the young man in the video clip, and might have regarded his denial as undermining his credibility, which was central to his defence.  In circumstances where: a false identification of Mr Adedeji in the video clip was made; and Mr Adedeji’s identification of “Tyrone” was correct; we find that Mr Adedeji’s conviction is unsafe.  The evidence of identification was part of the chain of evidence linking Mr Adedeji to the M40 gang, and was relied on by the prosecution.  For these reasons, and in the light of the fresh evidence given by Mr Numa, we quash Mr Adedeji’s conviction.
No retrial – issue seven
This brings us to the issue of the retrial.  It was apparent from all of the evidence that Mr Adedeji had a case to answer on count of conspiracy to cause grievous bodily harm with intent.  He had identified on the Telegram chat persons believed to be responsible for the death of his best friend in the context of a discussion of “touching”, which it was common ground referred to stabbing.  We have already noted that Mr Savi was convicted on the basis of the evidence of what he had said on the two chats, together with evidence of what had been done afterwards to persons believed to be responsible for the murder of John Soyoye.
In these circumstances we would have considered it in the interests of justice to order a retrial save for one particular feature.  This arises from our decision to allow the appeal on sentence for Mr Savi and Mr Okoya and to impose a sentence of 4 years 6 months less the discounts given by the judge for time served.  We can say that the sentence which would have been imposed on Mr Adedeji if we had found his conviction to be safe would not have exceeded that sentence of 4 years 6 months (it is not necessary to calculate the exact sentence because his conviction has been quashed).  In such circumstances Mr Adedeji has already served the time that he would have had to serve if convicted, given his role in the conspiracy. We therefore do not order a retrial.
The appeal against sentence – issue eight
Ms Mogan, on behalf of Mr Adedeji, submitted that the sentence was wrong in principle and manifestly excessive because: the judge took account of the violence of those convicted of the conspiracy to commit murder; the judge had failed to have proper regard to the Sentencing Children and Young Persons guideline and the principles summarised in R v ZA [2023] EWCA Crim 596; [2023] 2 Cr App R(S) 45; the judge failed to have proper regard to the appellant’s role in the conspiracy; and the judge failed to give consideration to the disproportionality of sentencing in relation to black defendants as identified by the Sentencing Council guidelines.  These submissions were adopted on behalf of Mr Savi and Mr Okoya by Mr Temkin and Mr Kane.  It was submitted that the sentencing was mechanistic and that there was no fair reflection of what the individuals had done, which meant that Mr Thomas (Junior) and another defendant Mr Thorne had received the same sentences when their actions were more serious and not comparable.
Mr Smith on behalf of the prosecution identified relevant parts of the Telegram chat and the activities that had taken place after the chat.  He submitted that the trial judge was uniquely placed to assess culpability, that these were sentences imposed after a trial which took place over some 10 weeks, and that the sentences were neither wrong in principle or manifestly excessive.  Mr Smith submitted that Mr Thomas (Junior) and Mr Thorne may have been fortunate in their sentences, but that did not make the sentences imposed on Mr Savi and Mr Okoya (or Mr Adedeji) wrong.
In R v Greenfield (1973) 57 Cr App R 849, which was approved in Ali at paragraph 38, it was recorded that it was for the trial judge to determine the role of a particular defendant in the conspiracy.  We also have particular regard to the fact that the sentences were imposed by the judge who had heard the trial over a period of some 10 weeks.
As to the first point, in our judgment the judge was entitled to take account of the actions of those who were party to the conspiracy to cause really serious bodily harm with intent, which included all of the defendants in this particular case, for the detailed reasons given above.  The judge was not entitled to take account, and did not take account, of statements made about their intentions by those who were party to the separate conspiracy to murder.  Whether the judge reflected on the actual roles played by Mr Savi and Mr Okoya (and Mr Adedeji if his conviction had not been quashed) is a separate point to which we return below.
As to the second point on sentencing children and young persons, it is right to say that the judge did not follow the stepped approach suggested in ZA but it is apparent that the judge did have regard to the principles relevant to sentencing children and young persons and did make a discount to the sentence to reflect this.  In this case a Youth Rehabilitation Order with intensive supervision was not an appropriate sentence.  This is because Mr Savi and Mr Okoya joined a conspiracy to cause grievous bodily harm to members of the RTD gang who were believed to have been involved in the murder of John Soyoye, and there were attacks carried out on those persons pursuant to the conspiracy.
As to the third point, as noted above, the judge concluded that the assault guideline for offences of section 18 grievous bodily harm provided was the appropriate starting point and categorised the offending as category 1A because the overt acts on the 16 and 28 December involved “high culpability”, with a significant degree of planning and premeditation, the use of highly dangerous weapons and revenge violence.  He found that there was Category 1 “harm” because particularly grave or life-threatening injury was intended.  The second of those incidents involved a sustained attack with machetes and an attempt to drive over the victim as he lay on the ground.
In our judgment the judge’s approach had the effect of treating Mr Savi and Mr Okoya (and Mr Adedeji) as if they were participating in the actual attack, and failed to reflect the fact that their role in the planning of the attacks lasted for a short period of time a month before any violence was carried out.  In our judgment the level of culpability most appropriate for Mr Savi and Mr Okoya (and Mr Adedeji) was “lesser role in group activity”.  This is apparent from their respective contributions on the chats, and the absence of their involvement on the ground.  They were not, in any sense, the leaders of this conspiracy sending others to do the work on the ground.
Further it is not apparent from what was said by Mr Savi, Mr Okoya (and Mr Adedeji) that anything more than “grave injury” category 2 harm, was intended by them.  There was no evidence on which the judge could be sure that they had intended “particularly grave or life threatening injury” (which has to be calibrated taking into account the fact that the offence itself requires very serious injury) as opposed to “grave injury”, because they were neither present at the particular attack in December or had been involved in deciding what should take place during that attack.
In these circumstances in our judgment the appropriate category for an adult would have been medium culpability B (lesser role in group activity) and category 2 (grave injury).  This would give a starting point of 5 years with a range of 4-7 years.  The judge was right to aggravate from the starting point to take account of the actions carried out pursuant to the conspiracy, which should have taken the sentence to the top of the range of 7 years.  Further as this was a conspiracy the judge had to reflect the intended harm of further attacks, which might have justified going above the sentencing range for one attack.
There were then discounts for mitigation which included positive good character, and evidence from pre-sentence reports and expert psychologists, and then a discount to reflect age and immaturity.  Given the respective roles that Mr Savi and Mr Okoya had carried out, and their particular mitigation and circumstances, the judge was right not to draw a distinction in sentence between them.  In our judgment a proportionate sentence to be imposed on Mr Savi and Mr Okoya would have been four years six months custody, to which the discounts for time served identified by the judge are to be applied.
As to the final point about disproportionality when sentencing Black defendants under the guideline for section 18 offences, the Sentencing Council guidelines specifically identify that sentencers should be aware that there is evidence of disparity in sentence outcomes that indicates that for Black and Asian offenders immediate custodial sentence lengths have on average been longer than for White, Mixed and Chinese or other ethnicity offenders.  This is important guidance and we have had regard to it in identifying the appropriate sentences for Mr Savi and Mr Okoya.
We therefore allow the appeals against sentence of Mr Savi and Mr Okoya.  We therefore quash the sentences of 8 years’ detention and instead impose for each of them sentences of 4 years and 6 months detention in a Young Offender Institution.  As before, the time served on remand, including the days on qualifying curfew specified by the judge, will count towards sentence.
Conclusion
For the detailed reasons given above, we dismiss the appeals against conviction of the appellants save Mr Adedeji, whose appeal against conviction is allowed in the light of fresh evidence going to the issue of his identification in a video clip.  We do not order a retrial.  We allow the appeals against sentence of Mr Savi and Mr Okoya and in substitution for their sentences of 8 years detention we impose for each of them a sentence of 4 years 6 months detention, and, as before, the time served on remand including the days on qualifying curfew specified by the judge, will count towards sentence.

MR JUSTICE TROWER
Mr Justice Trower:
This judgment is concerned with the costs of the applications determined by a judgment I handed down on 28 November 2024 ([2024] EWHC 3040 (Ch)) (the “November Judgment”).  I shall use the same abbreviations I used in the November Judgment.  It is not necessary for me to describe the underlying dispute, or the course which the Part 7 claim and the petition have taken in any detail because these matters are described in the November Judgment.
In light of the way in which TopCo, MidCo, BidCo and BMW (the “BIG Parties”), Investor, Mr Vaughan and Mr Fardad have presented their submissions, I shall deal both with the basis (standard or indemnity) on which costs should be awarded and the question of whether I should make a summary assessment later in this judgment.  The remaining costs disputes can most conveniently be determined separately in relation to each of the applications determined at the November hearing.  I shall do so in the order in which they are dealt with in the version of the draft order prepared by PWHL and Mr Waddell. They are as follows:
The application by PWHL as part of the Petition Application for permission to amend the petition and points of claim, with consequential directions for the service of amended points of defence and replies (the “Petition Amendment Application”), which was contested in part at the November hearing by TopCo, Mr Fardad and Mr Vaughan.
The application by PWHL as part of the Petition Application for a direction that TopCo be prevented from filing and serving points of defence in the petition (the “Debarring Application”), which was contested at the November hearing by Topco.
The application by PWHL and Mr Waddell as part of the Part 7 Application for permission to amend the claim form and to file and serve re-amended particulars of claim, with consequential directions for the service of amended defences and replies (the “Part 7 Amendment Application”), which was not contested at the November hearing.
The application by PWHL and Mr Waddell as part of the Part 7 Application for a stay of the Part 7 claim until after resolution of the petition (the “Stay Application”), which was contested at the November hearing by the BIG Parties and Investor.
It is unnecessary for me to address the costs of the application relating to expedition because the parties are agreed that these be Investor’s costs in the petition.  It is also unnecessary for me to deal with the costs of PWHL’s application for permission to join Mr Fardad and Mr Vaughan as respondents to the petition (the “Joinder Application”).  PWHL’s initial position in relation to the costs of the Joinder Application was that the right order was costs in the petition, while TopCo, Mr Vaughan and Mr Fardad said that there should be no order for costs.  There is no longer an issue because, in its reply submissions on costs, PWHL accepted that the right order was for there to be no order as to costs.  I also understand it to be common ground that general case management costs be costs in the petition and the Part 7 claim as the case may be.
The Petition Amendment Application
The parties’ positions in relation to the costs of the Petition Amendment Application are as follows:
TopCo and Mr Vaughan seek an order that PWHL pay their costs of contesting the amendments which were not allowed, to be summarily assessed on the indemnity basis.  TopCo also seeks an order that PWHL pay its costs of and occasioned by the amendments to the petition on the standard basis.
Investor was neutral on the Petition Amendment Application and seeks no order as to costs, while Mr Fardad seeks an order that PWHL pay his costs to be summarily assessed on the standard basis.  Investor also seeks an order that PWHL pay its costs of and occasioned by the amendments to the petition on the standard basis.
PWHL's primary position is that the costs should be reserved to the further CMC to be listed on the first convenient date after 7 April 2025.  Its alternative position is that the costs of contesting the amendments should be costs in the case as between PWHL and TopCo and that PWHL should pay 75% of Investor’s and TopCo's costs consequent on the amendments.
The first issue is whether I should decide any questions of costs at all at this stage.  PWHL says that it would be appropriate for both the costs of contesting amendments to the petition and the costs consequential on those amendments to be reserved to the next CMC on the grounds that TopCo’s response (when it comes) will be relevant.  It is said that, if the case pleaded in TopCo’s defence were to be amended in a manner which demonstrated that PWHL’s original criticisms of TopCo’s partiality in favour of Investor might have been well-founded, this would show that a proportion of the costs of the contested amendments should be paid by TopCo.  It was also said that TopCo might plead matters in its amended points of defence which should have been pleaded earlier, which might result in wasted costs.
In my view, none of these reasons provides a proper justification for reserving costs to a future CMC after the stage at which the parties’ pleaded cases have crystalised.  The Petition Amendment Application was concerned with drafts of an amended petition and amended points of claim which PWHL sought permission to file and serve.  No alternative version was advanced before or at the November hearing and I refused permission on the grounds that the case as formulated either raised allegations which were not arguable or, to the extent that they alluded to arguable allegations, they were not in a form for which permission to amend could properly be granted.  As to this latter point, I agree with TopCo’s submission that it was not for TopCo to reformulate PWHL’s draft amendments into an appropriate form for it to pursue.
I also think that this latter point is an answer to PWHL’s alternative position, which gives rise to the second issue.  It seeks by way of alternative an order that the costs of contesting the amendments should be costs in the case because it was successful in the element of its proposed amendments which were concerned with the manner in which the points of defence were pleaded.  It relies on [58] of the November Judgment in which I concluded that “PWHL has a prospect which is more than fanciful of establishing that TopCo’s approach to the form of its defence to the petition is capable of being stigmatised as conduct amounting to unfairness or breach of duty by its directors”.  However, I went on to explain in [59] that the existing form of PWHL’s petition was inadequate and refused the relief sought on those grounds.  In these circumstances, it is not to the point that, if the case had been appropriately pleaded in the first place, permission might have been granted.
It follows that the costs in relation to the Petition Amendment Application, which were incurred at and in preparation for the November hearing, ought to be determined at this stage.  It also follows that, because TopCo was the successful party on those aspects of the application which were opposed and because it is not suggested that TopCo delayed in consenting to those amendment which were not disputed, TopCo’s costs of the Petition Amendment Application should be paid by PWHL as the unsuccessful party.
The next question is whether Mr Fardad and Mr Vaughan should also be entitled to their costs.  PWHL submitted that it would be wrong in principle for such an order to be made because Mr Fardad and Mr Vaughan were not yet parties to the petition, even though they had consented to being joined.   It was also said that Mr Edward Davies KC (acting for TopCo and Mr Vaughan) had emphasised that fact when explaining why it was proper for TopCo itself (rather than Mr Vaughan) to be disputing the TopCo Defence Allegations, while Mr George Spalton KC (for Investor and Mr Fardad) made no submissions on the Petition Amendment Application at the November hearing.
Mr Fardad submitted that it would be absurd to deny him his costs because, if he had not opposed the Petition Amendment Application, it would have been possible for PWHL to serve the amended petition and points of claim on him, even if permission had been refused as against TopCo.  Once formally joined, Mr Fardad could then have applied for summary judgment, which he would have been granted because the court would already have held (as against TopCo) that amendments in that form had no real prospect of success.  It was also said that it would be particularly absurd because the TopCo Defence Allegations, which were the principal subject of the opposition to the Petition Amendment Application, were concerned with breaches of duty by him and Mr Vaughan who were therefore the most obvious parties to argue that they lacked a real prospect of success.
I agree that the fact that Mr Fardad and Mr Vaughan had not been joined to the petition at the time of the November hearing is not of itself an answer to the application. This is not just because the Joinder Application was unopposed.  It was also because they were accused of misfeasance and because part of the relief sought by PWHL was an order that they be required to file and serve points of defence to whatever form the points of claim took as a result of the hearing, an aspect of the dispute on which they had a legitimate position to advance.  It was obviously appropriate from a case management perspective for all of the heads of relief sought in the Petition Application to be considered in conjunction with each other.  In my judgment, it would be wrong in principle to conclude that no costs should be awarded to Mr Fardad and Mr Vaughan for that reason, even though there are other aspects of their positions which were not identical to each other.
Mr Fardad was represented jointly with Investor, which did not oppose the Petition Amendment Application (it consented to those which concerned it and was neutral on those amendments which were opposed by TopCo).  As only a minimal amount of Investor’s costs is attributable to the Petition Amendment Application, it and Mr Fardad contend that such costs as were incurred by either of them and are attributable to the Petition Amendment Application were incurred on behalf of Mr Fardad, who was successful in his opposition.
PWHL submitted that Mr Spalton made no oral submissions on the Petition Amendment Application at the November hearing, and that the evidence adduced from Mr Fardad was short and did not address the partiality point at all.  That submission only tells part of the story, because, in circumstances in which Mr Davies had already made the points which required to be made in relation to the contested aspects of the Petition Amendment Application, it was the right course for Mr Spalton to take, while in his evidence Mr Fardad adopted much of what had already been said in writing on behalf of TopCo.  In my view, none of this affects the fact that PWHL made Mr Fardad a party to the application in which the amendments were sought, that Mr Fardad had his own personal interest in the outcome and that he (amongst others) was successful in his opposition.  I therefore think that as a matter of principle, he, as one of the successful parties, is entitled to his costs against PWHL as the unsuccessful party.
The position of Mr Vaughan is different to this extent.  Unlike Mr Fardad, Mr Vaughan had chosen joint representation with TopCo which (unlike Investor which does not seek its costs of the Petition Amendment Application) engaged in active opposition.  In those circumstances, there is more of an argument that a separate costs order is only justified to the extent that the costs were necessarily increased by separate submissions which had to be made on behalf of Mr Vaughan.  However, as will become apparent when I explain my conclusions on assessment, it seems to me that this goes to the question of the appropriate attribution of costs as between Mr Vaughan and the BIG Parties, having regard to the reasonableness of the totality of the costs which were incurred on their behalf.  It does not affect the fact that, as with Mr Fardad, PWHL made Mr Vaughan a party to the Petition Amendment Application, that Mr Vaughan had his own personal interest in the outcome and that he (amongst others) was successful in his opposition.  I therefore think that as a matter of principle, he, as one of the successful parties, is entitled to his costs against PWHL as the unsuccessful party.
The next question is the costs consequential to the amendments, which both Investor and TopCo say should be paid by PWHL.  The usual rule is that the costs of and occasioned by amendments are borne by the party seeking permission to amend, in this case PWHL (Taylor v Burton [2014] EWCA Civ 21 at [30]).  This will include the costs to be incurred by Investor and TopCo in preparing, filing and serving its amended points of defence.
However, PWHL submits that, anyway in part, the usual rule should not apply in this case because certain of the amendments could not have been made at the time of the original petition.  In support of this submission it relies on the principles discussed by Joanna Smith J in Lendlease Construction (Europe) Ltd v Aecom Ltd [2022] EWHC 2855 (TCC) at [5], i.e., that “whilst the usual order would be appropriate in a case where there had been a change of tack by the amending party, such that duplicative work was caused to the other party, nonetheless that reasoning would not necessarily apply when new information has come to light which could not have been pleaded previously”.  This cites and relies on the earlier decision of Mann J in Various Claimants v MGN Ltd [2021] 4 WLR 55 at [31] to [36].
On the face of it, I am only concerned with the costs consequential to the amendments which were before the court at the time of the November hearing and for which permission was granted.  This does not therefore include the costs consequential to the TopCo Defence Allegations for which permission was not then granted.  However, as I understand the position, Investor and TopCo have now consented to a new pleading of a pared-down version of the TopCo Defence Allegations and each of TopCo, Investor and PWHL made their costs submissions on the basis that the form of amended points of claim with which I am now concerned is that which was served on 13 December 2024.
I have considered the version of the amendments for which permission is to be granted and have reached the view that, although a substantial majority of the re-amendments could have been made at the time of the petition, the usual rule described in Taylor v Burton does not necessarily apply on the grounds that they could not have been expected to plead some of the allegations at the outset in large part because they had not yet occurred.  This is either because they relate to wholly new events (such as those relied on in making the current form of the TopCo Defence Allegations) or because they were a continuation of what was said to be existing unfairly prejudicial conduct.
Although, having regard to the amendments as a whole, the matters which fall into this category come close to being insufficient to justify separate treatment from the usual rule, a conclusion which was urged on me by both TopCo and Investor, I think that PWHL has established that the consequential costs of a small proportion of the amendments ought to be costs in the case.  As nobody suggests that it would be right to reflect this in an issue-based costs order, I agree that a small percentage reduction is appropriate.  However, I do not agree that 25% is the right percentage to exclude from the usual rule.  In my view the right order is that 85% of the costs consequential to the amendments should be paid by PWHL in any event, and 15% should be costs in the case.
The Debarring Application
The parties’ positions in relation to the costs of the Debarring Application were as follows:
TopCo seeks an order that PWHL pay its costs to be summarily assessed on the indemnity basis.
PWHL accepts that it should pay TopCo’s costs of the Debarring Application but only on the standard basis; it seeks a detailed assessment and suggests an interim payment of £15,000.
The differences between the parties therefore relate only to (a) the basis for an award of costs, (b) whether the court should make an order for summary assessment or should direct a detailed assessment with an interim payment on account and (c) the amounts which PWHL should pay at this stage in the relevant eventuality.  It follows that there are no other costs disputes relating specifically to the Debarring Application which need to be determined separately.
The Part 7 Amendment Application
The parties’ positions in relation to the costs of the Part 7 Amendment Application were as follows:
The BIG Parties and Investor seek an order that PWHL and Mr Waddell pay their costs of and occasioned by the re-amendments to the particulars of claim on the standard basis.
PWHL and Mr Waddell accept that they should pay the BIG Parties’ and Investor’s costs of the Part 7 Amendment Application but contend that they should only pay 75% of their costs of and occasioned by the re-amendments to the particulars of claim, to be subject to detailed assessment on the standard basis if not agreed.
As all of the amendments were consented to, it is accepted that PWHL and Mr Waddell should pay the BIG Parties’ and Investor’s costs of the Part 7 Amendment Application on the standard basis.  What is not agreed is whether PWHL and Mr Waddell should be relieved from the usual rule of paying all of the costs of and occasioned by the amendments (as per Taylor v Burton at [30]) on the grounds explained in Lendlease Construction – see paragraph 16 above.
It is submitted that a proportional order (75% / 25%) should be made of the same type as the order sought in relation to the costs of and occasioned by the amendments to the petition.  I do not agree.  From the way in which the principle described in Lendlease is articulated, it has always been recognised that it does not give rise to an invariable rule.  In my view, it may not be appropriate to depart from the usual order on those grounds where only a very small proportion of the costs which will be incurred in responding to amendments relate to allegations which could not have been pleaded at the outset.
In the present case PWHL and Mr Waddell only rely on a very minimal number of re-amendments to the particulars of claim which fall into this category, and it is difficult to see how even some of those (e.g., paragraphs 101A and 101B) in fact do so.  In any event they are materially less significant than those amendments to the petition which could be so described.  In my judgment, the usual Taylor v Burton order is the just order to make.  The consequence is that the BIG Parties’ and Investor’s costs of and occasioned by the re-amendments to the particulars of claim are to be paid by PWHL on the standard basis.
The Stay Application
The parties’ positions in relation to the costs of the Stay Application were as follows:
The BIG Parties seek an order that PWHL and Mr Waddell pay their costs to be summarily assessed on the indemnity basis.
Investor seeks an order that PWHL and Mr Waddell pay its costs to be summarily assessed on the indemnity basis.
PWHL and Mr Waddell accept that they should pay the costs of the BIG Parties on the standard basis, but they seek a detailed assessment and suggest an interim payment of £40,000.
PWHL and Mr Waddell accept that they should pay 50% of Investor’s costs on the standard basis, but they seek a detailed assessment and suggest an interim payment of £10,000.
The first issue relates to the application of CPR 44.2, which provides that, although the court may make a different order, the general rule is that the unsuccessful party will be ordered to pay the costs of the successful party.  Although, PWHL and Mr Waddell accept that in principle they (as the unsuccessful party) must pay the BIG Parties’ assessed costs of the Stay Application, they do not accept that they should pay all of Investor’s costs.
The basis on which they do so is that the Stay Application was a case management proposal to remove the need for TopCo to participate at the trial and, in reflection of that, Investor contributed little to the November hearing, either in oral submissions or its skeleton argument.  They also ask me to infer that there was an agreement between the BIG Parties and Investor that counsel for TopCo could use the time available, a circumstance which was said to be relevant, presumably in support of a submission that Investor was content to have its own interests protected by the submissions made on behalf of TopCo.  They also point out that I did not accept Investor’s reliance on a test of rare and compelling circumstances (Jefferies International v Cantor Fitzgerald [2020] EWHC 1381 (QB)) in the current case: see [77] to [80] of the November Judgment.
I do not accept these submissions.  PWHL and Mr Waddell chose to sue both the BIG Parties and Investor in the Part 7 claim, in circumstances in which they had separate and distinct interests to protect.  The fact that in the event Mr Spalton only addressed the court on the Stay Application very briefly is explained by the fact that in the event the points on which he was ready to address the court were largely dealt with by Mr Davies.  He therefore adopted the sensible and proportionate approach of not seeking to repeat them; all the more important given the timing constraints for the hearing.
This does not detract from the fact that it was appropriate for Investor to make detailed written submissions (which were of assistance to the court) and to be fully prepared to deal with the Stay Application by instructing leading and junior counsel for that purpose.  The Stay Application was of very considerable significance to the future conduct of the dispute.  While there may be applications in the future in respect of which it will be clear from the outset that it would be proportionate for one or other of the BIG Defendants or Investor to take a back seat and temper their representation accordingly, this was not one of them.
As to the argument in relation to rare and compelling circumstances, I do not consider that it can properly be said that, as a result of making a legal argument on the precise nature of the test for a stay which I did not accept, Investor was no longer the successful party, nor did it mean that PWHL and Mr Waddell won on a specific issue.  The point took up very little of the court’s time (it was addressed briefly by Mr Daniel Oudkerk KC in his oral submissions) but was not in my judgment the kind of point which justifies a separate issue-based costs order or a proportionate reduction in the amount of Investor’s costs for which PWHL and Mr Waddell should be liable to pay.
Indemnity Costs
The next question is whether the BIG Parties’ and Investor’s costs of the Stay Application should be paid by PWHL and Mr Waddell on the indemnity basis.  Much of what was said to justify such an order also related to the applications by TopCo and Mr Vaughan for indemnity costs in relation to the Petition Amendment Application and by TopCo for indemnity costs in relation to the Debarring Application.  I shall therefore deal with these applications together.
It was common ground that an order for indemnity costs may be appropriate where the conduct of the relevant parties or the particular circumstances of the case take the situation “out of the norm” in a way which justifies such an order (Excelsior Commercial and Industrial Holdings Ltd [2002] EWCA Civ 879 at [31] – [32] and [39]. The phrase “out of the norm” means “something outside the ordinary and reasonable conduct of proceedings” (Esure Service Ltd v Quarco [2009] EWCA Civ 595 at [25]).
PWHL and Mr Waddell submitted, in reliance on Suez Fortune Investments Ltd v Talbot Underwriting Ltd [2019] EWHC 3300 (Comm) at [2], that it was important to remember that, whereas costs on the standard basis must be proportionate and any doubt as to whether the costs were reasonably and proportionately incurred must be resolved in favour of the paying party, costs on the indemnity basis are not subject to the requirement of proportionality (with consequences that may well be financially significant) and any doubts must be resolved in favour of the receiving party.  They also reminded me that Teare J in Suez Fortune adopted what Morgan J said in Digicel (St Lucia) Ltd v Cable and Wireless Plc [2010] 5 Costs LR 709 at [19] to the effect that these differences are important for the court to bear in mind when considering whether the conduct of the paying party is sufficiently unreasonable or inappropriate to justify an order for indemnity costs.
I agree that these are important considerations to bear in mind.  I also accept that, in considering whether or not particular conduct is out of the norm, the court must be satisfied either of misconduct or conduct deserving of moral condemnation, or that there has been conduct which is unreasonable to a high degree.
They also submitted that the mere fact that a claim which can be seen to be weak is not of itself sufficient to justify an order for indemnity costs, even if it can be seen to be “thoroughly bad” and does not (or would not) survive an application for summary judgment.  I agree that that is the case.  It will not normally be sufficient for the ground relied on to be that the paying party’s conduct was wrong or misguided with the benefit of hindsight; something more, such as misconduct deserving of moral condemnation or conduct which is unreasonable to a high degree, is required.  Thus, if the Stay Application could properly be described as “speculative, weak, opportunistic and thin” (to adopt the language of the Court of Appeal in Lejonvarn v Burgess [2020] Costs LR 45 at [44], citing with approval the judgment of Tomlinson J in Three Rivers DC v Bank of England [2006] 5 Costs LR 714 at [25(5)]), indemnity costs may be justified.
But the application of even this principle all depends on the precise circumstances of the case and conduct which cannot properly be stigmatised as unreasonable to a high degree can also justify an order for indemnity costs when taken into account as one of an “aggregation of factors” (Suez Fortune at [11]).  Another way of putting the same point is that the authorities support an approach which recognises that the degree to which a point is a bad one may go into the scales when deciding whether to make an order for indemnity costs (Investor and PWHL both cited Dixon v Radley House Partnership [2016] EWHC 3485 (QB) at [6] to this effect).
The basic circumstance on which the BIG Parties relied was that both the Stay Application and the Debarring Application were fundamentally misconceived, not least because the combination of success on both applications would lead to a manifestly unfair and unjust result.  They said that this was illustrated by the fact that PWHL and Mr Waddell said that a stay was appropriate on the grounds that the Part 7 issues could be determined in a binding manner in the petition, even though three of the defendants in the Part 7 claim (MidCo, BidCo and BMW) were not even parties to the petition.  In the same context, Investor also said, in support of a submission that the Stay Application was sufficiently speculative, weak, opportunistic and thin to justify an award of indemnity costs, that PWHL and Mr Waddell never advanced a coherent explanation as to which of the Part 7 issues would be left undecided once the petition had been determined – a fundamental aspect of any application for a stay on these particular case management grounds.  Nor did they ever explain why the overlap between the issues did not point to joint case management rather than a stay of the Part 7 claim.
This was said by both Investor and the BIG Parties to have been exacerbated by the fundamental volte face on the part of PWHL and Mr Waddell which I have described at some length in the November Judgment, and which will have caused very significant wasted expenditure.  This was conduct which demonstrated a high degree of unreasonableness because they were seeking a stay of a claim which they themselves had started, which had been underway for five months and for some considerable time after they had changed their legal team and which was the subject of an order for expedition which they had sought and obtained from Mr Rosen KC on determination of their unsuccessful application for injunctive relief. In [75] of the November Judgment I described this flatly inconsistent conduct as one of the circumstances which gives rise to a powerful inference that PWHL and Mr Waddell were not doing enough to help the court to further the overriding objective in accordance with their duty under CPR 1.3.  I agree with the BIG Parties’ characterisation of what I said in [75] of the November Judgment as a significant criticism.
I consider therefore that it is right to describe the Stay Application as speculative, weak, opportunistic and thin.  With particular reference to its speculative and opportunistic nature, there was never a proper explanation as to why a stay of the Part 7 claim was a remotely sensible way to case manage the two sets of proceedings (as opposed to joint case management).  Nor was there ever a sensible explanation for why PWHL and Mr Waddell changed their minds from their original pleaded contention at the time of the issue of the petition that joint case management was the right approach.  I do not go so far as to say, as asserted by Investor, that PWHL and Mr Waddell appreciated that the Stay Application was hopeless or nearly so but decided to pursue it anyway.  However, it is right to record that I came close to reaching that conclusion in light of the circumstances in which it was issued, including the facts that there was no pre-warning, and that the volte face came out of the blue.
The BIG Parties submitted that the highly unreasonable conduct of PWHL and Mr Waddell in relation to the Stay Application was intimately linked both to the Debarring Application and that contested part of the Petition Amendment Application which accused TopCo’s directors of misfeasance in causing TopCo to serve points of defence at all.  It is said that this was all part of the same pattern of inconsistent conduct and meant that the application was obviously hopeless in light of the earlier agreement by PWHL and Mr Wadell that TopCo could take the very course of which they now made serious criticism in the form of an allegation of misfeasance.  In the light of that clear agreement, reached by PWHL and approved by the court, an application for permission to amend in order to allege that the mere filing of a defence was a misfeasant act was always hopeless.
In my view, and notwithstanding the general principle described by Hoffmann J in Crossmore, TopCo’s argument that it should not be prevented from separate participation in the petition in respect of its own separate interests was always a good one (see the points made by SH as described in [23] of the November Judgment and my conclusions as to the applicable test at [43] and elsewhere).  However, I accept that, absent the prior agreement, PWHL’s answer to the reasons why TopCo contended that it had its own separate interests to protect might simply have been regarded as one which can be seen in hindsight to have been weak (as to which see the citation from Kiam v MGN Ltd (No 2) [2002] EWCA Civ 66 in Excelsior at [30]).  In such circumstances, indemnity costs would not have been justified.
However, the prior agreement cast the argument in a very different light.  In my view, the Debarring Application was also always going to be speculative, weak, opportunistic and thin, unless PWHL was able to advance a clear and convincing explanation for its change of heart.  But this was never given, and there was never any proper explanation as to why its obvious volte face was justified.  It follows that, in circumstances in which PWHL had earlier given a considered consent to TopCo’s substantive participation in the petition, I think that the Debarring Application can properly be described not just as weak and thin, but also as reflective of conduct which is to be deprecated as a speculative and opportunistic volte face for which no proper explanation was ever given.
PWHL also submits that the Petition Amendment Application could not be described as hopeless because of the conclusions I reached in [56] to [58] of the November Judgment to the effect that it had a prospect which is more than fanciful of establishing that TopCo’s approach to the form of its points of defence was capable of being stigmatised as conduct amounting to unfairness or breach of duty by its directors.  That is an accurate summary of my findings, but they had no effect on the outcome of the Petition Amendment Application itself, the costs of which are the matter with which I am concerned.  In my judgment, the fact that permission is now to be given to amend the points of claim in respects which reflect allegations that PWHL intended to make, but which were not in a properly pleaded form, does not detract from the fact that the contested parts of the Petition Amendment Application comprehensively failed.  As they were all part of the same considered course of conduct as that which included the hopeless allegations in relation to the mere filing of the points of defence and the Debarring Application, I think that it would be both artificial and disproportionate to split them out for the purpose of contending that some part of the Petition Amendment Application did not in itself warrant an order for indemnity costs.
In these circumstances, I agree with the BIG Parties and Investor that the circumstances in which the Petition Amendment Application, the Debarring Application and the Stay Application came to be made were out of the norm in the sense described in Esure, and in a manner which justifies the making of an order for indemnity costs.
Summary Assessment
The usual rule (CPR PD 44 paragraph 9.2(b)) is that a court will carry out a summary assessment at the conclusion of a hearing which has lasted not more than one day.  As the November hearing was concluded within a single day, the BIG Parties and Investor invite me to take that course.  In respect of the Petition Amendment Application and the Debarring Application, TopCo seeks £57,000.  In respect of the Petition Amendment Application Mr Fardad seeks £16,000 and Mr Vaughan seeks £69,000. In respect of the Stay Application, Investor seeks £231,000 and the BIG Parties seek £115,000.  Save for Mr Fardad’s application, all of these amounts assume a summary assessment on the indemnity basis.
PWHL say that in the current case a summary assessment is effectively impossible or impracticable, notwithstanding the fact that the hearing took a single day.  It submits that the information made available to the court is inadequate to enable it to carry out the necessary scrutiny, both because the schedules that have been filed by the BIG Parties are not broken down by reference to each application and because the BIG Parties and Mr Vaughan have made an entirely arbitrary apportionment of the costs both as between the Part 7 Application and the Petition Application and as between TopCo and Mr Vaughan.
As to Investor’s costs, it is said that summary assessment is also inappropriate because the costs schedule which has been provided supports a single figure for the hearing and spans at least five applications across the two claims.  In response, Investor says that the need to disentangle the costs is in fact a reason for summary assessment because the judge who heard the applications is in a far better position to assess allocation than a costs judge would be.
PWHL also relies on the fact that the total amounts in issue are very substantial (£488,000), which is far in excess of amounts in respect of which other judges have declined to make a summary assessment on the grounds that the amounts involved are too substantial to be dealt with in that way (Les Ambassadeurs Club Ltd v Albluewi [2020] EWHC 1368 (QB) at [16] and Broseley London Ltd v Prime Asset Management Ltd [2020] EWHC 1057 (TCC) at [27]).  While I agree that it is not uncommon for courts in the Chancery Division to make summary assessments where the amounts claimed exceed £100,000, a figure of almost £500,000 is very substantial for a one-day hearing (even one which deals with a number of different applications).  It gives rise to real questions of whether a detailed assessment is required.
In my view, there is good reason not to carry out a summary assessment and a detailed assessment is required in the present case.  There are a number of interlinked reasons for this.
The first is that it was only through adopting a very strict timetable that it was possible to get through all of the applications in a single day at the November hearing.  Those which were disputed can properly be described as substantial applications and the hearing as a whole was right at the margins of the type of hearing for which the PD envisaged that a summary assessment is appropriate.
The second is that it is impossible to tell with any degree of accuracy the reasonableness of the apportionments which have been made by the BIG Parties and Mr Vaughan as between themselves.  There has also been little attempt by the receiving parties to apportion as between the various applications which were heard at the November hearing.  Having all chosen to apportion in the way they have, that is the basis on which the court must conduct its assessment.  It has at least some immediate practical impact in relation to VAT (for which Mr Vaughan has claimed, but which no other receiving party has) and may do so in the future.  I do not agree that I have the information I need to carry out that task, nor do I agree that I am in any better a position at this stage to apportion the costs than a costs judge will be in due course.
The third relates to the claimed hourly rates, which require much more careful scrutiny than I am able to give.  As to the costs of Investor and Mr Fardad, I accept that this is a high value case which is very significant to the parties.  Nonetheless, I do not accept that, by drawing attention to the factors it relies on in paragraph 16 of its reply submissions, Investor has established the clear and compelling justification envisaged by Males LJ in Samsung v LG [2022] Costs LR 627 at [6] for hourly rates in material excess of the guideline hourly rates.  That is not to say that it may not do so on a detailed assessment, but whether it will be able to resist a challenge to the reasonableness of the claims it actually makes must be open to real doubt, even when assessed on the indemnity basis: it claims for an hourly rate at c.250% of the guideline rate for the relevant Grade A and B fee earners.  These are huge uplifts and only the claimed rate for a paralegal comes near the guidelines.  Similar issues arise in relation to the costs claimed by the BIG Parties and Mr Vaughan, although in a significantly less pronounced form, because the uplift from the guideline hourly rates is closer to 150%.
The final issue is that the solicitors’ pre-hearing costs for the various applications amount in aggregate to just under £170,000 for Investor and Mr Fardad and to £87,000 for the BIG Parties and Mr Vaughan.  These are very different as between themselves, but quite apart from that, they are very large amounts for a one-day hearing and I am not satisfied that it is possible on a summary assessment properly to test whether their attribution to these applications as opposed to the more general conduct of the litigation has been correctly carried out.
I shall therefore order the costs to be subject to detailed assessment if not agreed.  I must also order a payment on account unless there is good reason not to do so (CPR 44.2(8)).  No good reason is suggested.  In fixing the figure for the payment, the right approach is for the court to estimate the likely level of recovery, subject to an appropriate margin to allow for error in the estimation, per Christopher Clarke LJ in Excalibur Ventures LLC v Texas Keystone Inc [2015] EWHC 566 (Comm) at [23].
In applying this test, I have regard to the factors I have already considered in relation to the question of why a summary assessment is not appropriate, applying where appropriate the standard or the indemnity basis and reflecting to the extent I am able the concerns I have about the extent of the hourly rate uplift.  Bearing in mind that the estimate is by its nature a relatively broad-brush exercise, I have concluded that the following payments on account must be made in relation to the two separate application notices (compounding where appropriate the amounts payable in respect the Petition Amendment Application, the Debarring Application, the Part 7 Amendment Application and the Stay Application):
PWHL must pay TopCo £40,000 in respect of its costs of the Petition Application (c.70% of the amount claimed);
PWHL must pay Mr Vaughan £48,000 in respect of his costs of the Petition Application (c.70% of the amount claimed);
PWHL must pay Mr Fardad £8,000 in respect of his costs of the Petition Application (c.50% of the amount claimed);
PWHL and Mr Waddell must pay the BIG Parties £80,000 in respect of their costs of the Part 7 Application (c.70% of the amount claimed);
PWHL and Mr Waddell must pay Investor £127,000 in respect of its costs of the Part 7 Application (c.55% of the amount claimed).
The parties are to agree and submit for my approval an order to reflect the conclusions I have reached and recorded in this judgment.

Introduction
The Tribunal is asked to determine a preliminary issue common to five separate references concerning the entitlement to compensation of the former owners of four neighbouring plots of land at Eastside in Birmingham.  Each of the sites was acquired by the Secretary of State for Transport in 2018 for the construction of the new Curzon Street terminus for the HS2 railway.
The Eastside Quarter, as it is known, is close to the centre of Birmingham and, had the sites not been acquired, it is likely that they would have been redeveloped for a variety of uses, including commercial, cultural, residential and educational uses.
To support their claims for compensation each of the owners applied to the local planning authority, Birmingham City Council (‘the City Council’) for a certificate of appropriate alternative development under section 17 of the Land Compensation Act 1961.  The purpose of a certificate (or ‘CAAD’) is to determine what planning permissions, if any, could reasonably have been expected to have been obtained for a site if it had not been compulsorily acquired.  The availability of such permissions is significant because in determining the compensation the owner is entitled to receive it must be assumed that planning permission for the certified development was available at the valuation date or would have been available at a future date identified in the certificate (section 14(3), 1961 Act).
Each application was for a separate development on only one of the four adjacent sites but, in conjunction with other uses, each application identified purpose built student accommodation (‘PBSA’) as an appropriate alternative form of development.  As we will explain, Birmingham has a large student population and Eastside is very close to several of its universities; we also anticipate that we will receive evidence in due course that PBSA is a particularly valuable form of development.
As a result of the applications CAADs including an allowance for PBSA were granted by the City Council to Birmingham City University (‘BCU’), Curzon Park Ltd (‘Curzon Park’) and Eastside Partnership Nominee Company Ltd and PMB General Partner Ltd (‘Eastside’).  The Secretary of State has appealed to the Tribunal against those CAADs.
An application by Quintain City Park Gate Ltd (‘Quintain’) and an earlier application by Eastside for CAADs including PBSA were not determined by the City Council within the permitted time and are the subject of appeals against non-determination by the original applicants with the Secretary of State as respondent.
Some sense of the scale of the alternative development which the former owners say would reasonably have been expected on their respective sites can be gained from the certificates granted by the City Council.  Quintain’s certificate is for development of up to 99,490 sqm including residential, office, hotel and retail uses, together with PBSA providing 1,940 bed spaces. Curzon Park’s certificate is for an even larger scheme comprising buildings of up to 41 storeys to a maximum of 181,260 sqm, including up to 37,013 sqm of PBSA providing 1,716 bed spaces.
In each appeal the Secretary of State’s position is that at the relevant valuation date the need for student accommodation in the centre of Birmingham was fully satisfied by the existing supply of PBSA and by other forms of accommodation available to students and that a reasonable planning authority would not have granted planning permission for further PBSA at any of the sites.  The site owners dispute that proposition and maintain that there was a substantial unmet need for PBSA at each valuation date which could have been satisfied by development at Eastside had their land not been acquired for HS2.
The need for further PBSA is therefore an issue common to each of the CAAD appeals.  The parties agreed the terms of a preliminary issue which they invited the Tribunal to determine before it considers the full terms of the appropriate certificate for each site and the amount of compensation payable.
The parties were represented at the hearing by the counsel and solicitors named above.   Expert evidence was given by Mr Martin Hadland MRICS for the Secretary of State, by Mr David Feeney for Quintain, BCU and Eastside, and by Mr Martin Taylor MRTPI for Curzon Park.  We are grateful for the assistance of all who participated.
The preliminary issue
The preliminary issue agreed by the parties is in these terms:
At each of the respective valuation dates, what was the level of planning need for PBSA and how, as a matter of fact, is each site located in terms of distance and travel time from the existing educational establishments (including other student housing)?
The issue is to be determined by reference to the respective valuation dates for the four sites.  Numbering the sites from west to east, the dates on which the interests of the four owners were acquired for HS2 (which are the valuation dates) were as follows:
Site
Owner
Interest
Valuation date
Site 1
Quintain
Leasehold
17 July 2018
Site 2
BCU
Leasehold
16 March 2018
Site 3
Curzon Park
Freehold
30 August 2018
Site 4
Eastside
Freehold
26 September 2018
Although the valuation dates straddle two academic years during which different numbers of students were enrolled and some small differences existed in the amount of accommodation already available or in the development pipeline, the experts agree that circumstances did not change between March and September 2018 to any material extent so the same answer can be given to the preliminary issue for each site.
The experts also reached agreement on the second limb of the preliminary issue concerning distances and travel times between the four sites and eight of the main university centres in the city.  That information is recorded in the experts’ joint statement to which reference can be made at the later stages of the proceedings.
Planning need
The first limb of the preliminary issue invites the Tribunal to determine “the level of planning need for PBSA” at each of the valuation dates.  “Planning need” is not a term of art and no national policy statement explains how it should be assessed when the need in question is for PBSA.  Mr Feeney proposed that planning need for PBSA was simply “the difference between supply and demand”.  Mr Taylor was confident that each of the experts understood what planning need was and used it in the same sense, but as we heard their evidence it seemed to us that the absence of a clear definition was responsible for some of the differences between them.  We therefore asked the parties to agree a definition of planning need which we could apply in our assessment of the evidence.
After completion of the evidence but before making their closing submissions the parties agreed a helpful statement in which they explained that the focus of the preliminary issue is the first bullet point in policy TP33, the City Council’s development plan policy on PBSA, which requires consideration of whether there is “a demonstrated need for the development” (we will come to the Policy in greater detail shortly).  The following propositions were also agreed.
In broad terms, planning need is calculated by comparing demand for and supply of student bedspaces across a geographic area.
The appropriate conclusion of the issue of planning need is numerical.
Planning need relates to the level of need for new PBSA to be met by the proposed development of PBSA on Sites 1-4 (each at its own valuation date).
The reasonable local planning authority applying Policy TP33 would reach a judgment on planning need for PBSA taking into account an estimate of future growth of student demand for PBSA.
Planning need falls to be assessed in the context of the relevant planning policies and guidance as at the valuation dates.
The differences between the three expert witnesses are explained by their disagreement over the following fairly discrete topics, namely:
The relevant geographical area across which any need for PBSA should be assessed.
The relevance of other rented accommodation available to students in determining whether a need for PBSA had been demonstrated (with “HMOs”, houses in multiple occupation, being used as a convenient shorthand for all such accommodation).
The period of time over which any need for PBSA should be assessed, and the length of time over which the potential growth in the number of students requiring accommodation should be considered.
To a lesser extent, the rate of growth which should be applied to the number of students requiring accommodation.
Whether a reasonable planning authority would use publicly available data on student numbers and accommodation choices or would have regard to a more detailed version of the same data available only under commercial licence.
Despite their best efforts to clarify what they mean by planning need, it can be seen that the parties’ agreed explanation begs important questions, in particular about the area within which, and the period over which, the relevant need must be established, but also about whether the relevant supply and demand for student bedspaces are for spaces within PBSA or extend to other types of accommodation, including HMOs. With the benefit of hindsight, it might have been preferable for us to have been asked to consider whether the relevant policy as a whole was satisfied, rather than to address only one of its components, but we will do our best within the limits of the evidence to provide a useful answer to the preliminary issue.
The Tribunal’s task
The legal framework for the preliminary issue is provided by sections 14, 17 and 18 of the Land Compensation Act 1961. In assessing the value of land for the purpose of determining the amount of compensation payable for its compulsory acquisition, section 14(3) provides that it may be assumed that planning permission was in force on the valuation date for any development that is appropriate alternative development, as defined in section 14(4).  That is, development for which, on the assumptions in section 14(5) but otherwise in the circumstances known to the market on the valuation date, planning permission could reasonably have been expected to be granted on an application determined on or after the valuation date.
As far as they are relevant to these appeals, the assumptions required to be made by section 14(5) are that the scheme underlying the acquisition had been cancelled on the launch date (which in these cases is agreed to have been 25 November 2013), that no action has been taken by the acquiring authority wholly or mainly for the purposes of the scheme, and that there is no prospect of the same scheme, or any other project to meet the same or substantially the same need, being carried out in the exercise of a statutory function, or by the exercise of compulsory purchase powers.
Section 17 enables the acquiring authority or the landowner to apply to the local planning authority for a CAAD stating that there is, or is not, development that is appropriate alternative development in relation to the land acquired and describing it.  Section 18(1) provides a right of appeal to the Tribunal.
On any appeal under section 18, the Tribunal must consider the matters to which the certificate relates as if the application had been made to it in the first place, and must confirm, vary, or cancel the certificate and issue a different certificate in its place as it considers appropriate (section 18(2)).
As Lewison LJ explained in Leech Homes Ltd v Northumberland County Council [2021] EWCA Civ 198, at [21], the direction to proceed as though the application for a certificate had been made to the Tribunal in the first place means that we are “exercising an original jurisdiction rather than a review jurisdiction”.  In the same paragraph the learned Lord Justice approved what we had previously said about the Tribunal’s role in the same case at first instance ([2020] UKUT 150 (LC)):
""… when considering under s.14(4)(b) whether planning permission for the appellant's scheme could reasonably have been expected to be granted at the valuation date, or later, the Tribunal is not required to ask itself how Northumberland County Council is likely to have determined the notional application for consent. The Tribunal must put itself in the position of a reasonable decision maker, properly applying the law. It follows that, if at the statutory valuation date the County Council's officers and members had a particular understanding of the meaning of a relevant planning policy, the Tribunal is not required to adopt that understanding or to interpret the policy in the same way, but must decide for itself what the policy means, and apply it correctly.""
We must determine the preliminary issue applying ordinary planning principles.  These require that we have regard to the development plan, so far as material, and make our determination in accordance with the plan unless material considerations indicate otherwise (section 38(6), Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004).  As the Tribunal (George Bartlett QC, President) suggested in Urban Edge Group Ltd v London Underground Ltd [2009] UKUT 103 (LC), at [50], in making our determination “evidence of actual decisions made by the planning authority will be relevant and no doubt persuasive”.   The Supreme Court has made clear at an earlier stage in these proceedings that if we consider that the City Council’s own decisions on any of the CAAD applications are of assistance on the question of whether planning permission could reasonably have been expected to be granted, we are not prevented by the assumptions required by section 14(5) from taking those decisions into account (Secretary of State for Transport v Curzon Park Ltd & Ors [2023] UKSC 30, at [60]-[61]).
Higher education in Birmingham
Birmingham has a flourishing higher education sector and is home to seven institutions with university status:  Aston University (‘Aston’), The University of Birmingham (‘UoB’), University College Birmingham (‘UCB’), Newman University (‘Newman’), Birmingham City University (‘BCU’), the University of Law, and BPP University.  The last two mentioned are the Birmingham campuses of larger institutions and the evidence which we heard left them out of account in assessing the need for PBSA because separate data was not available and because any difference they might make was thought to be nominal.
In addition to its universities, Birmingham has a large further education sector comprising FE and sixth form colleges.  The student housing needs of these institutions were also left out of account both because of a lack of data and on the basis that most of their students reside in their parental home while pursuing further education.
The five principal universities are located in three main centres.  The main campuses of Aston, UCB, and BCU are located in the City centre itself; Aston and BCU adjoin each other immediately to the north of the Eastside Quarter, while UCB is further to the west.  Also in the City centre, but apart from the main cluster are BCU’s School of Art and School of Jewellery.
UoB is at Edgbaston on the south side of the City.  Also to the south, but closer to the City centre, is BCU’s smaller City South campus.
Finally, Newman, the smallest of the five institutions, is a further 10km southwest of UoB, almost on the fringe of the City.  There was agreement that its students do not contribute significantly to the need for PBSA in the City, as most live at home.  They therefore tended to be omitted from assessments of demand.
The Birmingham Development Plan published in January 2017 recorded that the City’s five main universities were attended by around 72,000 students.  This figure is rather higher than the total of 65,795 recorded by the Higher Education Statistics Agency (‘HESA’) (a standalone agency at the valuation dates, since merged into ‘Jisc’, the Joint Information Systems Committee) but we assume the difference is accounted for by part time students who are omitted from the HESA figures and from the calculations of the expert witnesses.
The policy context
The preliminary issue falls to be considered in the context of national and local planning policy and guidance in 2018.
National policy
The National Planning Policy Framework (‘NPPF’) had little specifically to say about student housing either in its original form in force for the two earlier valuation dates or as revised with effect from 24 July 2018.  We were reminded of the general presumption in favour of sustainable development and of its importance for both the plan making and development control aspects of the work of a local planning authority.  The policy framework directed that the needs of groups with specific housing requirements were to be addressed in the context of the wider objective of significantly boosting the supply of homes (paragraph 59), and that the size, type and tenure of housing needed for different groups, including students, should be assessed and reflected in planning policies (paragraph 61).
Strategic policy-making authorities (which include the City Council) were required to establish a housing requirement figure for their whole area, showing the extent to which their housing need could be met over the plan period (paragraph 65).
More specific guidance on the assessment of housing and economic development needs was provided in Planning Practice Guidance (PPG) which supported the NPPF.   As far as housing is concerned the document (and a revision of 13 September 2018) usefully explained that the objective of identifying need in this context is to identify the future quantity of housing needed, including a breakdown by type, tenure and size.  “Need” was to be assessed over the plan period and should consider “future scenarios that could be reasonably expected to occur”.  Plan makers were advised to examine current and future trends in demographic factors, types of households, housing stock and tenure. Authorities were encouraged to plan for sufficient student accommodation, and in that context attention was drawn to housing provided by private landlords. The PPG acknowledged a relationship between the housing needs of students and those of the wider population and suggested at ID2a-021 that, by releasing properties in the private rented sector, the provision of PBSA might contribute to satisfying general housing targets:
“Encouraging more dedicated student accommodation may provide low cost housing that takes pressure off the private rented sector and increases the overall housing stock.”
Although this observation was addressed to plan makers, Mr Taylor (Curzon Park’s expert witness) regarded it as material to the assessment of housing need generally.  We agree and note that the same relationship between PBSA and the general housing market is a theme in the supporting text to Policy TP33 and in the City Council’s November 2019 report on supply and demand in student accommodation, which we were encouraged by the Secretary of State to adopt as a correct statement of how Policy TP33 should be applied in decision making.
The PPG also recognised that housing or economic needs are rarely constrained by local authority administrative boundaries, and that their assessment might therefore require coordination between several planning authorities or focus on smaller areas within the boundaries of a single authority.  In answer to the question ‘What areas should be assessed?’, it advised that:
“needs should be addressed to the relevant functional area, ie housing market area… Establishing the assessment area may identify smaller sub-markets with specific features, and it may be appropriate to investigate these specifically in order to create a detailed picture of local need.”
The Development Plan
The local plan, the Birmingham Development Plan was relatively new in 2018, having been adopted by the City Council in January 2017, and runs until 2031.  It includes a specific policy concerning PBSA.  Policy TP33 is in these terms:
""Proposals for purpose built student accommodation provided on campus will be supported in principle subject to satisfying design and amenity considerations. Proposals for off campus provision will be considered favourably where:
 There is demonstrated need for the development
 The proposed development is very well located in relation to the educational establishment that it is to serve and to the local facilities which will serve it, by means of walking, cycling and public transport
 The proposed development will not have an unacceptable impact on the local neighbourhood and residential amenity
 The scale, massing and architecture of the development is appropriate for the location
 The design and layout of the accommodation together with the associated facilities provided will create a safe, secure and welcoming living environment.""
It will be seen that the policy distinguishes between accommodation to be provided on campus, which is to be supported in principle, and accommodation off campus, which will be considered favourably where there is a demonstrated need for the development and subject to the satisfaction of the other criteria identified in the policy.  There is an issue in the BCU appeal about the meaning of “on campus” in this context, as the land which it owned at Eastside is within eight minutes’ walk of its main Parkside building.  That is an issue for another day.
Text supporting Policy TP33 draws attention to the size of the City’s higher and further education sectors and places importance on the growth of the universities and their role in stimulating the business sector.  The City Council expressed a wish “to ensure that there is a sufficient supply of good quality accommodation which meets the needs of all members of the student community, which is provided in a suitable and sustainable location, is well designed and provides a high quality living experience in attractive buildings which enhance the local area.”  In view of that statement, and the language of the policy as a whole, we do not accept Mr Williams KC’s description of TP33 as “restrictive” so far as off-campus PBSA is concerned; the policy seems to us to be more affirming or receptive than that.  Provided the relevant conditions are met, including a demonstrable need, proposals for off campus provision will be considered favourably.
It is convenient at this point to deal shortly with Mr Hadland’s evidence that the first and second bullet points of the policy are connected.  The explanation of that connection in his original report seemed to be that the policy required that a need be demonstrated in relation to a particular university, which may read more into the policy than is justified.  In his later report Mr Hadland distanced himself from this position, confirming in cross-examination that nothing in his evidence should be taken as relevant to compliance with the second bullet point (which concerns proximity).   In their agreed note on “planning need” the parties confirmed that they did not wish the Tribunal to reach a conclusion on how well located the four sites are at this stage, and we have heard no evidence directed specifically to that issue other than the raw data agreed between the parties in response to the second limb of the preliminary issue.  We will therefore approach the assessment of the need for PBSA without considering the second TP33 bullet point.
Student accommodation was of course only one small part of the development plan.  Policy PG1 set the wider context by recognising that the City Council’s objectively assessed housing need over the period to 2031 was for 89,000 additional homes, of which only 51,100 were planned for within the plan period.  The policy acknowledged that it was not possible to deliver the 37,900 shortfall within the City boundary.
The striking discrepancy between the City’s general need for housing and its capacity to meet it is relevant to our assessment of the need for PBSA.  We have previously seen that the relationship between the housing needs of the general population and the needs of students is recognised in the PPG which supports the NPPF. The same relationship is identified in the supporting text to policy TP33 which explains that student households are included in the City's general housing requirement and when student accommodation is provided as self-contained studio apartments or clusters it counts towards meeting the City's housing requirement. The City Council explained that it would therefore continue to monitor the development of PBSA and its contribution to meeting the City's housing requirement.  That is a further indication that the City’s general orientation towards PBSA was favourable.
The Strategic Housing Land Availability Assessment
The potential for PBSA to take pressure off the supply of general needs housing and to contribute to meeting the City’s housing requirement was recognised again in the City Council’s annual Strategic Housing Land Availability Assessment (“SHLAA”).  Mr Williams KC correctly cautioned that the SHLAA is not, in itself, a decision-making document, but it is nevertheless a formal document required by national planning policy, which explains how a local planning authority intends to meet its housing requirements.
The July 2018 SHLAA, published a year after the development plan was adopted, acknowledged that a significant amount of housing demand originated from the City’s large student population. It included an assessment of the number of students on full-time courses at the City’s universities, which was 66,217, of whom around 44% were not in need of “bespoke accommodation” because, for example, they lived at their own or a parental home.  These figures were said to give rise to a “minimum demand for bespoke accommodation of around 36,892 bed spaces”.  By “bespoke accommodation” we understand the authors to mean PBSA and not simply accommodation of any type. To meet that demand the City currently had around 21,811 bed spaces in PBSA with a further 5,518 in the pipeline.  The SHLAA confirmed that the ‘pipeline’ figure of 5,518 PBSA bedspaces comprised 3,104 bedspaces in 1,464 flats or apartments which were already under construction, plus a further 2,414 bedspaces in 926 units for which permission had been granted.
Mr Hadland accepted that the SHLAA appeared to indicate that in July 2018 BCC considered there was a shortfall of around 15,000 bedspaces before any pipeline was considered.
The document then noted once again that student households are included in the City’s general housing requirement and that student accommodation can be included towards meeting that requirement, based on the amount of accommodation it releases in the housing market.  It provided the following assessment of how much accommodation might be released for general use by the provision of additional PBSA:
In 2016/17, the most recent year for which information is available, there were 15,280 students residing in “other rented” /HMO accommodation which could be released to the general housing market through the provision of additional purpose built accommodation. The number of bed spaces in the “other rented”/HMO properties varies. In the city centre many students rent single bed apartments while family homes are more frequently occupied by students elsewhere. A dwelling in the general housing market can therefore be freed up through the provision of a purpose built, one person apartment or a cluster flat containing five, six or more bed spaces. The city council's approach is, therefore, to count self-contained units of accommodation not bed spaces despite this significantly undercounting the number of students being accommodated.”
The thrust of policy, both in the PPG and in the SHLAA, appears therefore to have viewed PBSA as a means of encouraging the release of student HMO accommodation to meet general housing needs.  No target was set or projection made, nor did TP33 mention this as an objective, but, encouraged by national policy, BCC certainly appears to have regarded the release of housing to the general market as a desirable byproduct of the development of additional PBSA.
The City Council was obviously conscious that a significant portion of the student population did not live at home, on campus, or in “bespoke accommodation” and was accommodated instead in “other rented” accommodation, which included HMOs.  It was also alive to the risks of over-concentration of students in particular areas, especially those popular with University of Birmingham students.  Long before the publication of the development plan or the 2018 SHLAA the City Council had given itself power to ameliorate those risks.  In parts of Selly Oak, Edgbaston and Harborne to the south and west of the University of Birmingham, an Article 4 direction removed permitted development rights in November 2014 preventing any change from a use class C3 dwellinghouse to a class C4 HMO without planning permission.
This direction did not have retrospective effect and we do not see it as part of any wider strategy to make a proportion of student occupied HMOs available to meet general housing need. It was partly for this reason that Mr Hadland did not treat HMO accommodation as a source of future supply.  On the other hand, by creating an obstacle to a further proliferation of HMOs the direction was supportive of the City Council’s ambition to encourage a supply of good quality, well designed accommodation in attractive buildings in suitable and sustainable locations.
How the City Council applied its own policy
In the months around the valuation dates and after, the City Council granted several planning permissions for PBSA.  Each application was supported by a needs assessment intended to satisfy the requirements of policy TP33.  It also granted the four CAADs which are the subject of these appeals by the Secretary of State.  As we have already explained, in deciding whether planning permission could reasonably have been expected to be granted for PBSA, we are entitled to have regard to those decisions.
In chronological order, these were as follows.
In April 2017, planning permission was granted for a 6-7 storey PBSA development accommodating 102 bedspaces on the corner of Cheapside and Moseley Road, Digbeth. The development was specifically to cater for students of the South and City College whose permanent residence was outside the city.   The experts placed no weight on this small, bespoke application.
In January 2018, planning permission was granted for 290 bedspaces at the ‘Nautical Club’, 3-4 Bishopsgate Street in the Five Ways area of the City centre. The application was supported by a needs assessment by Savills dated October 2017.   The officer’s report to the Planning Committee noted that the City’s full time student population had been growing “strongly and consistently” over the past couple of decades and stood at 63,000.  Reference was made to 5,582 bed spaces in the pipeline before officers commented:
“Using the 2015/16 student population and assuming that every single bed in the pipeline comes forward, the student to bed ratio will become 2.2 (i.e. 2.2 students per bed space).  Although not every student will need accommodation, it is still considered that there is scope for more purpose built student accommodation in the City Centre.”
Two months later, in March 2018, planning permission was granted for 1,023 bedspaces at Vesey Street, another central location close to Aston University.  The application was supported by an October 2017 needs survey prepared by wyg.   The officer’s report of 1 March saw no reason to disagree with that assessment which suggested that only 50% of the full time students of Aston and BCU would have access to purpose built accommodation and that additional student accommodation was needed.  Despite previous approvals on the site for student accommodation, and the presence of other PBSA in the immediate vicinity the officer agreed with “strategic colleagues” that the principle of student accommodation was acceptable in that location.
Also in March 2018 permission was granted for 399 bedspaces at Upper Dean Street in the City centre, a little to the southwest of Eastside. The application included reports on the Birmingham student market prepared by Knight Frank in 2014 and December 2017.  The officer’s report for the committee noted that permission had previously been granted for PBSA on the site in 2015, before the Development Plan had been adopted.   The updated assessment was said to show an undersupply of PBSA with only 20% of the City’s full time student population being offered PBSA accommodation.  The officer advised that the proposal would comply with policy TP33 and was acceptable in principle.
The Nautical Club, Vesey Street and Upper Dean Street planning permissions were all granted before the first of our valuation dates, for BCU’s site, which falls on 16 March 2018, the day after the planning committee meeting approved the Upper Dean Street.  In aggregate, 1,712 PBSA bedspaces were consented by BCC in the first three months of 2018.
The following month, planning permission was granted in April 2018 for up to 61 studio apartments over six storeys at 168 Bridge Street West, a location to the north of the City centre, outside the inner ring road.  The application was supported by a needs assessment dated September 2017 by ‘Student Tenant Find’, and a CBRE report – ‘Birmingham Student Supply and Demand’.  The needs assessment concluded that even after taking account of pipeline PBSA bed spaces approximately 21% of the student population could not be accommodated in PBSA, and that additional accommodation was therefore required. The officer’s report for the 12 April 2018 committee meeting accepted that there remained a current need for PBSA whilst not necessarily accepting the specific figures identified in the needs assessment.
The valuation dates for the Quintain, Curzon Park, and Eastside references fall next in the chronology on 17 July, 30 August, and 26 September 2018.
In October 2018, planning permission was granted for 556 bedspaces at Lancaster Street under reference 2018/08221/PA.  We have little detail of this application, which was referred to at paragraph 5.27 of the officer’s report for the BCU CAAD, which we discuss below.
The Quintain CAAD(s)
BCC failed to determine Quintain’s CAAD application of 11 February 2019 within the required two-month period, but it did issue a Certificate (‘the purported Quintain CAAD’) on 29 May 2019.  Included as AAD were 52,147 sqm of student accommodation, or 1,940 bed spaces, in a development of up to 99,490 sqm.   The purported Quintain CAAD is subject to appeal by the Secretary of State.
The officer’s report of 23 May 2019, recommending the grant of the requested certificate, said this:
Considering the period after the relevant date (2018-July-17), there have been applications for in excess of 1000 student bed spaces across the City, with one scheme approved in October providing some 556 spaces within the City Centre. Given that the development would likely be a multi-phase scheme progressing over a number of years, coupled with the City’s support of the expansion of the City’s universities (BDP TP36), it is reasonable to assume that significant further expansion of the student residential offer would be required. Eastside is ideally located for two of the City’s key universities and its continued focus as a learning quarter is supported in policy. Therefore, subject to the amenity, design and highway considerations … at the relevant date it is likely that the principle of student residential could have been satisfactorily demonstrated.”
The Curzon Park CAAD
Curzon Park’s application for a CAAD was made on 18 April 2019, resulting in a certificate dated 18 June 2019.    This certified that up to 181,260 sqm of mixed-use space would be appropriate alternative development, including 37,013 sqm of PBSA.
The officer’s report of 18 June 2019 was in similar terms to that prepared for the Quintain CAAD.
The BCU CAAD
On 21 December 2018, BCU made an application for a CAAD for its site, in which it sought confirmation that 88,829 sqm of mixed-use development was appropriate alternative development, including 66,187 sqm (2,279 bedspaces) of PBSA.  On 31 July 2019 BCC granted the certificate.
The officer’s report dated 18 July 2019 said this:
In terms of quantum, the proposal clearly represents a significant number of student bed spaces. To show a need the applicant has submitted evidence to demonstrate rising demand for student accommodation to serve BCU leaving a shortfall in 2020/21. There has been a significant growth in the development of PBSA, particularly in and around Birmingham City Centre. Between 1 April [2018] and 31 March 2019 a total of 1,166 student bedspaces have been completed in the city centre. At April 2019 2,667 bedspaces were under construction and a further 658 bedspaces have planning permission but are not yet started. The existing available supply of student accommodation in the city centre (including this 2018/19 completions) is 13,915 (University and private student accommodation). If all accommodation under construction and not yet started was built out the supply of bedspaces could reach 17,240.
Furthermore, members will also recall that a positive CAAD was issued for the [Quintain] site confirming that on 2018-July-17 a total of 1,940 bed spaces could reasonably have been expected to gain planning consent on the adjacent site.
As such, … at the relevant date it is likely that the principle of student residential would have been supported as proposed.”
The November 2019 officers’ report to the planning committee
The Council received more detailed and considered advice from its officers on the application of Policy TP33 in a report to its planning committee dated 21 November 2019.  Headed “student accommodation supply and demand”, the report provided relevant background information and clarified the evidence which officers considered was needed to provide ‘an up to date demonstration of the need for any development’.
Mr Williams KC submitted that the advice contained in the November 2019 report properly interpreted and applied Policy TP33 and he invited us to adopt the same approach.  He suggested that the report supported the position taken by Mr Hadland on each of the issues which divided the experts.  We will consider whether that suggestion is correct when we deal with those issues.
The assessments of demand in the report were taken from the publicly available HESA data for 2017/18.  The supply of accommodation was analysed both by reference to the city as a whole and by reference to sub-areas, the largest of which were the city centre and Selly Oak/ Edgbaston.  The report’s broad conclusions noted the increase in demand over the previous 10 years and advised that demand was set to increase over the next 5 years if the universities’ future growth plans were implemented.  Based on the total number of students requiring accommodation, but without distinguishing between different types of accommodation, and comparing that figure to the total supply of PBSA (existing, under construction and consented) the report concluded that there was an overall deficit of 8,837 PBSA bedspaces in the city.  This PBSA deficit, or “residual demand” as the authors described it, was currently being satisfied by other types of accommodation (specifically HMOs, although that was shorthand for rented accommodation which was not PBSA or provided by the universities themselves).  Interestingly, the analysis in the paper was expressly predicated on the assumption that all current and future potential demand for student accommodation would be for PBSA rather than for HMOs in the private rented sector.  Because there was sufficient accommodation in the City to house all students, any new PBSA would primarily be to serve a growth in student numbers, to rectify a mismatch in the type of accommodation which is available and that which is needed, to respond to changing student preferences or to replace existing PBSA.
The report included an appendix which recommended information which should be provided to demonstrate a need for PBSA.  It was suggested that this evidence should be specific both as to the university to be served by a proposed development, the particular subset of students who were to be accommodated and as to area, so evidence about the overall student population or city wider need alone would not be sufficient.   This advice may be contrasted with the needs assessments provided to support the applications for PBSA consents to which we have previously referred which were largely based on city-wide needs assessments.
It was emphasised by Mr Pereira KC that the November 2019 report would not have been known to the market at any of the valuation dates, some 14-16 months previously. That is obviously correct, but it does not seem to us to be an obstacle to reliance being placed on it for the purposes suggested by Mr Williams KC.  We are not concerned at this stage with market perception, but with the interpretation of policy TP33 and the evidence required to demonstrate the need referred to in its first bullet point.  We are in the position of a decision maker at the valuation date asked to determine whether planning permission should be granted for PBSA.  An interpretation of its own policy which the planning committee adopted in 2019 might also have been a correct approach at an early date, whether it was applied in decisions made at that earlier date or not.  If we are satisfied that it is the correct interpretation of Policy TP33 we should adopt it whether or not it was the approach being taken at around the valuation date.
The Eastside CAAD
The City Council failed to determine Eastside’s first CAAD application of 22 February 2019 (for 44,000 sqm including 1,105 student bedspaces) within the required two-month period, Eastside made a second application on 18 November 2019, which sought confirmation that up to 30,143 sqm of mixed use space would be appropriate alternative development. The City Council issued a CAAD on 16 January 2020 for a maximum of 30,747 sqm including 24,870 sqm of student accommodation, or 871 bed spaces.   This Certificate is also subject to appeal by the Secretary of State.
The officer’s report of 7 January 2020 was quite categoric in its assessment of the need for PBSA and said this:
Considering the period after the relevant date (2018-September-26), consent has been granted for Purpose Built Student Accommodation (PBSA), including a development sited close to the proposals (365 bedspaces, reference 2018/10465/PA). [HESA] data shows that the overall demand for accommodation in Birmingham was 36,218 bedspaces in 2017/18. With the number of students expected to increase over the next 5-10 years there is clearly a demand for student accommodation and given the growing presence of education establishments in the city centre there is a need for PBSA. Eastside is ideally located for two of the City’s key universities and its continued focus as a learning quarter is supported in policy. Therefore, subject to the amenity, design and highway considerations …at the relevant date it is likely that the principle of student residential would have been supported as proposed.”
(The development for 365 bedspaces under reference 2018/10465/PA has not been further referred to in the evidence.)
Clearly in the first half of 2018, the Council was willing to grant permission for PBSA, being satisfied that there was a demonstrable need, and that the requirements in TP33 were being met by evidence of an existing city wide demand for student accommodation coupled with the expectation of growth in the institutions closest to the application site.
The officer’s report granting the Quintain, Curzon and BCU CAADs, in the summer of 2019 can, we think, fairly be taken to indicate how the Council was applying its own policy at the valuation dates in March to August 2018.
Although the November 2019 report was more demanding in terms of the evidence which would be required to support an application for PBSA, it has not been shown to have reduced the Council’s perception of need, which the Eastside CAAD suggests had not changed.
That sets the scene by showing how BCC was treating applications for PBSA between April 2017 and January 2020.  We will now consider how the experts assessed the need for PBSA in 2018.
The experts’ approaches
Each expert arrived at a variety of quantitative measures of PBSA need by deducting from a calculated demand pool the actual or assumed supply of bedspaces. In some instances, this included growth in demand, and growth in supply - PBSA in the ‘pipeline’ (schemes under construction or having planning permission at the valuation dates).
To summarise the views of the three experts, Mr Hadland, for the Secretary of State, believed that there was no demonstrated need for PBSA in 2018, while Mr Taylor for Curzon Park calculated that there would be a need for 21,300 – 22,700 bedspaces by the year 2031, and Mr Feeney for Quintain, Eastside and BCU assessed a need for 22,666 bedspaces in 2016/17 and 21,433 in 2018/19.
Supply
Helpfully, the position as to supply of PBSA bed spaces was uncontroversial.  The experts agreed that in the 2016/17 academic year, there were 20,849 operational bedspaces available across the city, and in 2017/18 there were 22,082.  Both figures included 305 bedspaces at Newman (which did not grow between the two years). They also calculated the ‘pipeline’ – by adding the beds to be provided in developments that were under construction or subject to an extant planning permission but subtracting any beds in developments that were known to be closing ahead of the next academic year (BCU’s Oakmount and Westmount sites).  The pipeline at the BCU valuation date of March 2018 was 5,333. Before the other three valuation dates, planning permission was granted for 61 further beds at 168 Bridge Street West, bringing the pipeline up to 5,394.
The total city wide PBSA bedspaces, including pipeline, were therefore 27,415 at the BCU valuation date, and 27,476 at the later dates.  For ease, we will use the higher figure from hereon, but nothing material turns on us doing so.
The agreed supply of PBSA within the city centre was 12,406 bedspaces, with 4,494 in the pipeline, totalling 16,900.
There was disagreement about whether HMOs and other rented accommodation which was not PBSA should be included in the assessment of supply, but we will return to that topic separately.
Demand
In assessing demand, the experts each referred to data published by HESA based on its survey of the accommodation students reported they were living in at the start of the relevant academic years.  Unfortunately the experts did not refer to the same data.  HESA makes its raw data publicly available without charge, but for a fee it also offers licenced commercial subscribers access to a more detailed version of the same survey results, containing additional information and allowing more sophisticated analysis.     Mr Hadland and Mr Taylor used the public data to assess the number of students who were likely to require PBSA – what might be termed a ‘bottom up’ approach.
Mr Feeney considered the public HESA data to be unreliable, and preferred to use the licensed data set, but he provided evidence using both sources to allow comparison with the other experts’ assessments. He started with the total number of students and deducted those students whom he considered were unlikely to require PBSA – a ‘top down’ approach.
The HESA data is based on a survey of all students in higher education at the start of the academic year.  It is completed by students themselves, and it was common ground that the questions which they are asked are ambiguous with the result that the raw data is not always reliable.  It has been described by researchers at Sheffield Hallam University as unreliable (although they also described it is as ‘the best available measure of a student’s housing type in their first year and at least acts as proxy to identifying those students (a) living with their parents, and (b) maintaining their own home.’).
The main difference between the two versions of the HESA data is that the commercial product provides details missing from the publicly available material including, in particular, information about each student’s home postcode.  This, Mr Feeney said, allowed a more detailed level of analysis stripping out certain groups of students.  He had used the licenced data in every planning needs assessment he had carried out in the last 15 years.
At the start of Mr Hadland’s evidence, he said that in all the work his practice had done, they had ‘never been asked to purchase, or to use, any commercial data available from HESA, and as a practice we have never purchased it’.   We initially took this to mean that he preferred not to use the commercially available data, either because he did not think it was necessary to do so or because it was not reliable. But at the end of his evidence, in answer to questions from us, he clarified his position.  He explained that while he had never been asked by clients or planning officers to use it, he and his firm spent many hours ‘tidying up’ the HESA data by reference to postcodes, and that as regards the licenced HESA data, he had used it but had never bought it.  Contrary to our initial impression he regularly used the licenced version in his work for universities, and confirmed that if it were available, he would use it.  He accepted that if he were in the position of the Tribunal, standing proxy for a reasonable planning authority, and was presented with the licensed data, he would have regard to it.
Local planning authorities do seem to base decisions on the need for PBSA on the public HESA data, and it appears on many occasions the City Council have done so.  However, based on the evidence and Mr Hadland’s clarification, putting ourselves in the shoes of the reasonable planning authority, given that the licenced HESA data is in evidence and available to us, we should have regard to it.
The limitations of the public data set became apparent during the evidence.  As Mr Taylor pointed out, it suggested that in 2016/17 there were 16,100 students in PBSA, implying an unrealistically low occupancy rate of 73%, based on 22,082 beds being available that year.   Mr Feeney agreed, noting that Unite Students was reporting an occupancy rate of around 98%.
The publicly available HESA data showed that students attending the five main universities reported that they were living in the following subcategories of accommodation at the start of the 2016/17 academic year.  There are rounding and summation errors in the data, but adjusted for these as best we can, the figures are as follows:

Mr Hadland’s assessment of PBSA need
Mr Taylor calculated the demand pool for PBSA by aggregating students in ‘provider-maintained property’, ‘private sector halls’, ‘other rented accommodation’, ‘other’, and all the ‘not knowns’.   These totalled 36,885 students, or 56% of the total.  Mr Hadland applied a similar approach but apportioned the ‘not knowns’ pro-rata to the other categories, coming to 35,462.  Mr Feeney said he would also include all of the ‘not knowns’, but the resulting difference is marginal.
The experts made different assumptions about growth and the rate and period over which it should be assessed.  Mr Hadland’s method of calculating demand for PBSA was to allow for growth over five years from 2016/17 (thus, four years from the valuation dates) using the historic growth figures extrapolated forward, but to balance this, on the supply side he included the ‘pipeline’ of PBSA beds due to come on stream.  Mr Taylor did the same, but accounted for growth until 2031, the end of the local plan period.  We deal with growth in more detail later.
While all three experts provided evidence on both a city-wide and a sub-market approach, Mr Hadland’s preference was to restrict the demand pool to students living in the city centre who were attending BCU, Aston, and UCB, adding some students from UoB who resided in the city centre. Mr Feeney and Mr Taylor consider a city-wide approach to be more appropriate.
Using the public HESA data for 2016/17 Mr Hadland calculated the demand pool for PBSA in the city centre for 2016/17, and 2021/22 (assuming a growth rate between those years of 17.9% for Aston, BCU and UCB, and 17.1% for UoB). He then added the remaining UoB students to come to a city-wide demand pool, as follows:
2016/17
2021/22

5,687
6,705

18,534
UoB (other)
20,034
23,460
Total (city wide)
35,733
41,994
The agreed supply of PBSA within the city centre was 12,406 bedspaces, with 4,494 in the pipeline, totalling 16,900.  Mr Hadland was sure that HMOs should be added to this supply, effectively eliminating any need for additional PBSA.  If that assumption is not made, Mr Hadland’s figures show a 2021/22 city centre PBSA shortfall of 1,634 beds (18,534 – 16,900).
As regards the UoB sub-area alone, comparing the 2021/22 demand pool of 23,460 students with the agreed supply of 10,271 bedspaces (9,371 operational beds excluding HMOs, plus 900 in the pipeline) produces a shortfall of 13,189 bedspaces.
On Mr Hadland’s figures, the total shortfall across the city, therefore, was 14,823 bedspaces by 2021/22 if (contrary to his view) HMOs are discounted.
Including HMOs, which Mr Hadland initially calculated as numbering 5,395 (Footnote: 1) in the city centre, and 10,853 in his UoB sub-market, the city centre would have an over-supply of 3,761 bedspaces (the demand from 18,534 students being met by a supply of 22,295 bedspaces).  The UoB sub-market would have a shortfall of 2,336, (demand of 23,460 being only partially met by supply of 21,124).  City-wide there would therefore have been a net oversupply of 1,425 bedspaces.
Mr Taylor’s assessment of PBSA need
Mr Taylor’s approach differed from that of Mr Hadland in several ways.  First, he included Newman in his city-wide calculations. Secondly, he made a deduction of 3% to the supply figure to allow for flexibility, in-year moves etc.  Thirdly, while using a similar growth rate to Mr Hadland’s, he projected growth in demand to the end of the development plan period in 2031 and stressed that this growth projection was a minimum and would likely be higher.
Using alternative growth figures from the previous five and ten years, Mr Taylor projected that by 2031, the number of students in the city centre institutions could reach between 56,651 and 57,928; while both growth figures suggested around 102,000 students across the whole of Birmingham.
Applying his 3% reduction to the total supply figures, Mr Taylor projected an available supply of bedspaces by 2031, including pipeline, of 26,652 across the city, of which 16,393 would be in the city centre sub-area.
Mr Taylor assumed a demand pool equal to just under 56% of total student numbers based on the current proportion of students who could be in need of PBSA. He therefore calculated a city-wide shortfall of between 29,486 and 29,606 bedspaces by 2031 depending on which growth figure was adopted.  If the need analysis was carried out on a university by university basis, the shortfall would increase to between 29,571 and 30,852 bedspaces across Birmingham.
Repeating the exercise for the city centre, using the average growth rate, a shortfall of between 6,692 and 7,219 bedspaces by 2031 was arrived at.  However, if growth were applied on a university basis, Aston’s higher growth rate pushes the city centre shortfall up to 8,613.
Mr Taylor then carried out a sensitivity analysis to account for HMOs (including other rented accommodation), which the HESA data suggested were home to around 14% of students.   This ranged from an assumption that all those students in HMOs in 2016/17 would remain there (a ‘0% market shift’), through to all students moving to PBSA (a ‘100% market shift’). The latter assumption would leave all of Mr Taylor’s conclusions above unchanged.  But even if the proportion of students housed in HMOs remained unchanged by 2031, Mr Taylor calculated that there would still be a shortfall of around 13,000 bedspaces across the city, and a shortfall of between 1,827 and 2,254 in the city centre submarket.
He considered it appropriate to add 50% of the number of students currently housed in HMOs to his demand pool, thus arriving at a need for PBSA by 2031 of 21,300 to 22,700 bedspaces across the city, of which between 4,300 to 6,200 would be in the city centre sub-area.
Mr Taylor noted that while 44.5% of students from the UK are currently housed in PBSA or in other rented accommodation the proportion of overseas students in those forms of accommodation is notably higher at 66.7%.  He therefore suggested that if the universities succeed in their ambition of attracting a higher proportion of international students to Birmingham, the need for PBSA would be likely to increase.  He also thought that a proportion of the 10,250 ‘own residence’ students, which the HESA data did not break down, might also be included in PBSA need.  For these reasons, Mr Taylor said his projected PBSA shortfall figures should be considered as a minimum.
Mr Feeney’s assessment of PBSA need using the public HESA data
Given that the two other experts had assessed demand using the public HESA data, Mr Feeney helpfully provided two calculations using the same material (noting that he considered the public data unreliable).   On that basis he calculated 2016/17 demand pools of 38,015 students city-wide, and 15,900 for the city centre.
City wide, Mr Feeney compared his demand pool with the agreed supply figures for 2016/17 (20,849) and 2017/18 (22,082), to arrive at PBSA shortfalls of 17,166 and 15,933 respectively.
For the city centre, he compared his demand pool with a supply figure of 9,356 to arrive at shortfalls of 6,504 and 5,980 for the two years.
In his first report, Mr Feeney did not account for growth, saying that it was not his practice to do so in preparing planning need reports, so his 2017/18 figure might be too low because it compared 2016/17 demand with 2017/18 supply, but neither did he account for pipeline supply.  He also made no allowance for HMOs.
We can now summarise the views of the experts based on the public HESA data:
Mr Feeney
Mr Hadland
Mr Taylor

It can be seen that, based on the public HESA data, the critical issue is the proper treatment of HMOs.  All three experts agree that there is substantial a city-wide need for PBSA whichever year of assessment is chosen, which would be fully or partially met if HMOs and other private rented accommodation are taken to be an acceptable substitute.  The picture in the city centre is similar, with all three experts finding a significant need for additional PBSA provision if HMOs and the like are not taken into account as meeting part of the need.
Mr Feeney’s assessment of PBSA need using the licensed HESA data
Mr Feeney did not consider the public HESA data reliable.  His firm subscribes to a licenced version of the data, which he said facilitated a more detailed analysis of student populations.  In his view, the weakness of the public HESA data is its reliance on students correctly selecting the type of accommodation in which they are living from the descriptors provided. This results in significant inaccuracies, meaning the level of demand is under assessed.  For example, 27,785 students said that they were living at home or in their own residence, and would presumably therefore be commuting into university, but only 25,960 students were ordinarily domiciled in the West Midlands region. The licenced data revealed that the 27,785 who claimed to be living at home included students whose homes were in the north of Scotland, the north-east of England, Devon, Cornwall and other distant areas.  Additionally, an improbable 18% of international students stated that they were living at home or in their own residence in 2016/17. Mr Feeney considered that a significant proportion of the surprising entries were the results of misunderstandings by the students concerning the information being requested of them.  He also considered that, to the extent that these entries were accurate, students living so far from their place of study and facing long commutes should realistically form part of the demand pool for PBSA.
In forming his own assessment of PBSA need, Mr Feeney began with the total student population of 65,795, from which he excluded those who would be unlikely to require PBSA accommodation, because they were living in their own residence, with parents, or in non-PBSA accommodation in an area from which they could readily commute (the West Midlands, Worcestershire, or Warwickshire). He also excluded 990 students who were not studying in Birmingham, for example because they were studying temporarily abroad, or on placement, or were distance learners or at franchised partner institutions.
In Mr Feeney’s view, those students living within the West Midlands, Worcestershire or Warwickshire who were not in PBSA were making a conscious choice, despite some lengthy commute times.  He nevertheless considered that 1,280 students in the West Midlands who were not living with parents or in their own home could potentially be drawn into PBSA over time.  Similarly, there was potential for the cohort who were temporarily absent to be drawn into PBSA over time. Mr Feeney therefore considered that his total demand pool of 43,515 students could be considered conservative.
Mr Hadland considered that Mr Feeney’s use of the licensed HESA data led him to overstate the demand. Some students might live further afield than the immediately adjoining counties yet choose to commute.  For instance, Leicester is 60 minutes by train, and Derby 45 minutes representing potential commuting options, particularly for those students with limited contact time.  Many international students, Mr Hadland said, chose to live with family or friends and make longer commutes to avoid the costs of accommodation.
Using the licenced data, Mr Feeney calculated PBSA need of 22,666 bedspaces by comparing his demand pool of 43,515 with the agreed supply of 20,849 in 2016/17, or 21,433 using the 2017/18 supply of 20,082.   For the city centre, Mr Feeney calculated a PBSA need of 9,649 and 9,125 respectively.  In arriving at these initial figures Mr Feeney did not take account of growth or pipeline supply.
Mr Feeney then considered the pipeline of PBSA schemes for which planning consent had already been granted.  In his experience, only 65-70% of approved schemes are delivered, and (although this would not have been known at the valuation dates) of the 16 schemes with permission in 2018 only 12, or 89% of the bedspaces, were eventually built out.  Nevertheless, comparing his demand pool with the available number of bedspaces including those in the pipeline, he arrived at a city-wide PBSA need of 16,228 in March 2018, and 16,167 at the other 2018 valuation dates.   For the city centre, his figures were 5,512 and 5,451 respectively.  These figures, as he pointed out, accounted for growth in supply (excluding HMO’s), but not for growth in demand.
Mr Feeney maintained that a reasonable planning authority considering a PBSA needs assessment would not account for growth in the way the other experts had.   Nevertheless, in response to the other experts’ evidence, he projected growth to 2022/23, by which time the market would have expected the 2018 PBSA pipeline to be built out and ready for occupation (a year later than Mr Hadland’s assessment).  He also projected growth to 2030/31, as had Mr Taylor.
Making these adjustments as at March 2018 led Mr Feeney to assess a City wide planning need in 2022/23 of 25,239 bedspaces, and a need of 25,178 as at the later valuation dates; his equivalent figures with growth projected to 2030/31 were 37,935 and 37, 874.
For the city centre, on the same basis, Mr Feeney’s figures were 9,607 and 9,546 to 2022/23, and 15,468 and 15,407 to 2030/31.
In Mr Taylor’s second report, he used the licensed data to produce ‘heat maps’ to show where in the city students studying at the various different institutions were concentrated.  These demonstrated a not insignificant overlap between the city centre and the UoB area for students living in private-sector, provider maintained, and HMO accommodation.  This added to his argument that the market was fluid between geographical areas and that the appropriate way of assessing need was therefore on a city-wide basis.
Discussion
Area of assessment
One point of difference between Mr Hadland on the one hand and Mr Taylor and Mr Feeney on the other was whether it was appropriate to assess “planning need” for PBSA by reference only to the city centre, or the city as a whole.  In determining where our focus should be, we bear in mind the PPG advice to assess needs by reference to the ‘relevant functional area’ (or housing market area) and its observation that establishing the assessment area may identify smaller sub-markets with specific features.
The City Council’s SHLAA identified its total housing need at 89,000 homes – of which it would only be able to provide 51,000 within its boundary over the plan period to 2031.  That part of the development plan was city-wide, indeed beyond the city’s boundaries.
Although the development plan defines the centre as one specific area of the city, policy TP33 does not differentiate between areas, it applies across the city. The supporting text explains how PBSA can contribute towards the city’s housing requirements as a whole.
During 2018, the City Council appears to have been content to look only at the broadest picture when considering planning applications for PBSA.  At both Upper Dean Street and the Nautical Club it received needs assessments which referred only to the City’s full time student population.   We do not read the officer’s report at Vesey Street as endorsing a sub-market assessment; as Mr Elvin submitted in closing, the report simply identifies that there would be sufficient need from the adjoining Aston and BCU.
Although it had previously been satisfied with relatively unfocused evidence of need, the City Council’s planning committee was advised by its officers in November 2019 that consideration should be given to the local area around the university to be served, and that evidence of city wide need alone ought not to be accepted as sufficient.  That advice may or may not have been intended as a corrective to previous practice, but in either case we do not read it as suggesting that city wide need was thought to be irrelevant, merely that it would not be sufficient to focus only on the bigger picture.  That seems to us to be no more than policy TP33, properly applied, will inevitably require since the first bullet point is concerned with the need for the proposed development, without limit on where that need may come from, while the second focusses on the capacity of the site, in terms of its location, to meet that need.  A focus on the city centre, to the exclusion of the wider picture, or vice versa, would therefore be unlikely to address the requirements of the policy as a whole.
It was common ground that the route of the B4215, A456 and A4540 main roads which cut across the city below the centre, forms a relevant boundary zone.  To Mr Hadland it appeared that University of Birmingham students were generally accommodated to the south of that line, while students from the three city centre universities were generally housed to the north, although with some overlapping from either side.
Mr Hadland’s experience was that students generally tend to seek PBSA within a maximum 20-minute walk from their place of learning.   He produced a plan showing the separation zone, and circles equivalent to the radius of a 20-minute walk, although he said that he had not rigidly applied these to define the boundary of his sub-market.  But Mr Taylor’s heat maps demonstrated that around 18% of University of Birmingham (‘UoB’) students) lived beyond a 20-minute walking distance and the agreed supply data included over 1,000 bedspaces at Hamstead Hall and Oscott Gardens which are 80 and 69 minutes’ walk from the BCU campus. Mr Feeney also showed that both UoB and BCU entered into nomination agreements for PBSA beds at further distances – generally around 35-45 minutes’ walk away, but in one case much further. It was therefore understandable that in cross-examination Mr Hadland sought to row back from his original reliance on walking distances as a way of demarcating relevant sub-areas.
We accept Mr Taylor’s evidence that the role of sub-areas within a planning needs assessment is not to carve up the planning need and isolate it to within pre-defined areas so that only developments within those pre-defined areas can be regarded as satisfying it.   In applying the PPG, the City Council is required to have regard to the whole of its administrative area, both in policy making and decision-taking. We have no doubt that the whole city forms the functional assessment area for the assessment of general housing need.   The assessment of need for PBSA is one aspect of that wider housing need and for the reasons advanced by Mr Taylor it too should be assessed across the city as a whole.  As he demonstrated, there is fluidity within the student housing market, with ‘bleed’ across various notional sub-market boundaries.  There also exists what he called a dynamic network in which new provision in one location can free up bed spaces within another to meet different needs.
In addition, Mr Hadland’s approach, when considering the issues in the round, produces inconsistencies, in that he considered the demand side from a limited geographic area, but supply from a wider area.  That is likely to result in an underestimate of demand.
While these considerations seem to us to militate against too localised an approach to the assessment of need, they cannot diminish the fact that we are dealing with notional applications for specific sites.  We have no difficulty in accepting the general proposition that, given a choice, most students are likely to prefer to be accommodated somewhere which is convenient to their place of study.  It is clear from the Council’s own November 2019 report that it was advised to have regard both to the citywide picture and to the locality of a particular site.  If it could be demonstrated that a need existed in one location which could be satisfied by a site in close proximity to that location, then it might not be necessary to consider any wider need unless there was a suggestion of an oversupply somewhere else.  If the need was not concentrated in one area, but was spread across the city, then a judgment might be required about how and where it should best be met.  The necessary assessment is less blinkered and more nuanced than some of the evidence acknowledged.  In short, we consider that it is likely to be appropriate to have regard both to the need for PBSA in the city as whole and to any specific need in a particular location, and we can see nothing in policy TP33 which rules that out.
Time horizon and rate of growth
It is common ground that a reasonable planning authority applying TP33 would reach a judgment on planning need for PBSA taking into account an estimate of future growth of student demand for PBSA.  The only disagreements are over what period and at what rate growth should be accounted for.
Mr Hadland and Mr Taylor came to a similar view that there had been historic growth in student numbers of around 18%, or 3.1% per annum CAGR (compound annual growth rate) between 2016/17 and 2021/22.  They both then assumed that growth would continue at the same rate, extrapolating forward, Mr Taylor commenting that this was a conservative estimate which should be considered a minimum.
Mr Taylor projected growth using the previous five and ten year aggregate compound growth rates, although for the whole of the city there was little between the two – 3.10% and 3.08% respectively – with both projecting student numbers at around 101,500 by 2030/31.
Mr Feeney considered these growth estimates to be unrealistically low.   By analysing student numbers in the city centre (to compare with those of Mr Hadland), he calculated that the three city centre universities grew total student numbers by 20%, numbers of students from outside the region (and therefore more likely to require PBSA) grew by 25%.  His analysed growth figure, based on the licenced data, was 25.7% between 2014/15 and 2021/22.
A number of factors feed into an assessment of growth.  There was a general consensus that while at the valuation dates the UK was part way through a ‘demographic dip’ in the population of 18-year-olds, slightly more pronounced in the West Midlands than nationally, and that this was set to continue until the early 2020’s, in fact the number of full-time undergraduates was increasing, both nationally and at the Birmingham universities which have seen a consistent increase in students of just over 3% when the number of 18-year-olds was in decline.
Universities at the higher end of the league tables, for instance UoB and Aston, are thought to be better placed to respond to the population decline.  By 2030 the number of 18-year-olds is likely to exceed 750,000, some 15% higher than the number at the valuation dates.  We were also referred to the investment that the Birmingham universities were making to their campuses, for instance BCU’s new campus facilities and investment in facilities by UoB, Aston and UCB.
Having regard to this evidence we think it more likely than not that in 2018 it would have been assumed that the future growth of student numbers in Birmingham would be at a higher rate than that seen historically, and in any event we prefer Mr Feeney’s evidence on growth, based on his licenced data.  Predicting growth using the historic growth rates as Mr Hadland and Mr Taylor did would underestimate student numbers in the future, and all things being equal, therefore underestimate the need for PBSA (as Mr Taylor warned might be the case).
As regards the period over which growth should be assessed, Mr Hadland allowed for anticipated growth in the demand pool over a period of four years from the valuation dates (five years from the date of the data) because it allowed for a three-year long stop for planning permissions, allowed a reasonable time for PBSA under construction or with consent to become operational at which point such estimates of planning need would become material, and finally because universities consider that any projections beyond a five-year horizon are made with significantly lower confidence. Little if any reliance, he said, was placed on projections over a longer period.  In his experience, universities find their own student growth numbers difficult to predict.  He noted that as part of the November 2019 planning report, BCC had engaged in consultation with the universities, but he accepted that there was no evidence that the council had access to any forecasts when making its decisions at around the valuation dates.
Mr Taylor considered it appropriate to project growth in student numbers to the end of the local plan period (2031), on the basis that a reasonable planning authority would not confine themselves to what is in effect a four year period. The NPPF requires strategic policies, including TP33, to ‘provide a clear strategy for bringing sufficient land forward, at a sufficient rate, to address objectively assessed needs over the plan period’.  Paragraph 60 requires authorities to conduct housing needs assessments for different groups including students (61), and then to assess how those needs can be met over the plan period (65).   Paragraph 22 of the NPPF directs that strategic policies should ‘look ahead over a minimum 15 year period from adoption’.
In cross-examination, Mr Hadland accepted that, on the material before us, using the plan period would be a reasonable basis to proceed, and it would be in accordance with government policy.  He also accepted that the CAAD schemes (as currently certified), are of a size which would be phased over a number of years and this would suggest the period of growth considered should project beyond a four-year period.
However, the period over which growth is assessed on the demand side of the calculation, must have some regard to the availability of evidence of growth in supply.  We take two things from the evidence. First, even without the benefit of hindsight which Mr Feeney referred to, at the valuation dates it cannot sensibly have been thought that all of the pipeline would necessarily be delivered.  That would weigh in favour of need for PBSA being under-assessed. But secondly, assessing growth to the end of the plan period based solely on the agreed pipeline – schemes under construction or with planning permission – is likely to under-assess supply, as it assumes no other schemes will come forward during the period, which we consider very unlikely.  We will therefore place greater weight on growth in the shorter term, which would have been assumed with more confidence at the valuation date.
“HMOs”
As we have seen, the experts use ‘HMOs’ as a shorthand for all forms of private rented accommodation other than PBSA. In summary, Mr Hadland included all HMOs in his supply calculation, Mr Feeney excluded all, and Mr Taylor took 50% as a conservative estimate of the contribution HMOs make to supply.
Mr Hadland and Mr Taylor both took ‘other rented accommodation’ as calculated in the HESA data as a proxy for HMOs.  Mr Hadland, fairly, noted that the data was likely to also include some accommodation that would not fall within the HMO regime, for instance one or two-bedroomed flats, but as he was interested in other housing options available to students, this did not affect his analysis.
In his first report, based on the public HESA data, Mr Hadland calculated that 5,395 students in the city centre were living in ‘other rented accommodation’.  This was later revised to 3,265.
Mr Feeney’s evidence was that only 1,470 of the students reporting in the public HESA data that they were in other rented accommodation were living in the city centre – which he considered comprised postcodes B1 – B6.   In a subsequent note, Mr Hadland accepted that his figure required adjustment, but thought Mr Feeney’s figure too low. Widening the postcode range, Mr Hadland came to a revised ‘HMO’ figure of 3,812 students.
Mr Taylor noted that the data showed 16,430 students in ‘other rented accommodation’ across the city, which represented 25% of the total student population; and this was the figure quoted in the SHLAA. In the case of UoB, the figure was much higher at 40%.
As we have described in paragraphs 34, 41 and 45 above, the desirability of moving students out of the general private sector into PBSA to increase the overall housing stock is reflected in national policy in the PPG, and in the City Council’s SHLAA, and its Article 4 direction.  We are therefore confident that in assessing the need for PBSA, one relevant consideration to which a decision maker should have regard is the beneficial impact which additional high quality student accommodation is likely to have in freeing up other accommodation to meet more general housing needs.
In cross-examination, Mr Hadland accepted a series of propositions put to him by Mr Pereira which in combination forced him to accept that the consequence of applying national policy guidance was that existing HMOs should not be counted as part of existing supply when assessing planning need for PBSA.
We are nevertheless sceptical as to whether all students living in ‘other rented’ accommodation should be included in the assessment of demand for PBSA.  Whatever changes in student behaviour planning policy may wish to encourage, PBSA will not suit all students, or their resources, and it is unrealistic to assume a demand for PBSA from all of those who are not living at home.
Drawing the threads together
Notwithstanding the parties’ suggestion that “planning need” should be expressed as a specific figure we are not satisfied that it is either necessary or possible to do so on the evidence we have heard, and we will express our own conclusions in broader numbers.  Policy TP33 requires that a need for PBSA be demonstrated by reference to a particular development involving a particular number of bedspaces.  To provide that demonstration it is not necessary to quantify the total need for PBSA, whether in the city as a whole or in the city centre.  If a need can be demonstrated for at least as much accommodation as the particular proposal is intended to provide, and if the application site is well located to satisfy that need, the extent of any greater need is unlikely to be of much significance.  The evidence we have heard has not been focussed on a particular development and addresses the larger question, not the narrower one; nor is the evidence sufficiently robust, or the question sufficiently well formulated, in our judgment, to support definitive figures in the way the experts have sought to do.  But it is not necessary for us to be as precise as they have been in order to assess whether there was sufficient need for PBSA to persuade a reasonable planning authority to grant consent for each of the Eastside sites viewed in isolation.
Our starting point is that, as was common ground, the publicly available HESA data is unreliable.   We agree with Mr Feeney that it is likely to underestimate demand, for all the reasons rehearsed above, but the most telling of which, in our view, is first that the data would suggest an occupancy rate of only about 73% (16,100 students in 22,082 bed spaces) whereas PBSA occupancy is generally over 90%. Secondly, the public data implied that 18% of international students were living at home, which cannot be correct.  In our judgment, inevitably that means that by relying only on the public data Mr Hadland has underestimated demand.
We are satisfied that it would have been assumed in 2018 that future growth would be at a higher rate than that seen in previous years, for the reasons we outlined above.  We prefer Mr Feeney’s evidence on growth and think that the growth rate which was largely agreed between Mr Hadland and Mr Taylor is too low – as Mr Taylor thought likely.   That would again point to demand being higher than Mr Hadland allowed for.
The period to which growth should be applied is connected, in our view, to how supply is also likely to change – from the pipeline.   Whilst it might be permissible in terms of planning policy to project growth through to the end of the plan period in 2031 (as Mr Hadland was persuaded to accept in cross examination) it is not obligatory to do so when considering an application for a specific site.  We consider it is illogical to take account of growth over a period which is too long to enable a reliable assessment of likely supply over the same period.
We are concerned with the need for PBSA at the valuation dates, not at some date in the relatively distant future.  BCC was prepared to grant planning permission on a number of occasions without growth being quantified in the supporting needs assessments. An expectation of future growth, and future supply, is part of what a reasonable planning authority would take into account in the round, but we are not persuaded that it is necessary or helpful to quantify it over four or ten years into the future.
Putting ourselves in the position of a decision maker considering the need for PBSA on the valuation dates, we are confident that growth in student numbers – whether over four years or longer – at the Birmingham universities would be significant, and higher than in previous years.  The substantial shortfall which was demonstrated on current figures would be expected to increase unless sufficient additional PBSA was made available. Those considerations would contribute to demonstrating a need for PBSA.
Mr Feeney assessed PBSA need on five different bases.  His first, second and fifth methods were based on the licensed public HESA data, which we consider more reliable than those methods (Mr Hadland’s, Mr Taylor’s and Mr Feeney’s third and fourth versions) which were based on the publicly available data set.
Of his first two methods, it seems to us that comparing 2016/17 demand with supply in the same year is more logical than his second version, which compares demand for that year with supply for 2017/18 without accounting for growth.  And for similar reasons we place less weight on Mr Feeney’s fifth method, which accounted for the pipeline supply without accounting for growth in demand.
So, we take Mr Feeney’s shortfall figures of 22,666 for the city as a whole, and 9,649 for the city centre, as our starting points.  But we think there is something to Mr Hadland’s observation that some students would be willing to commute from out of the area.  Derby, for instance, is a short train ride away, and commutable for an enthusiastic student.  That may reduce the need figure, but doing the best we can on the evidence, we consider it would still be at a level in the late teens or around 20,000 for the city, or around 9,000 for the city centre.
Part of that need would continue to be met by HMOs or other forms of privately rented accommodation.  But given the size of the shortfall and the contribution made by PBSA to freeing other privately rented accommodation for the wider housing market, we do not consider the availability of HMOs undermines the obvious and substantial need for additional PBSA at the valuation date.  A planning need has been demonstrated for far more PBSA than any one of the sites would be capable of accommodating.
That need is made out whichever expert’s evidence is preferred.  For example, in the city centre, even if Mr Hadland was correct to include all ‘other rented’ accommodation in his assessment of supply, his revised figure for HMOs of 3,265 bedspaces would result in a shortfall in excess of 5,500 bedspaces.   For the city as a whole, even if it is assumed that there is no demand for PBSA from any of the 16,430 students who reported that they were in ‘other rented’ accommodation, a shortfall of more than 3,500 would arise.
Assuming that some of the students accommodated in HMOs would prefer to live in PBSA, thus reducing the ‘other rented’ accommodation, as Mr Taylor did, or removing it entirely as Mr Feeney advocated, would significantly increase the shortfall.
Even if it is assumed that no HMO student should be included in the demand pool for PBSA, which we do not consider a sensible assumption, applying what can be considered a reasonable level of growth of 20% over five years from the valuation dates would result in an additional need in the order of 4,500 bedspaces.  In the light of that as a reasonable prediction, the agreed pipeline of 5,394 bedspaces would not be enough to result in a surplus, on either a city centre or city-wide basis, and we are doubtful that all of the pipeline would be built out.   As we have said, estimating growth beyond ten years faces the difficulty that and extended pipeline is unknown.
On any view, therefore, we are persuaded that a need has been demonstrated at each of the valuation dates for substantial further PBSA, such that the first bullet point of policy TP33 would not have been problematic for any of the Eastside sites.
That assessment is consistent with the view the City Council took as planning authority: its SHLAA, for instance, assumed a shortfall of 15,000 bedspaces in July 2018, and each of the planning permissions and CAADs it granted was predicated on a substantial need for PBSA.  For the reasons we have given we are satisfied that those decisions were consistent with the City Council’s own policy and that the need they identified was real.

Hearing dates: 14, 15 and 26 November 2024
Approved Judgment
This judgment was handed down remotely at 10.00 am on 14 January, 2025 by circulation to the parties or their representatives by e-mail and by release to the National Archives.
Mrs Justice Joanna Smith:
This is my reserved judgment in respect of an application made by the Defendant at a CMC held on 14, 15 and 26 November 2024.  The application, issued on 13 June 2024 (“the Application”), is for an Order that pursuant to CPR r.19.8(2) the Sixth Claimant may not act as representative for the class of individuals identified in paragraph 17 of the Amended Particulars of Claim dated 19 January 2024 (“the APoC”).
Background to the Application
To put this Application in context, I need to set out something about the proceedings themselves and the issues to which they give rise. The next few paragraphs are slightly adapted from my judgment in an unsuccessful summary judgment/strike out application made by the Defendant in 2023 (Getty Images (US) Inc v Stability AI Limited [2023] EWHC 3090 (Ch)).
The proceedings are for copyright infringement, database right infringement, trade mark infringement and passing off against the Defendant, an open-source generative artificial intelligence (“AI”) company incorporated in England and Wales in November 2019 with registered offices in London.  The claim concerns the Defendant’s deep learning AI model (known as “Stable Diffusion”), which the Defendant makes available to users in the United Kingdom by a variety of means. Stable Diffusion generates synthetic image outputs in response to commands entered by users.
The First to Fifth Claimants are members of a group of companies (“the Getty Images Group”) ultimately owned and controlled by Getty Images Holdings, Inc.  The Getty Images Group is described in the Amended Particulars of Claim as a “pre-eminent global visual content creator and market place”.
The Getty Images Group licenses its content (in the form of millions of visual assets including photographs, video footage and illustrations, together with associated captions, covering a broad range of subject matter) (“the Content”) through websites to creative, corporate and media customers in more than 200 countries (“the Getty Images Websites”).
A substantial proportion of the Content is said to comprise original artistic works and/or film works in which copyright subsists (“the Copyright Works”).  The APoC asserts the existence of millions of Copyright Works in respect of which it is alleged that the First Claimant is either the copyright owner or the exclusive licensee.
In broad terms, the Claimants’ complaint is that the Defendant has scraped millions of images from the Getty Images Websites, without the Claimants’ consent, and used those images unlawfully as input to train and develop Stable Diffusion.  Further, the Claimants say that the output of Stable Diffusion is itself infringing, not least because it is said to reproduce a substantial part of the Claimants’ Copyright Works and/or bears the Claimants’ trade marks.
The Defendant admits that “at least some images from the Getty Images Website were used during the training of Stable Diffusion” but it has not identified those images.
The Claimants raise various causes of action, but for present purposes I need concentrate only on their claims of copyright infringement (“the Copyright Infringement Claims”), which are advanced on three bases:
first, a claim of copyright infringement arising from the Claimants’ allegation that during the development and training of Stable Diffusion, the Content including the Claimants’ Copyright Works, was downloaded on servers and/or computers in the United Kingdom (“the Training and Development Claim”);
second, a claim of secondary infringement of copyright said by the Claimants to arise by reason of the importation of an “article”, namely the pre-trained Stable Diffusion software, into the UK (“the Secondary Infringement Claim”); and
third, a claim that the output of Stable Diffusion in the form of synthetic images (accessed by users in the United Kingdom) is also itself infringing in that it reproduces a substantial part of the Copyright Works (“the Output Claim” (Footnote: 1)).
The Output Claim is advanced in respect of (i) the generation of images from text prompts (“thetext prompts claim”); (ii) the generation of images from image prompts (“theimage prompts claim”); and (iii) the generation of images from combined image and text prompts (“the image plus text prompts claim”), the latter being a very recent addition to the Claimants’ pleaded case.
In view of the vast number of Copyright Works alleged to be involved in the Copyright Infringement Claims, the Claimants rely upon a selection (“the Sample Works”) for the purpose of establishing subsistence and ownership.  These comprise Works A to K.  Works A to D are works that are owned by the First Claimant.  Works E to K are works that are owned by the Sixth Claimant and exclusively licensed to the First Claimant.  In its Amended Defence, the Defendant confirms that it is “content that the question whether its activities have involved infringement of the Copyright Works be resolved by reference to the Sample Works” (whilst also noting that it does not accept any entitlement to general or wider relief in the event the court were to make a finding of infringement).  Further, “[i]n the interests of procedural economy”, the Defendant admits the allegations of authorship and subsistence of UK copyright in relation to the Sample Works.
In respect of the Copyright Infringement Claims the Claimants seek by way of relief, inter alia: (i) a declaration that copyright subsists in the Copyright Works and has been infringed by the Defendant; (ii) an injunction to restrain the Defendant (without a written licence or agreement from the Claimants) from acting in various ways which would infringe copyright in the Copyright Works; and (iii) an inquiry as to damages for copyright infringement or, at the election of the Claimants, an account of profits.
It is the Claimants’ case that there are likely to be in excess of 50,000 photographers and Content contributors who are owners of the copyright subsisting in Content that has been licensed on an exclusive basis to the First Claimant over several decades.  By reason of these exclusive licences, each of these copyright owners is alleged to have a concurrent right of action with the First Claimant under sections 101 and 102 of the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 (“the CDPA”) to restrain the Defendant’s unlawful acts of copyright infringement and to seek relief in respect of such acts.
Against that background, the action is also brought by the Sixth Claimant, Thomas M. Barwick, Inc, (a company incorporated under the laws of Washington and engaged in the process of creating and licensing visual content) in a representative capacity, as explained in paragraph 17 of the APoC (Footnote: 2).  A prominent photographer, Mr Thomas Barwick, is the Sixth Claimant’s director.  Mr Barwick has had a long professional relationship with the Getty Images Group and many thousands of his images and videos are available on the Getty Images Websites.  It is the Claimants’ case that Mr Barwick has assigned all legal and equitable title in the works created by him to the Sixth Claimant which has in turn exclusively licensed Content to the First Claimant.  Attached to the APoC at Annex 2 are details of various agreements entered into between the Sixth Claimant and the First Claimant.  In its Amended Defence, the Defendant admits the pleaded licensing arrangements relating to the Sixth Claimant (save that it denies that the pleaded chain of title is effective in passing title to any Copyright Works from the Second to the First Claimants).  It makes “no wider admissions as to other Copyright Works, and whether the Sample Works are representative of other Copyright Works which may be within the First Claimant’s portfolio of images and films”.
The Claimants plead in paragraph 18 of the APoC that the Sixth Claimant “represents and has the same interest in this claim as the parties who are owners of artistic works and film works that have been licensed on an exclusive basis to the First Claimant” (“the Represented Parties”).
The Claimants further particularised their representative claim in a Response to a Request For information dated 30 May 2023 (“the Further Information”) in the following terms:
“…the class of persons represented by the Sixth Claimant are those who are owners of the copyright subsisting in artistic works and film works that have been licensed on an exclusive basis to the First Claimant, the copyright in which has been infringed by the Defendant.  The persons that fall within such class can be identified on the basis that (i) they have entered into an exclusive licence with the First Claimant in respect of artistic works and/or film works; and (ii) the exclusively licensed works include works which were used to train Stable Diffusion, as alleged in paragraph 34 of the Particulars of Claim”.
The Claimants assert that it would be disproportionate to identify all members of the class owing to their enormous number and/or the fact that “the precise works used to train Stable Diffusion are within the knowledge of the Defendant”.  They go on to state in the Further Information that the interest shared by the Sixth Claimant and the Represented Parties is that of “ensuring that their copyright is not infringed by the Defendant”.  The Represented Parties are said to be entitled to:
“…all those remedies relating to copyright claimed in the prayer for relief of the Particulars of Claim, including an inquiry as to damages, on the basis of the Defendant’s acts of copyright infringement in respect of works in which the Represented Parties own the copyright and have licensed the same on an exclusive basis to the First Claimant”.
Finally, the Further Information states that the question of whether any individual assessment of damages will be necessary is “a matter that will fall for determination following the trial on liability and/or at the damages inquiry or account”.
In its Amended Defence, the Defendant pleads that the Claimants’ original pleading involved an unclear and imprecise definition of the represented class.  In broad terms, the Defendant denies that the Sixth Claimant shares “the same interest” as the other alleged owners of copyright in Content exclusively licensed to the First Claimant and asserts that identifying whether their Content has been used to train Stable Diffusion, whether their copyright has been infringed and whether they are entitled to damages “requires an individualised assessment”.  The Defendant denies that the action can proceed on a representative basis.
In an Amended Reply, the Claimants deny that they have failed to set out proper particulars of the basis for the representative claim, given the content of the Further Information.  They admit that the Represented Parties “do not all have licensing terms which are identical to each other in every respect”, but they assert that “many of the Represented Parties have entered into standard licence terms (known as ‘the Contributor Agreement’)” and that although the Contributor Agreement has varied over time “in all versions of the Contributor Agreement the relevant content is licensed to the First Claimant exclusively on a worldwide basis to be marketed and sublicensed for any purpose”.  Further, the Claimants assert that “each of the Represented Parties have the same licensing terms in the respect which is material for the purpose of CPR 19.8, that is that the relevant content is licensed to the First Claimant exclusively in (at least) the UK”.  If there is any diversity of interest between the Represented Parties (which the Claimants deny) they assert that it may be resolved, if necessary “as part of any inquiry as to damages or account of profits”.
In addition to the fact that standard licence terms upon which the Claimants rely provide for exclusivity, in their evidence on the Application, the Claimants also point out that those standard licence terms also give to the First Claimant the right to bring proceedings for infringement of the licensed Content (“the Right To Control Claims Clause”).
Procedural Developments
As they were entitled to do, the Claimants made the representative claim from the outset of the proceedings.  The Defendant put that claim in issue as I have already identified but, thereafter, case management proceeded without any further real focus on the claim of the Sixth Claimant or the potential ramifications for the trial of a representative claim.  As will become apparent, I consider this to have been a mistake.  Where a representative claim is to be pursued it appears to me to be critical that its scope and likely impact on the trial, together with any directions which may be required in order to flush out the issues on that claim, is considered in detail from an early stage of the proceedings.
In July 2023, the Defendant applied for summary judgment and/or strike out in respect of various elements of the claim, an application which I heard on 1 November 2023.  At that application, the Defendant reserved its position as to the representative claim but did not seek to raise it as a live issue.  The Claimants also did not seek to raise it for consideration.  The summary judgment application was subsequently dismissed.  Since then, the court has heard various applications and made a number of orders as to the management of the case.
On 22 April 2024, Master McQuail ordered a first trial to determine liability which has since been listed with a time estimate of 18 days (including four non-sitting days) to commence in a 5 day window starting on 9 June 2025 (“the First Trial”).
The Defendant eventually made the Application on 13 June 2024.  It was supported by five short paragraphs in the application notice explaining that the Defendant would rely upon its pleading, but that any hearing of the Application should take place only following the provision by the Claimants of a fully particularised case on the Copyright Infringement Claims, at which point the court would then be able to determine “whether the sixth claimant is capable of acting as a representative party”.  Accordingly the Defendant sought further directions from the court.
The matter came back before me on 9 July 2024 for a CCMC.  In an Order of the same date (“the CCMC Order”), I gave directions for the service of evidence in the Application from the Claimants, including copies of “all versions” of the Contributor Agreement referred to in the Amended Reply and copies of any other licensing terms which were common to more than 500 of the Represented Parties.
The CCMC Order also addressed various outstanding issues of case management, including granting permission for amendments to be made to the APoC (a Re-Amended Particulars of Claim (“the RAPoC”) was subsequently served on 12 July 2024). The CCMC Order recognised (in the recitals) the need for the parties to correspond with a view to “resolving the position regarding whether the liability trial in these proceedings on the issue of subsistence and ownership of copyright in the Copyright Works” would proceed on the basis of “the Sample Works (Footnote: 3)” and any Copyright Works relied upon by the Claimants in a Statement of Case on Infringement (“the SOCI”).  The CCMC Order provided for the SOCI to be served on 30 August 2024 (albeit that the SOCI was in fact served on 6 September 2024 and updated on 13 September 2024). The SOCI was required in order to support “the breadth of [the Claimants’] case on the Output Claims”.
A further hearing took place before me on 20 September 2024 designed to deal with a specific issue that had arisen as to the disclosure of information relevant to Amazon Web Service data transfers into the UK, together with an application by the Defendant for disclosure of images and prompts used or generated by the Claimants in the preparation of the SOCI.  As reflected in the Order of the same date, the application for disclosure of these images and prompts was adjourned, with the Claimants voluntarily agreeing to provide the majority of the disclosure of images and prompts sought.  Disclosure was then provided on 25 September 2024.
On 26 September 2024, the Claimants served the eighth witness statement of Nicholas Rose (“Rose 8”) containing their reply evidence in the Application.  Specifically Mr Rose sets out some background to the Claimants’ licensing business and this claim, some background to the Sixth Claimant and a brief description of the Contributor Agreements and other agreements that were being disclosed by the Claimants in accordance with the CCMC Order.  This evidence provides additional detail about licensing agreements to which the Sixth Claimant is party over and above the agreements already pleaded by the Claimants.
On 21 October 2024 the Defendant served the sixth witness statement of Toby Bond (“Bond 6”) in response to the evidence in Rose 8.  Mr Bond addresses the procedural background to the Application, the issue of class definition, the interests represented by the members of the represented class and the case management implications of the Claimants’ proposed representative claim.
On 4 November 2024, the Claimants served further evidence in the form of the ninth witness statement of Mr Rose (“Rose 9”).  In this statement, Mr Rose referred to a number of additional licence agreements which had been identified after service of Rose 8 and had not previously been listed in Annex 2 to the RAPoC.  These included Barwick Agreement #9, also referred to by the parties as Contributor Agreement #17 (“CA#17”), dated 3 October 2023.  The Claimants maintain that CA#17 is the most relevant of the licence agreements owing to the fact that it has superseded all previous agreements.  I was taken to its terms during the course of the hearing.
On the same day, the parties gave Extended Disclosure in the proceedings in accordance with the CCMC Order, having agreed by consent to extend the deadline.
Over the last couple of months, the Claimants’ case, as set out in the SOCI, has been amended with a view to clarifying exactly how the Claimants intend to advance their case on the Output Claims at the First Trial.  The up to date position (only really clarified at, or shortly before, the hearing) is that the Claimants now identify (i) 17 Copyright Works on which they rely (alone) for the purposes of the text prompts claim (Footnote: 4); (ii) 5 Copyright Works (a subset of the original 17) on which they rely (alone) for the image plus text prompts claim; and (iii) 5 Copyright Works (again a subset of the original 17) on which they rely  as “examples” for the image prompts claim. These “examples” are said to be “representative of the infringing Output that will be obtained” if using the relevant image prompt.  The First Claimant is alleged to own outright 11 of these identified Copyright Works, while the remaining 6 Copyright Works are said to have been authored by a number of different individuals who subsequently entered into an exclusive licence agreement with the First Claimant.  None of these individual licensors is the Sixth Claimant.
Prior to the clarification of the Claimants’ case referred to above, the Defendant served a responsive SOCI on 8 November 2024 which complained as to inconsistencies between the Claimants’ case as set out in correspondence and in its SOCI.  The Defendant’s responsive SOCI has inevitably now been somewhat overtaken by events.
On 3 December 2024, after the hearing in the Application, the Claimants served a Re-Re-Amended Particulars of Claim (“the RRAPoC”) together with an Amended SOCI reflecting their clarified case. Permission for the RRAPoC was granted by Order dated 6 December 2024.  Amongst other things, the RRAPoC now asserts that the Sixth Claimant entered into licence agreements with the First and/or the Fifth Claimant and it identifies the forms of agreement that were in force at the date of the acts complained of.  Amendments are made to Annex 2 to identify the additional agreements on which the Claimants now seek to rely.  Re-Re-Amended Annex 8G to the RRAPoC relies on a few additional synthetic images generated in response to image prompts, a couple of which appear to have been authored by the Sixth Claimant. The Defendant has permission under the Order of 6 December 2024 to serve a Re-Amended Defence and Re-Amended Reply SOCI by 23 December 2024.
The Order of 6 December 2024 expressly provides that following service of the Defendant’s amended pleadings, the parties shall correspond “with a view to resolving the Samples Question in relation to the output claim alleging infringement by the use of image prompt”. The need for this only became apparent at the hearing of the Application in circumstances where the Claimants indicated an intention to amend their case (as is now done at 50B of the RRAPoC) to plead (a narrower) image prompts claim by reference to the use of an image strength of “a value between 0.0 and 0.25”, a pleading to which the Defendant wishes to respond before seeking to address the question of sampling.
Pausing there, although there has already been a need for a number of hearings in this matter to address the numerous procedural issues on which the parties have been unable to agree, nevertheless these have taken place in circumstances where directions have already been given for the progress of this case to the First Trial in approximately 6 months’ time.  Owing to the court dealing with specific disputes between the parties and often having insufficient time to address all of those disputes, there has to date been no consideration by the court as to the possible impact on the First Trial of (i) the continuing development of each side’s positions on sampling for the purposes of the Copyright Infringement Claim; and (ii) the representative claim.  The chronology to which I have referred shows that the Claimants did not particularise their Output Claim until service of the SOCI and that, even then, the way in which they have sought to advance that claim (specifically as to how it is to be proved at trial) has been something of a moveable feast.  No doubt these issues are, at least in part, a function of the very considerable substantive and procedural challenges that present themselves in litigation involving allegations of infringement on such a massive scale.
The Claimants contend that none of this matters, because the issues that have largely been agreed between the parties for determination at the First Trial are unaffected by any individual issues that might arise in respect of the Represented Parties. They point out that the List of Issues for trial prepared for the CCMC does not include any issues relating to authorship, subsistence or ownership of the Copyright Works and that no disclosure has been sought by the Defendant in relation to these issues.  The List of Issues also raises no issue in relation to the assertion that the Sixth Claimant entered into an exclusive licence with the First Claimant and the Amended Defence does not suggest that any individualised assessment is required in relation to either ownership or the existence of an exclusive licence – a clear indication, submit the Claimants, that there is really no dispute on these topics.
The Claimants further submit that it would be impossible to join all of the Represented Parties to these proceedings and that if the court were to accede to the Defendant’s Application that would be “tantamount to finding that infringement on a huge scale by using copyright works for an AI model cannot be litigated in the English courts because there is no mechanism to deal with the enormous number of works and parties involved”.  The Claimants contend that this is precisely the kind of situation in which a claim brought by a representative party pursuant to CPR 19.8 was intended to be used.  Further they say that their intention to rely upon samples for certain of their Copyright Infringement Claims has been clear for some time, that that intention is consistent with the pursuit of a representative claim and they reject any suggestion that there are case management reasons for acceding to the Application.
Alternatively, and as a fall-back position, the Claimants contend that they should be given permission pursuant to CPR 19.3(1) for these proceedings to be brought without joinder of the exclusive licensors.
The Defendant profoundly disagrees with the position adopted by the Claimants. It submits that the Claimants bear the burden of advancing their representative claim and that this ought to have involved the identification of proposals at an early stage for its determination. The Defendant contends that this has not happened, that there remain various outstanding issues as to how the Copyright Infringement Claims are to be tried (including, most significantly, as to sampling in respect of various of those claims) and that, accordingly, if the representative claim is permitted to continue, the court will be left with “an untriable mess”.  The Defendant strongly objects to the proposed fall-back position under CPR 19.3 which has never been pleaded and was raised for the first time only in one paragraph at the end of Rose 9.
The Hearing of the Application
I heard the Application over the course of two days on 14 and 15 November 2024 (“the Hearing”).  During the course of the argument it became clear that insufficient focus had been brought to bear on the efficient management of the Copyright Infringement Claims to the First Trial, including the extent to which sampling of Copyright Works under the various Copyright Infringement Claims (including the representative claim) would be appropriate.  The List of Issues produced for the CCMC does not identify any issues at all arising in connection with the Sixth Claimant and none has been proposed by the Claimants. Furthermore, as the submissions developed, the extent of the disagreement between the parties as to how the Copyright Infringement Claims were to be dealt with at the First Trial became starkly apparent.
This unsatisfactory state of affairs led to proposals for the management of the First Trial being advanced on the second day of the Hearing by the Defendant, some of which appeared capable of agreement, whilst others quite obviously needed further discussion.  Also on the second day, the Claimants indicated that it might be appropriate further to amend their RAPoC on the image prompts claim (an amendment which has since been permitted in the RRAPoC as explained above).
Given the importance of the court having a clear understanding of each side’s proposals for the management of the claim (including the proposed representative claim) to trial, I suggested that the Application be adjourned, that the parties attempt to agree in so far as possible upon how each of the Copyright Infringement Claims should be dealt with at the First Trial and that the parties then return for a third day of argument.
In advance of the resumed hearing on 26 November 2024 (“the Resumed Hearing”), the parties liaised over their individual proposals for the First Trial but were regrettably unable to reach any real agreement; indeed in a number of respects agreements apparently made in court at the Hearing appear to have been abandoned.  The parties duly produced further skeleton arguments addressing their individual contentions for the management of the Copyright Infringement Claims at trial, together with their submissions as to the impact of their respective proposals on the Application.  Each party made (very different) proposals as to the Orders the court should make for the determination of the Copyright Infringement Claims at the First Trial.  These proposals appeared to shift over the course of the Resumed Hearing and I therefore asked the parties to produce further drafts after the hearing clarifying their individual proposals as to the form of Order the court should make.  It will be necessary for me to return to these in due course.
For now, suffice to say that it appeared from the Defendant’s skeleton argument for the Resumed Hearing that the Defendant was floating the possibility that the court deal only with the Getty-owned copyright claims at the First Trial and ‘park’ the representative claim for determination at a later date.  This proposal, unheralded as it was and following two full days of court time spent arguing about the Application, came as something of a surprise.  The Claimants had been given no opportunity to consider it in advance of the Resumed Hearing and the Defendant had not even attempted properly to explain its proposal in its skeleton argument, let alone produce a draft Order setting out that proposal.  On his feet, Mr Saunders KC initially appeared to confirm that the Defendant considered a pragmatic way forward to involve dealing at trial with only what he described as “big picture points” arising in respect of the Getty-owned Copyright Works.  However, following a break during which I permitted him to take instructions on what was to happen to the Application in light of this submission, Mr Saunders confirmed that the Defendant still wanted the court to determine the Application, albeit that the Defendant wished to emphasise its position that the representative claim raises complex and difficult issues which would complicate the management of the trial and which are generally unlikely to add much, if anything, to the court’s determination of the core disputes arising in this case.
I make the preliminary observation that, whilst the way in which these submissions developed at such a late stage was unfortunate, I have considerable sympathy with the Defendant on its underlying point.  The issues in this case are highly complex and it remains a challenge on both sides to work out and to plead how they are to be addressed at trial. The Defendant was right to say in its skeleton for the Resumed Hearing that the dominant concern for the parties and the court must be to arrive at a selection of triable issues which will resolve as much of the commercial dispute between the parties as is practically possible at the First Trial in a way that is both proportionate to the dispute and fair to the court and other users of the court system.  If the Defendant had made this proposal a great deal earlier it may have been possible to manage the case accordingly, including by making provision for a means of dealing with the exclusively licensed Copyright Works after an initial determination of the “big picture points”.
Instead, however, the court must now try to deal swiftly with the difficult Application it has before it in circumstances where it often appeared during both the Hearing and the Resumed Hearing that the parties were working out their positions on the Application and on the management of the case to trial on the hoof.  With only around 6 months to trial and with the parties’ pleaded cases still subject to change and further clarification, not to mention the host of disagreements as to case management generally, I consider this to be both unfortunate and unsatisfactory.
In producing this judgment I have read and had regard to all of the parties’ submissions and evidence and I have, as necessary, revisited the daily transcripts.  For obvious reasons, I have not dealt with all of those arguments (many of which fall by the wayside in light of the decisions I have arrived at) but I have considered them and taken them all into account.
Relevant Legal Principles
Section 101 of the CDPA provides as follows:
“Rights and remedies of exclusive licensee.
An exclusive licensee has, except against the copyright owner, the same rights and remedies in respect of matters occurring after the grant of the licence as if the licence had been an assignment.
His rights and remedies are concurrent with those of the copyright owner; and references in the relevant provisions of this Part to the copyright owner shall be construed accordingly.
In an action brought by an exclusive licensee by virtue of this section a defendant may avail himself of any defence which would have been available to him if the action had been brought by the copyright owner.”
An exclusive licence is defined in section 92(1) of the CDPA as:
“A licence in writing signed by or on behalf of the copyright owner authorising the licensee to the exclusion of all other persons, including the person granting the licence, to exercise a right which would otherwise be exercisable exclusively by the copyright owner.”
Thus, the essential requirement under section 92(1) is that the licence operates to the exclusion of all other persons (including the grantor) in respect of a right that would otherwise be exercisable exclusively by the copyright owner.
Section 102 of the CDPA provides that:
“Exercise of concurrent rights
Where an action for infringement of copyright brought by the copyright owner or an exclusive licensee relates (wholly or partly) to an infringement in respect of which they have concurrent rights of action, the copyright owner or, as the case may be, the exclusive licensee may not, without the leave of the court, proceed with the action unless the other is either joined as a plaintiff or added as a defendant.
A copyright owner or exclusive licensee who is added as a defendant in pursuance of subsection (1) is not liable for any costs in the action unless he takes part in the proceedings.”
Section 102 of the CDPA is echoed by CPR r.19.3 which provides that:
All persons jointly entitled to the remedy claimed by a claimant must be parties unless the court orders otherwise.
If any person does not agree to be a claimant, he must be made a defendant, unless the court orders otherwise.”
There are, in effect, three regimes under CPR Part 19 under which multiple claimants may bring claims in one claim form and one set of proceedings: joinder (rr. 19.1 and 7.3), group litigation (r.19.21-24), and, as in this claim, representative proceedings brought under CPR r.19.8. It is of course not impossible to join very large numbers of individual claimants to one consolidated particulars of claim – they can be identified in a schedule and the claim can then be case managed sensibly so that sufficient sample claimants and claims may be determined at trial for extrapolation purposes (see Jalla v Shell International Trading and Shipping Co Limited [2021] EWCA Civ 1389, per Coulson LJ at [67]).  However, an alternative approach (subject to satisfying the relevant requirements) is to bring a representative claim under CPR r.19.8.
CPR r.19.8 provides (emphasis added):
Where more than one person has the same interest in a claim –
the claim may be begun; or
the court may order that the claim be continued, by or against one or more of the persons who have the same interest as representatives of any other persons who have that interest.
The court may direct that a person may not act as a representative.
Any party may apply to the court for an order under paragraph (2).
Unless the court otherwise directs any judgment or order given in a claim in which a party is acting as a representative under this rule –
is binding on all persons represented in the claim; but
may only be enforced by or against a person who is not a party to the claim with the permission of the court”.
The leading authority on the application of CPR r. 19.8 is Lloyd v Google [2021] UKSC 50. I can summarise the relevant principles by reference to the authoritative examination of the rule by Lord Leggatt JSC (with whom the other JJSCs agreed) in that case, together with some additional points made in the very recent judgment of Nugee LJ in Commission Recovery Limited v Marks & Clerk LLP [2024] EWCA Civ 9 (“Commission Recovery”), as follows:
The rule was devised in recognition of the fact that it is not always practically convenient to join all interested persons as parties to an action, particularly if they are numerous.  Instead of abandoning the aim of settling the rights of all interested persons in a single proceeding, the rule allows one or more claimants or defendants to represent all others who have the same interest as them.  All persons represented in this way are bound by the court’s decision.  (See Lloyd v Google at [34] and Commission Recovery at [27]).
The development of digital technologies has added to the potential for mass harm for which legal redress may be sought.  In such cases
“it is necessary to reconcile, on the one hand, the inconvenience or complete impracticality of litigating multiple individual claims with, on the other hand, the inconvenience or complete impracticality of making every prospective claimant (or defendant) a party to a single claim.  The only practical way to ‘come at justice’ is to combine the claims in a single proceeding and allow one or more persons to represent all others who share the same interest in the outcome.  When trying all the individual claims is not feasible, the adages of Lord Eldon quoted by Lord Macnaghten in Duke of Bedford v Ellis [1901] AC 1 remain as pertinent as ever: that it is better to go as far as possible towards justice than to deny it altogether and that, if you cannot realistically make everybody interested a party, you should ensure that those who are parties will ‘fairly and honestly try the right’”. (Lloyd v Google at [67]).
Thus the representative rule should be treated as “a flexible tool of convenience in the administration of justice” and “applied to the exigencies of modern life as occasion requires” (Lloyd v Google at [68]).
There is no limit under the rule to the number of people who may be represented.  The only jurisdictional requirement is that the representative “has the same interest” in the claim as the person(s) represented (Lloyd v Google at [69] and Commission Recovery at [29]).
The ‘same interest’ requirement must be interpreted purposively in light of the overriding objective and the rationale for the representative procedure (Lloyd v Google at [71]).  In practice this means that it is enough that there is a common issue (or issues) such that the representative can be relied on to conduct the litigation in a way that will effectively promote and protect the interests of all members of the represented class.  That is not possible where there is a conflict of interest between class members, i.e. where an argument which would advance the cause of some members would prejudice the position of others; but it is no impediment if the class members merely have divergent interests, i.e. where an issue may affect only some class members but advancing their case will not prejudice the position of others in the class (Lloyd v Google at [71-72] and Commission Recovery at [29]).
It is no impediment that the members of the class all technically have separate causes of action: “[t]he requirement is that they have the same interest in a claim in the sense of a common interest in one or more issues, not in the sense of a joint claim” (Commission Recovery at [30]).  However, the claims of all members of the represented class must “stand or fall on the determination of the claims of the representatives”.  The alternative is the risk of “a form of ‘rolling’ representative action, where (at least potentially) no represented party was bound by the court’s determination of anyone else’s claim” (Jalla at [60]-[61]).
It is a general principle that membership of the class “should not depend on the outcome of the litigation” (see Emerald Supplies Ltd v British Airways Plc [2011] Ch 345 per Mummery LJ at [62]-[63] and [65] and Lloyd v Google at [56] and [78]).  However, it does not matter that the number and identities of the represented parties are difficult or impossible to ascertain, or that the class is a fluctuating one (see Duke of Bedford v Ellis [1901] AC 1 per Lord Macnaghten at page 11 and Lloyd v Google at [78]).
Where the same interest requirement is satisfied, the court has a discretion whether to allow a claim to proceed as a representative action.  In exercising its discretion, the court must give effect to the overriding objective of dealing with cases justly and at proportionate cost (see CPR r.1.1(2)).  Many of the considerations specifically included in that objective “are likely to militate in favour of allowing a claim, where practicable, to be continued as a representative action rather than leaving members of the class to pursue claims individually” (Lloyd v Google at [75]).
Relevant to the exercise of the court’s discretion is the adequacy of the definition of the class of persons represented (Lloyd v Google at [78]).
It is primarily a matter for the claimant who wishes to act as a representative to identify the class which he wishes to represent (see Commission Recovery at [41]).
There is no requirement for consent, only community of interest.  Thus “there is ordinarily no need for a member of the represented class to take any positive step, or even to be aware of the existence of the action, in order to be bound by the result” (Lloyd v Google at [77]).
The representative action finds its simplest application in claims for declaratory relief.  All that is needed is for the declaration to be worded so that it applies not just to the representative claimant but to all those represented (Commission Recovery at [31]).
The fact that the relief sought is monetary is “not a bar” to a representative claim but what limits the scope for claiming damages in such an action is that the assessment of damages will ordinarily depend on the position of each individual claimant, which is something that usually necessitates an individualised assessment raising no common issue and requires participation of the individuals concerned.  A representative action is not a suitable vehicle for such an exercise. (See Lloyd v Google at [80] and Commission Recovery at [32]).
In cases where damages would require individual assessment, there may nevertheless be advantages in terms of justice and efficiency in adopting a bifurcated process – as was done in Prudential Assurance Co Ltd v Newman Industries Ltd [1981] Ch 229 – whereby common issues of law or fact are decided through a representative claim, leaving any issues which require individual determination (whether they relate to liability or the amount of damages) to be dealt with at a subsequent stage of the proceedings. (See Lloyd v Google at [47]-[48] and [81]).  At [84] Lord Leggatt observes that he could see no legitimate objection to a bifurcated process in Lloyd v Google itself.
Although claims for damages normally require an individualised assessment, and hence a bifurcated process, there may be cases in which that is not necessary – for example where the entitlement to damages can be calculated on a basis that is common to all the members of the class (see Lloyd v Google at [82] and Commission Recovery at [36]).
In Commission Recovery, the Judge at first instance refused to strike out a representative claim brought on behalf of the clients of patent attorneys in respect of undisclosed commissions for referrals to a service provider.  The Court of Appeal upheld his decision, and, having set out in detail the key principles articulated by Lord  Leggatt in Lloyd v Google, Nugee LJ went on to apply those principles to the facts of the case before him.  When dealing with the question of whether one or more issues common to all members of the identified class arose, Nugee LJ sought to identify what he described as the claimant’s “core proposition”, by which I understand him to mean the essence of the case that was being advanced, or, put another way, what the claimant needed to prove in order to establish liability. As described by Nugee LJ, if it was to establish its case in bribery and/or breach of fiduciary duty, the claimant needed to prove that, subject to two potential defences, it contracted with the defendant on its standard terms of business and that there was a payment of commission.
Nugee LJ went on to ask himself whether this was an issue which arose across the class (defined essentially as all current and former clients of the defendant that had a direct contractual relationship with the defendant on its standard terms of business from time to time) and in which members of the class had the same interest.  He answered this question in the affirmative, saying at [51] “[i]f CRL is right and establishes its core proposition, I see no difficulty in the Court so declaring, and it seems to me self-evident that such a declaration would be equally beneficial to every member of the class”. He went on to explain at [52] that it did not matter that, even if the claimant succeeded in obtaining such a declaration, it would not resolve all the issues in the case, even on liability.  These other issues (including disclosure, informed consent and limitation, as well as relief) might well require an individualised assessment, but it was “not an impediment to the use of a representative action that not all issues can be resolved on a class basis”.  The fact that issues would remain which might require individual determination (including issues of liability and quantum) was “not a bar to resolving common issues through a representative claim”.
Furthermore, Nugee LJ expressed the view that “it does not matter how many members of the class will ultimately benefit from a declaration” (see [54]) and that it does not matter that the claimant might be wrong in its core proposition (see [55]).  In addition, Nugee LJ rejected the suggestion that there was anything wrong in “salami slicing” liability so as to enable common issues to be determined on a representative basis even if they do not lead to a conclusion on liability.   In addition to the core proposition, Nugee LJ also noted that there seemed to him to be no objection in principle to deciding at a representative stage “the common issue whether, as a matter of principle, the precise circumstances of [the defendant’s] retainer, or the client’s knowledge of market practice, are available as an answer to the claim, even though (if the answer were Yes) the question of liability to any particular client would remain to be resolved at a subsequent stage”.
I have looked at Commission Recovery in some detail because, during the course of submissions, I asked the Claimants to identify their “core proposition”.  This prompted the production of a Note on the second day of the Hearing, in which they denied the need to establish a core proposition but, on the assumption that they were wrong about that, they identified as their core proposition: “[w]hether the copyright in an artistic or film work has been infringed by the Defendant as a result of Stable Diffusion having been trained on those works?”.
The Claimants submit that the level of generality at which this core proposition is formulated is acceptable because it does not give rise to a conflict of interest.  Specifically they say that it does not matter that the acts of infringement alleged are different and encompass a number of individual claims, because in advancing any one of these claims the Sixth Claimant will not prejudice the position of those advancing the other claims.  The class definition would be as pleaded in the Further Information.
Alternatively, the Claimants submit that if a greater level of granularity is required, then their alternative core propositions would be:
Whether the Defendant has committed acts of secondary infringement of copyright by importing Stable Diffusion into the UK, otherwise than for private and domestic use, and/or possessing Stable Diffusion in the course of its business, or selling or letting it for hire, or offering or exposing it for sale or hire, in circumstances where artistic and/or film works were downloaded, stored or copied during the training and development of Stable Diffusion;
Whether the Defendant has committed acts of primary infringement of copyright by downloading, storing or copying artistic and/or film works in the UK during the training and development of Stable Diffusion; and
Whether the Defendant has committed acts of primary infringement of copyright by authorising the reproduction and/or communication to the public of a substantial part of artistic and/or film works by users of the image-to-image feature of Stable Diffusion in the UK.
If this greater level of granularity is required, the Claimants concede that the text prompts claim cannot proceed by way of a representative claim. Instead, say the Claimants, permission should be given to the Claimants to proceed with that claim without joinder pursuant to CPR 19.3; alternatively, the owners of the copyright in the six exclusively licensed works could be joined as claimants or defendants.  I infer, for reasons to which I shall return, that this concession also applies to the image plus text prompts claim.
For present purposes I observe that I do not consider that Nugee LJ was intending to elevate his search for a “core proposition” to a legal requirement or that he was seeking to add an additional element to the test of “same interest”.  Instead, it seems to me that he was merely adopting the concept of a “core proposition” as a means of focusing on whether the case raised core issues which were capable of being common issues which could be tried on a representative basis. In my judgment this is a helpful way of thinking about what the common issues might be and whether their determination is likely to benefit the entirety of the identified class.
Application of the principles to this case
Taking my cue from the approach of Nugee LJ in Commission Recovery at [39]-[40], the court must consider two questions: (i) is this case within the rule at all? And (ii) if so, should the court nevertheless in its discretion direct that the Sixth Claimant may not act as representative?  The first question depends upon two points; do the claims of each member of the class raise a common issue or issues and is there any relevant conflict of interest between them?
To this I would add that it seems to me to be necessary (certainly in this case) to consider at an early stage whether the members of the class are capable of being satisfactorily identified at all.  It is common ground that it is for the Sixth Claimant to define the class which it wishes to represent (Commission Recovery at [41]). Although the adequacy of the definition of the class is a matter that goes to the court’s discretion, the question of whether members of the class have “the same interest” can only be addressed on the assumption that it is clear that any particular person qualifies for membership of the class.  As Mummery LJ said in Emerald at [62], “[a]t all stages of the proceedings, and not just the date of judgment at the end, it must be possible to say of any particular person whether or not they qualify for membership of the represented class of persons by virtue of having “the same interest” as [the representative claimant]”.
Do the claims of the members of the class raise a common issue or issues?
By way of reminder, Getty’s proposed class definition in its Further Information is as follows:
“…the class of persons represented by the Sixth Claimant are those who are owners of the copyright subsisting in artistic works and film works that have been licensed on an exclusive basis to the First Claimant, the copyright in which has been infringed by the Defendant.  The persons that fall within such class can be identified on the basis that (i) they have entered into an exclusive licence with the First Claimant in respect of artistic works and/or film works; and (ii) the exclusively licensed works include works which were used to train Stable Diffusion…”.
On the first day of the Hearing, the Claimants provided a supplemental skeleton addressing various criticisms made by the Defendant as to this class definition and suggesting an amendment to (i) above to read “they have entered into an exclusive licence with the First Claimant in respect of artistic works and of film works in which they own copyright”.  I note that this wording in fact ties in with the relief sought by the Sixth Claimant on behalf of the Represented Parties as set out in the Further Information.
As a yet further fall-back position, in their skeleton for the Resumed Hearing, the Claimants proposed that they at least be permitted “to take representative proceedings on the basis of specific agreements”.  Accordingly they proposed that the class definition should cover all exclusive licensors under Contributor Agreements #14 to 19 on the basis that they are in “essentially the same form as Contributor Agreement #17”.  However, they observed that the Defendant’s apparent acceptance in submissions at the Hearing of the possibility of representative proceedings brought on behalf of exclusive licensors under a specific agreement demonstrates that there is nothing intrinsically wrong with representative proceedings in this case and that “in reality all agreements should be included in the class definition, which is effectively the Claimants’ primary position”.
The Defendant’s primary objection to the class definition originally proposed by the Claimants in their Further Information is that it is dependent upon a disputed issue in the litigation, namely whether copyright in the exclusively licensed Copyright Works has been infringed by the Defendant.  The Defendant contends that this is an impermissibly circular definition and that a judgment on liability would have to be obtained before it is known whether the interests of the persons whom the Sixth Claimant seeks to represent are the same (see Emerald Supplies at [65]).  The Defendant denies that the amendment suggested on the first day of the Hearing to add some additional wording resolves this problem.
By way of response, the Claimants say that the fact that there may be a dispute as to whether a particular individual meets the criteria for membership does not mean that the definition of the class suffers from the same objection as applied in Emerald.  They emphasise that their proposed class definition does not depend upon the outcome of the litigation but is premised upon “objective facts”, i.e. is there an exclusive licence and was the Copyright Work used for the training of Stable Diffusion?  Further, they pray in aid Duke of Bedford v Ellis [1901] AC 1, for the proposition that merely because the class definition includes “an element of the cause of action does not mean that the class definition does not work”.
In my judgment, there can be little doubt that the first sentence of the class definition identified in the Further Information is entirely dependent upon the outcome of the proceedings – the question of whether copyright has been infringed by the Defendant being a question that can only be determined at trial.  Thus, if the class is dependent upon this definition, it appears to me plainly to fall foul of the principle in Emerald.
I am not persuaded that the class definition in Duke of Bedford v Ellis assists the Claimants in this regard.  In that case, the class was “growers of fruit, flowers, vegetables, roots or herbs within the meaning of the Covent Garden Market Act 1828”.  The question of whether individuals falling within this class had certain statutory rights was a matter which could only be determined at trial (the common issue in that case being whether growers within the meaning of the 1828 Act had those rights), but that did not mean that the class could not be identified at an earlier time, even though the composition of the class was subject to fluctuation – the composition of the relevant class was independent of the outcome of the action.
In the present case, however, the question of whether Copyright Works have been infringed cannot define the class because inclusion in the class would obviously depend on the outcome of the action.  In that sense the proposal in the first sentence of the class definition is analogous to that in Emerald where the proposed representative claim was to be on behalf of all direct and indirect purchasers of air freight services affected by the alleged price fixing, i.e. dependent upon the success of the action.  As Mr Bond correctly observes in his statement, “[f]ollowing a decision on the representative claim, to work out whether or not an individual or entity is part of the represented class (and therefore has the benefit of the judgment), it would be necessary to work out on an individual basis if their relevant right had been infringed.  Conversely, if the claim fails and is dismissed, it would not be possible to work out which parties the judgment is binding on for res judicata purposes: the represented class would by definition have no members”.  A similar point was made in Lloyd v Google at [56] and in Commission Recovery at [64].
However, this difficulty with the class definition appears to have been recognised by the Claimants, because in Rose 9, Mr Rose disavows any intention that membership of the class should depend upon a finding of infringement by the court.  Instead he focuses on the second sentence of the class definition identified in the Further Information.  As I understood Ms Lane’s submissions at the Hearing, this was also her focus.  Specifically she emphasised that (i) the question of whether persons have entered into an exclusive licence with the First Claimant in respect of artistic works or film works and (ii) the question of whether those works have been used for the training of Stable Diffusion, are both matters of objective fact, capable of ascertainment in advance of trial.
Although I have no difficulty in accepting that the question of whether an individual has entered into an exclusive licence with the First Claimant in respect of an artistic work is quite obviously a question which is independent of the outcome of the trial (and I did not understand the Defendant to suggest otherwise), I find the second aspect of this proposed definition more difficult.  As Rose 9 explains, there is no definitive list of the Copyright Works that have been used to train Stable Diffusion and the Defendant has only made limited admissions in its Amended Defence to the effect that “at least some” images from the Getty Images Websites and/or some Copyright Works were used in training Stable Diffusion and that “at least some” LAION-Subsets contain URLs referencing images on the Getty Images Websites.
Indeed Bond 6 makes clear that the Defendant’s admissions “do not extend to admissions that one or more of the works of each of the 50,000 (of unknown identity) authors that have licensed content to the First Claimant has been used to train Stable Diffusion”.  Mr Bond goes on to explain that different filters were applied to produce each of the LAION-Subsets created during the training of Stable Diffusion.  Thus, he says that “whether or not a given work was actually used to train Stable Diffusion would be wholly dependent on its own facts”.  This is consistent with the Amended Defence which pleads (at paragraph 64.5) that “[t]he particular images used will depend on the starting dataset and the filters applied to it for each training run”.  Mr Bond says that, in the circumstances “[t]he Claimants would need to establish that one or more works of each author were in fact (i) downloaded; (ii) by the Defendant; and (iii) in the UK”.  He observes that “[t]his is not something which can be established for a whole class of licensors and a myriad of works by considering the works of just one allegedly representative…licensor”.
To my mind this evidence is persuasive.  There seems to be no way at present to identify the members of the class and Mr Rose himself acknowledges that the enormous number of images in the Training Dataset(s), as well as the enormous number of Copyright Works in issue, mean that in practice the exercise of trying to determine which works within the Training Dataset(s) are Copyright Works “would be wholly disproportionate and practically impossible without significant resources”.
As Mr Rose also points out, however, the subset of Copyright Works used to train Stable Diffusion is a matter within the Defendant’s own knowledge and, to date, it has  failed to identify how many images from the Getty Images Websites were in fact used to train Stable Diffusion and which images those were.  This state of affairs has led to the Claimants raising the following proposed disclosure issues in the DRD, namely: “8. How was Stable Diffusion trained, including…How many Visual Assets and Copyright Works were used in the training of Stable Diffusion 1.0 [and Stable Diffusion 2.0 and Stable Diffusion XL]”.  This issue (which maps on to the Claimants’ proposed issues for trial and is disputed) was on the list of matters also to be dealt with, time permitting, at the hearing of the Application.  As drafted, it does not, of course, address the question of which Copyright Works were in fact used to train Stable Diffusion.  However, in their skeleton argument for the Resumed Hearing, the Claimants asserted that if the court were to accept the Defendant’s complaint that it is not possible to identify people whose exclusively licensed Copyright Works were used to train Stable Diffusion, then “the Claimants would need disclosure not only of how many works were used in training, but which ones” (emphasis added).
Following a suggestion from the parties that this might be something on which they could liaise further in correspondence with a view to agreeing a way forward, I made an order at the Resumed Hearing to that effect.  The upshot, though, is that there is no consensus as to how (if at all) the question of which Copyright Works have been used to train Stable Diffusion should be resolved, whether it can be done by way of sample, how that might play into the representative claim, whether it could be addressed at the First Trial, or anything else.  The Defendant has accepted in its Defence that the questions of authorship, subsistence and infringement may be resolved by reference to the Sample Works (and this certainly provides a means of determining some of the key issues between the parties, albeit apparently not in relation to the image prompts claim which does not seek to rely on the Sample Works, even as representative examples), but it has expressly made no wider admissions as to any other Copyright Works owned by exclusive licensors and there are at present no proposals as to how these should be dealt with.
Standing back, and trying to see the wood for the trees, it is plain that the question of which Copyright Works have been used for training Stable Diffusion is not a question that can currently be determined.  Indeed this does not appear, at present even to be a question which the parties had anticipated would need to be resolved at the First Trial, albeit the Claimants belatedly appear to acknowledge its significance in connection with the proposed representative claim. It is also plain that the class that is intended to be defined by reference to this question cannot be identified.  The Order of 6 December 2024 requires the parties to liaise on the disclosure issue, but, if the Defendant maintains its position, then an individualised assessment of the use, if any, made by the Defendant of each exclusive licensors’ Copyright Works in training Stable Diffusion will be required simply to determine whether they fall within the class and thus have a claim for infringement.  While it is possible that this issue could be dealt with by way of sampling and extrapolation, there is as yet no suggestion as to how this might be done.
In the circumstances I can see no basis on which the court can be satisfied that any particular person qualifies as a member of the class proposed or that it therefore has jurisdiction to permit this representative claim.
Even if I am wrong about this from a jurisdictional perspective, I am not persuaded in the exercise of my discretion that the proposed representative claim should be permitted to proceed to trial – certainly not on the information I have to date.  The adequacy of the definition also goes to the exercise of my discretion in deciding whether it is just and convenient to allow the claim to be continued on a representative basis (see Lloyd v Google at [78]), and for the reasons I have set out above, there are serious problems around the definition of the class which play directly into the management of this case to trial.  The parties are still discussing how the court should be invited to deal with the issue of which Copyright Works were used to train Stable Diffusion.  As yet I have no proposals on that front, no idea as to whether any proposals that might be advanced are likely to be agreed and no clear understanding of how any proposals that are agreed (or subsequently approved by way of court order) are likely to impact on the trial.    Furthermore, Rose 9 confirms that in circumstances where the Claimants do not know which Copyright Works were used and/or reproduced in the UK during the training and development of Stable Diffusion they are “unable to finalise a proposal for how the issue of subsistence and ownership in relation to the Training and Development claim should be tried”.
It would not be consistent with the requirements of the overriding objective to permit a representative claim in the absence of clear proposals (or indeed a clear understanding) as to how it will be dealt with at trial, whether samples will be used and extrapolated across the class and whether, and if so, how, any individualised assessments that may be required are to be bifurcated.  Whilst I appreciate that in many cases the considerations included in the overriding objective are likely to militate in favour of allowing a representative claim, I cannot see how that can be the case where the court remains essentially in the dark as to what exactly is proposed, including as to the trial itself (an issue that comes into sharp focus given the proximity to the First Trial).  Equally I cannot see that the court can make a reasoned assessment of the question of whether allowing a representative action to go forward would promote access to justice unless it has a better understanding of what is being proposed.  I simply have no means at present of balancing the relevant competing interests.
As things stand I certainly cannot be satisfied that the representative claim will remove the need for an expensive and time consuming individualised assessment of numerous issues of liability and quantum relating to the proposed Represented Parties, or that this will not also create a very significant case management burden for the court.  In this context I note that during her submissions Ms Lane said this: “following the trial on liability you would have to work out potentially the membership of the class, the question of ownership and then would proceed to determine the question of relief and have the damages inquiry and so on” – an observation which rather makes my point.  Of course, one way of addressing this issue might be by way of an appropriate sampling regime, together with cooperation between the parties over how any such regime could be extrapolated across the universe of potential claimants (or an appropriate order from the court).  Indeed, Ms Lane immediately went on to say that even though “there would be more going on after the trial…you would still expect that that would happen by way of sample”.  However, there are of course no concrete proposals as to this at present and thus no means of knowing whether extrapolation across a particular class is likely to be viable.
In their skeleton argument for the Resumed Hearing, the Claimants accepted that where the Defendant plainly intends to run arguments on the interpretation of the various exclusive licences (including as to foreign law) the question of permission to take that course “cannot be decided by the court in the absence of draft amended pleadings”, just as until the position on the pleadings is decided, “there can be no decision on whether the arguments on exclusive licences (if permitted to be made) should be decided by reference to a sample and, if so, what sample”.  But the fact that the complexities of this case quite obviously call for pragmatic solutions in the form of sampling, as the Claimants contend, is not a reason to permit a representative claim where it is entirely unclear at present how that sampling is to proceed and (more importantly) whether it is even possible.
Strictly, this deals with the Application and there is no need for me to address any of the remaining arguments advanced on each side in relation to it.  The proposed and pleaded class definition does not identify a class with common interests.  For the sake of completeness, however, I should address two additional points arising in argument: first an argument from the Defendant to the effect that different issues arise in respect of each Copyright Infringement Claim such that, if a representative claim were to be considered, it is necessary to understand the issues arising in respect of each of those claims; and second the Claimants’ belated proposal for a different class definition.
As to the former, I observe that, to my mind, the exercise of inviting the Claimants to identify their core propositions has exposed the extent to which a proposition at the very high level of generality proposed by the Claimants is incapable of satisfying the requirement that all members of the proposed class have the same interest.
A declaration of copyright infringement in relation to, say, the text prompts claim alone would not be equally beneficial to every member of the class because that claim is confined specifically to a limited number of examples authored by a limited number of individuals (not including the Sixth Claimant). The allegation (made in the text prompts claim) that an output from Stable Diffusion infringes copyright in a specifically identified Getty Copyright Work requires a comparison of the output obtained to the Copyright Work to determine whether the former reproduces a substantial part of the latter.  This is quite obviously an individualised case-by-case assessment, as appears to have been recognised by the Claimants who have now identified only 17 Copyright Works on which they rely for the purposes of this assessment.
It is not Getty’s case that the use of a particular Getty Copyright Work to train one or more Stable Diffusion models necessarily gives rise to outputs from those models (when a text prompt is used) that resemble and therefore infringe that Copyright Work.  Importantly, as the Claimants appear now to accept, when considered on its own merits rather than by reference to a generic proposition, the text prompts claim is not a claim that could be advanced as a representative claim by the Sixth Claimant owing to the fact that the Sixth Claimant is not said to be the exclusive licensor of any of the 17 Copyright Works on which the Claimants rely in the Amended SOCI.  There is no suggestion that the Sixth Claimant even has a text prompts claim and there cannot be any issue arising in that claim in respect of which it has the same interest as the rightsholders who do have such claims.  There can certainly be no suggestion that the claims of all members of the represented class can “stand or fall on the determination of the claims of the representatives” (see Jalla v Shell International Trading and Shipping Co Ltd [2021] EWCA Civ 1389, per Coulson LJ at [60]).
What is key is that the interests of the proposed Represented Parties are common.  As the Claimants now accept, there is no core proposition that can be identified (at this level of granularity) in relation to the text prompts claim that could be pursued by the Sixth Claimant as representative or that would give rise to a declaration which would be equally beneficial to every member of the proposed class.  If there is no benefit to all, there cannot be the same interest in the claim.
In the circumstances, I do not consider the Claimants’ approach of relying only upon a very high level proposition is appropriate.  Such an approach might be said to mask the scope for argument over the lack of any real common interest, alternatively the existence of conflict.  In my judgment it is important to focus at a more granular level (as Nugee LJ did in Commission Recovery) on the issues arising in respect of the pleaded claims before a decision can be made on whether those claims are capable of being brought as representative claims.  That is not to say that represented parties must have the same claims, but they must, as is confirmed by the authorities, have a common interest in issues that arise in the claims.  Here there is quite simply no common interest in any issue which arises in the text prompts claim.
Although not addressed by the Claimants in their Note on Core Propositions, I infer that their concession in relation to the text prompts claim must apply equally to the image plus text prompts claim.  Looking closely at the pleaded case, the new RRAPoC pleads that “[i]n the case of an image entered by a user with a text command, in the circumstances identified in paragraphs 21A, 21B and 22 to 24 of Section C of the SOCI, the synthetic image output comprises the whole or a substantial part of one or more of the Copyright Works and/or Visual Assets” (emphasis added).  Paragraph 21A of the SOCI pleads that the Claimants “rely upon the infringing Outputs attached at Annex F hereto”.  These infringing outputs (of which there are various examples) relate only to five specific Copyright Works, A2, A3, A8, A14 and A16.  The image plus text prompts claim thus appears to be restricted solely to these examples, none of which is authored by the Sixth Claimant.  Just as the text prompts claim could not possibly  proceed by way of a representative claim, in my judgment and for the same reasons, the image plus text prompts claim also could not proceed by way of a representative claim.  The Sixth Claimant does not have an image plus text prompts claim and there is no core proposition that can be identified in relation to the image plus text prompts claim that would give rise to a declaration which would be equally beneficial to every member of the proposed class.
Finally, I have considered whether I should deal with the alternative proposal made by the Claimants as to the definition of the class by reference to exclusive licensors who had signed up to Contributor Agreements #14 to 19.  Although this is a new case, not previously advanced, I recognise that it is in many ways a proposal which aligns with the first limb of the Claimants’ pleaded class definition, which I have dealt with in detail above.  It is certainly a proposal that, in my judgment, ought to involve no difficulties over the identification of the class.  In oral submissions, Ms Lane explained that it was put forward on the basis that Contributor Agreements #14 to 19 are in essentially the same form as Contributor Agreement #17 and that Contributor Agreements #14 to 19 were all the agreements that were “currently pleaded”.
I have wavered over this point but in the end I have decided that where this proposal was only raised at the Resumed Hearing without notice to the Defendant, it is neither fair nor consistent with the overriding objective to permit it.  I reject the suggestion that the Defendant itself argued at the Hearing that this would be an acceptable class definition for representative proceedings; rather its point was that (until the Resumed Hearing) the Claimants had not even attempted to formulate a class definition along these lines.
I recognise that it is possible that a representative claim (at least in relation to the image prompts claim, the Training and Development Claim and the Secondary Infringement Claim) might be capable of being pursued on the basis of a class of exclusive licensors under specifically identified agreements.  However, that is not the way that the Claimant has currently advanced its case on the pleadings and it is not consistent with the Claimants’ evidence.  The Defendant is entitled to know the case that it must meet in pursuit of its Application and should not be presented with a moving target.  That is particularly so where the Claimants have the carriage of the representative claim and where the responsibility for formulating that claim, including the identification of the class definition, rests solely with them.
Further, and decisively, it appears to me that amending the class definition in this way (even if such late amendment creates, in reality, no prejudice to the Defendant) will not improve the very serious uncertainties surrounding the management of the case that I have identified above.  As things stand, the lack of clarity around so many of the central issues in this case, combined with the lack of any satisfactory proposals as to how a representative action would proceed and the swiftly advancing trial date militate strongly against an order for a representative action.   Accordingly, even assuming a commonality of interests, my ultimate decision on the exercise of my discretion in relation to this proposed alternative class definition would be no different from my decision on the pleaded class definition and representative claim.
CPR 19.3
Where I have refused permission for a representative claim, should I nevertheless accede to the Claimants’ alternative proposal (in respect of which they have made no formal application) that the court permit them to pursue their claims in the absence of joinder of owners of Copyright Works with whom they have concurrent rights of action, pursuant to CPR 19.3 and section 102(1) CDPA?
I have already set out the text of these provisions above and there is very little in the way of notes in the White Book to provide assistance on the circumstances in which the court might exercise its discretion to take this course.  Indeed there seem to be very few decided cases on the point.
The Claimants drew my attention to Noel Redding Estate Ltd v Sony Music Entertainment UK Ltd [2024] EWHC 128 (Ch) in which Michael Green J refused to strike out a claim for infringement of copyright in sound recordings notwithstanding that (amongst other things) the claimants had failed to join all owners of the copyright.  There was no proposal in the case that the claim should proceed as a representative claim.  At [33] the Judge observed that “the rule is directed at protecting defendants from being subject to subsequent claims for the same relief” and he went on to say at [38] that in the circumstances of that case it was appropriate to see whether all the owners of the copyright wished to be joined, but, in the event that they did not so wish, there would be no prejudice to the Defendant.
The Claimants contend that if this court refuses to permit a representative claim then the interests of justice can only be served by the grant of permission under CPR r.19.3(1). However, there is nothing in their evidence to support this proposition beyond an indication at the end of Rose 9 that absent permission for the representative claim “the court will be invited to give permission for the action to continue under CPR 19.3(1) on the basis of proportionality”.
In their submissions at the original Hearing, the Claimants explained this “proportionality” point, submitting that the joinder of many more parties was only likely to place a huge burden on all existing parties and the court.  They also maintained that (unlike in the Noel Redding case where it was feasible to ask the owners of the copyright whether they wished to be joined) it would not be proportionate in this case, given the enormous number of exclusive licensors, to take such a step.  On the subject of prejudice to the Defendant, the Claimants submitted that any concerns on the part of the Defendant as to its exposure to future claims were met by the existence of the Right To Control Claims Clause in the Contributor Agreement, which Ms Lane submitted was “good enough” to protect the Defendant from further proceedings. The Claimants contend that the effect of this clause (which is in slightly different forms in different versions of the Contributor Agreement) is that the Represented Parties cannot themselves bring proceedings for copyright infringement relating to Content they have exclusively licensed to the First Claimant.
In response, the Defendant complains that this informal application has been raised very late in the day and that it provides no comfort that the Defendant will be protected from future claims by exclusive licensors.  It submits that where the CPR has provided a particular mechanism for a representative claim under CPR r.19.8, it would be “an error of principle” to treat CPR r.19.3 as a safety net to deal with a case where the requirements of CPR r.19.8 have not been met.
I start from the proposition, which is not, I think, disputed, that the sheer number of exclusive licence holders with potential claims arising by reason of their concurrent right of action in respect of the Defendant’s alleged infringements raises very particular challenges.  Rose 8 says that “it would be practically impossible, and in any event disproportionate, to join every single owner of the Copyright Works to these proceedings” and I did not understand the Defendant to suggest otherwise.  In circumstances where I have refused to permit a representative claim, this quite obviously raises very real issues for the Claimants, and for the court, as to how the claims of the exclusive licensees are to be tried in the most effective and proportionate manner.
I reject the Defendant’s submission that a failure in relation to CPR r.19.8 necessarily precludes a party from relying upon CPR r.19.3.  These are different rules with different requirements.  If the Claimants can persuade me to exercise my discretion under CPR r.19.3 I fail to see that I am precluded from doing so merely because of the decision I have made on CPR r.19.8.  However, I agree with Mr Saunders that it is important to bear in mind how the claim has been put to date and to look to see whether the evidence served by the Claimants supports the new proposed approach under CPR r.19.3.
It is true that there is presently no pleading as to the Right To Control Claims Clause in the exclusive licences (the main ground for the Claimants’ assertion that there can be no real prejudice to the Defendant by an order under CPR r.19.3).  However, I do not consider this point to carry the day.  I bear in mind that “pleadings are intended to aid in the just resolution of disputes, not obstruct their just resolution” (Commission Recovery at [69]).  While I would expect to see a properly pleaded case in due course, the key question concerns whether there is likely to be any prejudice to the Defendant by reason of this proposal and that could have been addressed by way of evidence.
But, until Rose 9, there was no suggestion of any application under CPR r.19.3 and no formal application has ever been made.  There is no evidence from the Claimants which expressly goes to the question of likely prejudice to the Defendant in the event of the court granting permission under CPR r.19.3. Instead, the question of prejudice has been dealt with in submissions which have developed over time, particularly as to the Right To Control Claims Clause as it appears in various agreements.
In my judgment, however, and given the potential ramifications for the Defendant of so many exclusive licensors subsequently “vexing” the Defendant with fresh proceedings, the court is entitled to expect proper evidence addressing this point.
Absent such evidence, I agree with the Defendant that this is simply not an application that the court can possibly accede to at this stage.  The “touchstone” is prejudice to the Defendant by reason of the potential for further claims and the Claimants have failed to serve evidence from which the court can gain comfort on this score.
Although it appears to be the case that various of the disclosed licence agreements contain a Right To Control Claims Clause, the Defendant correctly points out that it is not a party to these agreements and cannot enforce them; the Claimants do not propose to seek undertakings from the exclusive licensors to the effect that they will not make claims against the Defendant.  In any event the Defendant has not even seen the whole universe of licences that the Claimants contend are in the scope of these proceedings – not least because the Claimants were only required to disclose licences which were common to more than 500 Represented Parties. The agreements that have been disclosed appear to be subject to New York law or Alberta law such that there may, or may not, be issues of foreign law that apply to the enforceability of the relevant provision.  Furthermore, it is now plain from a footnote to the Claimants’ skeleton for the Resumed Hearing that some licence agreements have Right To Control Claims Clauses in different forms and some licences do not have Right To Control Claims Clauses at all.  Where that is the case, it is now accepted by the Claimants that “Copyright Works owned by licensors with these agreements would have to be excluded [from] the proceedings if permission were given pursuant to CPR 19.3”.
In all the circumstances I do not consider it to be appropriate, as things stand, to grant permission under CPR r.19.3 and section 102(1) of the CDPA 1988.  I do not consider that such permission would be consistent with the requirements of the overriding objective, including dealing fairly with this case and ensuring that the parties are on an equal footing.
The Terms of the Order
In light of my findings I invite the parties now to cooperate in preparing a draft Order which reflects my decisions and which dovetails with the Order of 6 December 2024.  The Order should direct that the Sixth Claimant may not act as a representative (although it may of course remain in the proceedings as a claimant in its own right).  The Order should also dismiss the Claimants’ informal application for permission under CPR r.19.3.
Although each party has already provided me with draft proposed Orders dealing with case management, on reflection I do not consider it to be appropriate to finalise an order dealing with the case management consequences of my decisions without further recourse to the parties.  By way of guidance, however, I observe:
First, in relation to the Output Claims alleging infringement by use of text prompts and image plus text prompts, I see no reason why these should not proceed on the basis of the 17 Copyright Works (text prompts) and 5 Copyright Works (image plus text prompts) relied upon in the SOCI, subject either to the limited number of exclusive licensors of any of these works which are not owned by Getty being joined to the claim (either as claimants or non-participating defendants under section 102(2) CDPA), or to undertakings being provided from each exclusive licensor not to bring its own claim against the Defendant, in which case I shall permit an application that they need not be joined under CPR r.19.3 and section 102(1) CDPA.
This reflects a proposal made by the Defendant’s solicitors in a letter to the Claimants’ solicitors dated 20 November 2024 and appears to me to represent a pragmatic way of enabling the Claimants to pursue the text prompts claim and the image plus text prompts claim by reference to the limited number of Copyright Works on which they now seek to rely.  I can see no reason to think that the Defendant will be in any way prejudiced in either scenario; on the contrary it will be protected from being the subject of subsequent claims by third parties for the same relief.  Furthermore I cannot see that either solution places an inappropriate burden on the Claimants (Footnote: 5).  Ultimately, however, I leave it to the Claimants to determine whether they wish to adopt either of these options.  If not, then these claims must proceed as envisaged in paragraph 2 of the draft Order provided by the Defendant.
Second, I expect the parties to be able to agree on paragraph 1(a) of the Order in respect of the Training and Development Claim in light of the agreed position arrived at during the hearing.  In light of my decisions in relation to CPR r.19.8 and CPR r.19.3, I do not consider it to be appropriate to include in the Order a paragraph in the terms proposed by the Claimants at paragraph 2 to their proposed draft Order.
Third, I do not presently see why the Secondary Infringement Claim may not proceed by reference both to Sample Works A to D (which are owned by the First Claimant) and Sample Works E to K.  The latter have been exclusively licensed by the Sixth Claimant to the First Claimant and the Sixth Claimant remains a party to the proceedings.   This has the advantage that points that the Defendant wishes to raise in relation to CA#17 (or any other licence agreements that are said to cover the Sixth Claimant) may be raised at the First Trial – always subject to those points being properly pleaded.
Conclusion
Notwithstanding that the Claimants have ultimately been unsuccessful in convincing the court to permit the representative claim, it is abundantly clear that the difficulties I have identified are not intractable and that a pragmatic way forward must be found which does not involve the joinder of 50,000 potential claimants.  It is a function of the way in which the CPR r.19.3 application has been pursued that I have determined it to be unfair to make the order sought.  However, that does not mean that such an order could not be obtained upon the service of appropriate evidence and I have no intention of shutting the Claimants out from applying again, if they wish to do so.
Indeed, in many ways an order under CPR 19.3 would make very good sense.  With such an order there would be no need to identify common issues or to consider bifurcating the trial.  The issues arising on the claim could potentially be dealt with by sample (agreed by the parties or imposed by the court) and the focus could be on the “big picture” issues.  There would be no need (as Mr Saunders accepts) to open up what he describes as “Pandora’s box” of exclusive licences – i.e. the true interpretation of their individual terms. There would also be no need for anyone other than the First Claimant to pursue the claims; the Sixth Claimant would not need to be involved, because his sole role is as representative of the Represented Parties.  It is not the Claimants’ case, as I understand it, that it is necessary to introduce all the complexity potentially associated with the exclusively licensed works in order fairly to determine the core issues in this case at trial.
The Claimants contend in their skeleton for the Resumed Hearing that “it is clear that Getty Images has the exclusive right to control proceedings related to the licensed works”.  Moreover that “there is no provision which allows the licensor to bring proceedings if Getty Images has elected not to do so”.  No doubt by way of testing this proposition, the Defendant suggested that the Claimants might provide an undertaking to indemnify the Defendant against all damages, legal costs and other expenses that it might incur as a result of a subsequent claim brought by an exclusive licensee.  Ms Lane’s response to this suggestion was that this had been considered but “the clauses are themselves so clear” that an undertaking was “not necessary”. The Claimants subsequently confirmed after the Resumed Hearing that they were not prepared to provide undertakings of the sort suggested.
It is not for the court to tell the Claimants how they should proceed, but I merely observe that at the heart of this debate lies a very simple issue as to the apportionment of risk.  If they are to convince the court to make a CPR r.19.3 order the Claimants will need to satisfy it that there is no risk to the Defendant of future claims.  If, as they say, there really is no risk of future claims because the wording of the relevant clauses is clear, it is difficult to see what possible downside there could be to Getty taking that risk by the provision of the proposed, or a similar, undertaking – even if it be purely by reference to an identified subset of agreements.  I note Mr Saunders’ indication that: “if their case is they can do the whole thing without recourse to these parties because they are not people entitled to the remedy in themselves, following the licence agreements they have executed, then…we do not care.  Off we go with Getty”.  Accordingly it would appear that, subject to appropriate comfort being provided, the Defendant would be inclined to consent to an order under CPR r.19.3.
An alternative approach might be for the Claimants to narrow the universe of Represented Parties in a way that allows a reasonably circumscribed and manageable set of legal determinations to read across the whole.  As I understand the Defendant’s submissions, this was not, in theory, a solution to which they would necessarily be averse.
In any event, it is imperative that the parties now seek to resolve, as quickly as possible, the serious case management issues that have been exposed by the making of the Application and that they find a way of taking this case forward to the First Trial in June on the basis of a realistic and manageable set of issues.  I have already determined that further case management conferences are to take place in January and March 2025 with a view to ensuring that ongoing, tight, case management is possible.  At the very least I shall expect by then to see final proposals from both sides for the management of the case to trial, together with a list of issues for trial.
(Footnote reference from: 1)  The Output Claim also involves a claim of database right infringement in relation to the Database (as defined in the APoC) by way of certain synthesised image outputs of Stable Diffusion.  However, for present purposes the reference to the Output Claim is only to the Copyright Infringement Claim as identified here.
(Footnote reference from: 2)  The representative claim has been included in the Particulars of Claim since 12 May 2023.
(Footnote reference from: 3)  The Sample Works were unchanged in the RAPoC.
(Footnote reference from: 4)  These were first said to be “representative” of a wider infringement, then they were said to be “examples” and now it is accepted that the 17 Copyright Works are the only works on which the Claimants intend to rely to prove the text prompts claim.
(Footnote reference from: 5)  In their skeleton for the Resumed Hearing, the Claimants suggested that obtaining undertakings for the purposes of the Secondary Infringement Claim, the image prompts claim and the Training and Development Claim would be “entirely disproportionate” owing to the number of exclusive licensors involved.  There was no similar submission in relation to the text prompts and the image plus text prompts claims.

JUDGE BRIDGET SANGER

CALLUM PATRICK NOLAN
Appellant
and
REGISTRAR FOR APPROVED DRIVING INSTRUCTORS
Respondent
Decision: The appeal is dismissed.
REASONS
Introduction
This is an appeal against a decision of the Registrar of Approved Driving Instructors (‘the Registrar’), made on 8 August 2024, to refuse to grant the Appellant a third trainee licence.
Legal Framework
The grant of a trainee licence enables applicants to provide instruction for payment before they are qualified.
A trainee licence may be granted in the circumstances set out in s. 129 of the Road Traffic Act 1988 (‘the Act’) and the Motor Cars (Driving Instruction) Regulations 2005.
A licence under section 129(1) of the Act is granted: ‘for the purpose of enabling a person to acquire practical experience in giving instruction in driving motor cars with a view to undergoing such part of the examination... as consists of a practical test of ability and fitness to instruct.’
In order to qualify as an Approved Driving Instructor, applicants must pass the Qualifying Examination. This comprises: the written examination (‘Part 1’); the driving ability and fitness test (‘Part 2’); and the instructional ability and fitness test (‘Part 3’).
Three attempts are permitted at each part. The whole examination must be completed within 2 years of passing Part 1, failing which the whole examination has to be retaken.
If a candidate has passed Part 2, they may be granted a trainee licence. The grant of a trainee licence enables applicants to provide instruction for payment before they are qualified. It is possible to qualify as an Approved Driving Instructor without having held a trainee licence.
The powers of the Tribunal in determining this appeal are set out in s.131 of the Act. The Tribunal may make such order as it thinks fit.
When making its Decision, the Tribunal stands in the shoes of the Registrar and takes a fresh decision on the evidence available to it, giving appropriate weight to the Registrar’s decision as the person tasked by Parliament with making such decisions.
The burden of proof in satisfying the Tribunal that the Registrar’s decision was wrong rests with the Appellant.
Factual Background to the Appeal
The Appellant passed Part 1 of the Qualifying Examination on 1 December 2022. He passed Part 2 on 21 April 2023.
He took and failed Part 3 on 28 May 2024. A further Part 3 test was booked on 8 August 2024 but was cancelled by the Appellant.
Two trainee licenses have been granted to the Appellant, which were valid from 10 July 2023 to 9 July 2024.
On 26 June 2024 the Appellant applied for a third trainee licence.
On 2 July 2024 the Appellant was informed that the Registrar was considering refusing the application and invited to make representations.
In response, on 6 July 2024, the Appellant stated that he had lost a month’s training and practice time due to a road traffic accident in April 2024 and that there was a lack of available tests.
The application was refused on 8 August 2024.
The reasons for the Registrar’s decision, in summary, were that:
that the Appellant had provided no evidence of lost training time or lack of pupils;
the Appellant had had the benefit of two training licenses for twelve months;
the Appellant had cited lack of test availability but cancelled one  himself;
that the Appellant had already had a sufficient amount of time to gain experience to assist in passing Part 3 of the Qualifying Examination and that it was not the intention of Parliament that candidates should be issued with trainee licences for as long as it takes them to pass the examination, and that the trainee licence system must not be used as an alternative to registration as a fully qualified Approved Driving Instructor.
Appeal to the Tribunal
The grounds of appeal are, in summary:
the Appellant has had difficulty getting a Part 3 test date, his first booking being made in November 2023 for a first available date in May 2024;
a test was booked (at the time the appeal was filed) on 8 August 2024, which he was confident of passing;
the Appellant was in a serious accident on 2 April 2024 which prevented him from working for a month; it also set him back mentally, meaning that he had to build up his confidence.
The Registrar, in his response, states:
the purpose of the provisions governing the issue of licences is to afford applicants the opportunity of giving instruction to members of the public whilst endeavouring to achieve registration. The system of issuing licences is not and must not be allowed to become an alternative to the system of registration;
the licence granted to applicants is not to enable the instructor to teach for however long it takes to pass the examinations, but to allow up to six months experience of instruction. This provides a very reasonable period in which to reach the qualifying standard in the examination and in particular, to obtain any necessary practical experience in tuition. The Appellant has already had two trainee licences which cover a period of 12 months. Moreover, by virtue of the Appellant having applied for a third licence before the expiry date of the second, that licence has remained in force to the present time and will allow him to continue to give paid instruction until determination of the appeal;
since passing his driving ability test the Appellant has failed the instructional ability test once and cancelled one more such test booked for 08 August 2024. Despite ample time and opportunity the Appellant has not been able to reach the required standard for qualification as an Approved Driving Instructor;
the refusal of a third licence does not bar the Appellant from attempting the instructional ability test of the Register examinations. He does not need to hold a licence for that purpose, nor is it essential for him to give professional tuition under licence in order to obtain further training. The Appellant could attend a training course, or study and practice with an Approved Driving Instructor or give tuition on his own (provided that he does not receive payment of any kind for this). These alternatives are used by some trainees who acquire registration without obtaining any licences at all;
it should be noted [as at 5 September 2024] that the Appellant has not yet booked his second attempt at the instructional ability test.
Evidence
I read and took account of a bundle of documents.
Discussion and Conclusions
I may overturn the decision of the Registrar if I am of the opinion that it was wrong. The burden is on the Appellant to show this.
I note that the Appellant has had the benefit of a trainee licence since 10 July 2023, which has been extended once by the Registrar and again, by virtue of this application, up to today’s date. This has given him a total period of almost 18 months in which to prepare for his Part 3 test, notwithstanding the enforced time off work and of which I have seen evidence.
I accept that the Appellant was in a road traffic collision in April 2024 and I accept that it necessitated the time off work and caused the loss of confidence he described in his appeal form.
However, at that time the Appellant had already held a trainee license for over a year.
I note that the Appellant, in his appeal form, was confident of passing the Part 3 test he had booked in August 2024 but subsequently he cancelled that date. I do not know why.
The Appellant can continue to study and practice and is able to continue to gain experience and take the test without a trainee licence.
The trainee license is not a substitute for taking and passing the test. It is not the purpose of trainee licences to keep renewing them until all attempts at passing Part 3 have been taken.
Having weighed all matters in the balance, the Appellant has not persuaded me that the Registrar’s decision was wrong. In all the circumstances, I agree with the Registrar’s decision and the appeal is dismissed.

REVENUE AND CUSTOMS
Appellants
and
SONDER EUROPE LIMITED
Respondent
Representation:
For the Appellants: Andrew Macnab, Counsel instructed by the General Counsel and Solicitor for His Majesty’s Revenue and Customs
For the Respondent: Jonathan Bremner KC, Counsel instructed by KPMG LLP
DECISION
Introduction
This is an appeal by the Commissioners for His Majesty’s Revenue and Customs (“HMRC”) against a decision of the First-tier Tribunal Tax Chamber (“the FTT”) released on 5 July 2023 (“the Decision”). The FTT held that supplies of accommodation made by the Respondent (“Sonder”) fell within the scope of the Tour Operators’ Margin Scheme (“the TOMS”) for the purposes of Value Added Tax (“VAT”).
We are concerned with supplies made by Sonder in VAT periods 10/17, 01/18 and 04/18. The supplies in question were supplies of accommodation in the UK to corporate and leisure travellers. Sonder leased self-contained apartments from third party landlords for periods between two and ten years. It then granted licenses to travellers to occupy the apartments for periods ranging from a single night up to a month. During the relevant VAT periods the average stay in an apartment by a traveller was five nights.
Sonder accounted for VAT pursuant to the TOMS on its margin, that is the difference between the total amount, exclusive of VAT, payable by the traveller and the cost to Sonder payable to the third party landlords. HMRC contended that Sonder’s supplies did not fall within the TOMS and Sonder ought to have accounted for VAT at the standard rate on the value of supplies to travellers. HMRC assessed Sonder to VAT in the sum of £252,229 for the relevant VAT periods.
The FTT held that the TOMS did apply to Sonder’s supplies of accommodation and allowed its appeal.
Legislative Framework
It is convenient to start by setting out the EU provisions which establish a special scheme for travel agents and tour operators. Save where the context otherwise requires, we shall refer to such businesses as “travel agents”. The provisions are contained in Articles 306 to 310 Council Directive 2006/112/EC (the Principal VAT Directive or “PVD”). The EU provisions were implemented by section 53 Value Added Tax Act 1994 (“VATA 1994”) and the Value Added Tax (Tour Operators) Order 1987 (“the TOMS Order”). It is common ground that the TOMS Order must be construed consistently with the PVD, although how the TOMS Order is to be construed is very much in issue. It is also common ground that following the UK’s exit from the EU, EU law continues to apply to all the periods under appeal because they pre-date the implementation period completion day.
EU Law
Article 26 of Council Directive 77/388/EEC (“the Sixth VAT Directive”) introduced the EU special scheme for travel agents. The Sixth VAT Directive was repealed and replaced by the PVD, which re-enacted Article 26 in Articles 306 to 310. The material provisions for the purposes of this appeal are as follows:
Article 306
Member States shall apply a special VAT scheme, in accordance with this Chapter, to transactions carried out by travel agents who deal with customers in their own name and use supplies of goods or services provided by other taxable persons, in the provision of travel facilities. This special scheme shall not apply to travel agents where they act solely as intermediaries and to whom point (c) of the first paragraph of Article 79 applies for the purposes of calculating the taxable amount.
For the purposes of this Chapter, tour operators shall be regarded as travel agents.
Article 307
Transactions made, in accordance with the conditions laid down in Article 306, by the travel agent in respect of a journey shall be regarded as a single service supplied by the travel agent to the traveller.
The single service shall be taxable in the Member State in which the travel agent has established his business or has a fixed establishment from which the travel agent has carried out the supply of services.
Article 308
The taxable amount and the price exclusive of VAT, within the meaning of point (8) of Article 226, in respect of the single service provided by the travel agent shall be the travel agent’s margin, that is to say, the difference between the total amount, exclusive of VAT, to be paid by the traveller and the actual cost to the travel agent of supplies of goods or services provided by other taxable persons, where those transactions are for the direct benefit of the traveller.
…
Article 310
VAT charged to the travel agent by other taxable persons in respect of transactions which are referred to in Article 307 and which are for the direct benefit of the traveller shall not be deductible or refundable in any Member State.
The FTT summarised the EU special scheme at [8] as follows:
It follows from the PVD that the EU special scheme applies to:
transactions carried out by travel agents or tour operators;
dealing with customers in their own name;
using supplies of goods or services provided by other taxable persons;
in the provision of travel facilities; and
where those supplies are for the direct benefit of the traveller.
The FTT further noted at [9] that the EU special scheme does not apply to travel agents where they act solely as intermediaries and are merely reimbursed expenditure incurred in the name of and on behalf of a customer.
The question of whether the TOMS is only engaged where the supplies received by Sonder had to be supplied for “the direct benefit of the traveller” and if so whether they were so supplied lies at the heart of this appeal.
UK Legislation
Section 53(1) VATA 1994 provided at the material times:
53 Tour operators
The Treasury may by order modify the application of this Act in relation to supplies of goods or services by tour operators or in relation to such of those supplies as may be determined by or under the order.
…
In this section ‘tour operator’ includes a travel agent acting as principal and any other person providing for the benefit of travellers services of any kind commonly provided by tour operators or travel agents.
The TOMS Order was introduced with effect from 1 April 1988. Articles 2 and 3 define the supplies which fall within the scope of the TOMS:
2 Supplies to which this Order applies
This Order shall apply to any supply of goods or services by a tour operator where the supply is for the benefit of travellers.
3 Meaning of ‘designated travel service’
Subject to paragraphs (2) and (4) of this article, a ‘designated travel service’ is a supply of goods or services –
acquired for the purposes of his business; and
supplied for the benefit of a traveller without material alteration or further processing;
by a tour operator in a member State of the European Union in which he has established his business or has a fixed establishment.
The supply of one or more designated travel services, as part of a single transaction, shall be treated as a single supply of services.
…
The supply of goods and services of such description as the Commissioners of Customs and Excise may specify shall be deemed not to be designated travel services.
For present purposes, we are concerned with the question of whether the supplies received by Sonder from third party landlords were supplied onwards for the benefit of travellers “without material alteration or further processing” within the meaning of Article 3(1)(b).
Article 7 of the TOMS Order makes provision for the VAT on a supply falling within it to be taxed by reference to the margin:
Subject to articles 8, 9 and 9A of this Order, the value of a designated travel service shall be determined by reference to the difference between sums paid or payable to and sums paid or payable by the tour operator in respect of that service, calculated in such manner as the Commissioners of Customs and Excise shall specify.
It is also important to note that the supply of an interest in land is an exempt supply by virtue of Schedule 9 Group 1 Item 1 VATA 1994, although a supply of hotel accommodation or similar is excluded from exemption and is therefore a standard rated supply:
Item 1 The grant of any interest in or right over land or of any licence to occupy land, or, in relation to land in Scotland, any personal right to call for or be granted any such interest or right, other than –
…
the provision in an hotel, inn, boarding house or similar establishment of sleeping accommodation or of accommodation in rooms which are provided in conjunction with sleeping accommodation or for the purpose of a supply of catering;
the grant of any interest in, right over or licence to occupy holiday accommodation;
The FTT’s findings of fact
There was no real issue as to the primary facts before the FTT. It made findings of fact at [26] – [42] of the Decision and we summarise the FTT’s findings in the following paragraphs.
Sonder commenced its UK operations in 2017. During the relevant VAT periods it rented 40 individual apartments from third party landlords. The leases required Sonder to use the apartments only as serviced apartments for residential occupation. The evidence before the FTT was that leases between Sonder and the landlords were for terms between two and ten years.  The landlords were not hoteliers and the case was argued on the basis that the supply bought in by Sonder was not the grant of any interest in, right over or licence to occupy holiday accommodation.
Approximately 37.5% of the apartments which Sonder rented were furnished and described as “ready to go”. The remaining 62.5% were unfurnished and could not be used in Sonder’s business until Sonder had furnished them to its specification. Furnishings provided by Sonder included beds, sofas, armchairs, coffee and side tables, chairs, bookcases and lamps as well as smaller decorative items such as rugs, vases and wall art and basic kitchen utensils. White goods were always provided by the landlords.
The FTT found at [30] and [31]:
Anything Sonder did to the apartments, whether furnished or unfurnished, was only ever purely superficial and cosmetic in nature. Sonder never made any changes which would have altered the fabric or structure of the apartment or building, such as moving a wall or door or changing windows. The agreements with the landlords typically prohibited Sonder from making any alterations or additions to the property…
In a small number of cases, in respect of unfurnished accommodation, Sonder arranged for an accent wall to be painted or for other minor decorating to be done. However, this was not typical and it was more common for any work of that nature to be undertaken by the landlord prior to Sonder entering into the agreement with the landlord.
The agreements between Sonder and the landlords were ‘internal repairing insuring’ leases. Sonder was responsible for keeping the apartments and any furnishings provided by the landlord as they were when the lease was entered into. If any damage was caused to an apartment such as a broken TV or a scratch on the wall, it would be Sonder’s responsibility to replace the TV and repair the damage to the wall. The apartments had to be delivered up in their original condition at the end of the lease. Any walls that had been painted had to be repainted and items added had to be removed.
Between October 2017 and May 2018 Sonder paid rent to landlords of approximately £1.5m. In the same period it spent approximately £20,000 on maintenance and repairs. There was no finding on how much Sonder spent on furnishing the unfurnished apartments.
Sonder used the apartments to provide accommodation to business and leisure travellers, described generally as “holiday accommodation”. A traveller would book online with Sonder and receive an access code to access the apartment. The traveller could not book directly with the landlord. Sonder had no staff on site, but would use a third party housekeeping company to provide cleaning and housekeeping services. Apartments were not normally cleaned during a stay, unless requested and paid for by the traveller.
Apartments were self-contained with the normal furnishings and features of an apartment. Apartments had kitchens with cooking utensils. Food and beverages were not provided apart from tea and coffee in some rooms.
Sonder had a “Hospitality Team” to support guests who had any questions, or who required additional items such as fresh towels or toiletries. Some apartments would have a self-service consumables cabinet. Otherwise, such items would be delivered by Sonder staff.
At the end of a stay, there was no check-out procedure as such. The traveller would simply leave the apartment.
The FTT’s Decision
The FTT referred to various authorities in the European Court of Justice and the Court of Justice of the European Union (both referred to as “the CJEU”) as to the scope of the special scheme for travel agents in the PVD. We consider these authorities in due course. The FTT then went on to consider the submissions of the parties and discussed its findings in relation to the issues at [61] – [80].
The FTT did not accept HMRC’s submission that to fall within the TOMS Order, a trader had to purchase holiday or hotel accommodation which it then used to make onward supplies of such accommodation to travellers. It held there was no such requirement in the PVD or the TOMS Order. Nor was there any requirement that the bought-in supplies, as they are described in some of the authorities, must be identical to the supplies made to travellers. The TOMS Order simply requires that a travel agent acquires the right to use an apartment for the purposes of its business and supplies it for the benefit of a traveller without material alteration or further processing. These findings appear at [61] to [65] of the Decision:
In essence, HMRC’s case was that, to come within TOMS, a trader must have bought in holiday or hotel accommodation which the trader then uses to make onward supplies of such accommodation to travellers. Sonder leased the apartments from the landlords for a term of years with no stipulation that they must be used for the provision of accommodation for travellers. Sonder used the leased apartments to make supplies of short term accommodation to travellers. Mr Macnab’s submission was that those supplies did not fall within the TOMS because they were supplies made from Sonder’s own resources.
I do not accept Mr Macnab’s submission that in order for a supply of holiday accommodation to fall within the TOMS, the tour operator must have bought in holiday accommodation. I do not find that requirement in the EU special scheme as set out in the PVD or in the TOMS Order. Nor, in my view, can it be inferred. Article 306 of the PVD simply refers to “supplies of goods or services provided by other taxable persons [which are used] in the provision of travel facilities”. The TOMS Order states that goods or services acquired for the purposes of the tour operator’s business and provided for the benefit of a traveller without material alteration or further processing are within the scope of the TOMS. In neither case is there any further requirement that the bought-in supplies must be identical to the supplies provided by the tour operator to the traveller.
Although it may be that the bungalows in Van Ginkel were holiday accommodation or second homes rather than ordinary residential property used for holidays, that fact is not mentioned in the judgment. The ECJ referred to “holiday accommodation” in [24] and [27] but that only referred to what was provided by the travel agent and not by the landlords. In Alpenchalets, the Advocate General referred to the properties as “houses” and the CJEU used  the term “residences”. The only mention of “holiday accommodation” and “holiday rentals” again referred to the supplies made by Alpenchalets Resorts GmbH and not the supplies by the owners. I conclude that whether the bought-in accommodation was or was not “holiday accommodation” was not a factor in the ECJ’s reasoning in Van Ginkel and Alpenchalets.
In my view, the nature or characteristics for VAT purposes of the goods and services supplied by third parties to the tour operators do not determine whether onward supplies fall within the TOMS. The purpose to which the apartments had been put by the landlords was irrelevant to the VAT treatment of the onward supply of those apartments by Sonder.
In order to be a designated travel service and come within the TOMS, the TOMS Order only requires that the right to use the apartments was acquired by a tour operator for the purposes of its business before being supplied for the benefit of a traveller without material alteration or further processing.
The FTT found that Sonder was a tour operator or travel agent for the purposes of the TOMS Order. It provided accommodation to travellers in self-contained apartments which is a type of service commonly provided by tour operators or travel agents. These findings appear at [66] and [67] of the Decision:
The first question is whether Sonder was a tour operator for the purposes of the TOMS. It is clear from Madgett and Baldwin and ISt that the terms ‘travel agent’ and ‘tour operator’ are to be interpreted broadly. Any business that provides services which are the same as or comparable to those provided by travel agents or tour operators within the normal meaning of those terms is itself a travel agent or tour operator for the purposes of the EU special scheme. That is reflected in section 53(3) VATA.
The apartments were used by Sonder as serviced apartments for the residential occupation of travellers. There was no suggestion that the apartments were used as permanent or long term accommodation and, during the relevant period, the average length of stay was only five nights. Sonder used the apartments to provide temporary accommodation for persons who did not reside in them as their homes. I conclude that such persons were travellers and the apartments were, therefore, travel facilities (in the terms of Article 306 PVD) and for the benefit of travellers (as required by section 53(3) VATA). I also find that the provision of accommodation in self-contained apartments is the type of service that was commonly provided by tour operators or travel agents. Indeed, I did not understand Mr Macnab to contend otherwise. I conclude that Sonder was a tour operator for the purposes of the TOMS during the relevant period.
When the FTT came to consider the test to be applied to Sonder’s services it did so firstly by reference to Sonder’s supplies generally, and then in relation to Sonder’s supplies of unfurnished accommodation where Sonder furnished the apartments before making the onward supply to travellers. In relation to the supplies generally, the FTT held at [72] – [76] that there was no material alteration or further processing of the third party supplies. In relation to the specific supplies of unfurnished apartments, it also held at [77] that there was no material alteration or further processing.
The FTT held that the fact Sonder received an exempt supply of land and made a standard rated supply of holiday accommodation did not mean that it had not made an onward supply of an apartment for the purposes of the TOMS Order. Further, a change from leasing the apartments as accommodation for a term of years to supplying them as holiday accommodation did not amount to a material alteration or further processing for the purposes of the TOMS Order:
I have already concluded in [62] to [65] that the fact that the terms on which the landlords let the apartments to Sonder and Sonder let them to the travellers and that the VAT treatment of their respective supplies were different did not mean that Sonder had not made onward supplies of the apartments for the purposes of the TOMS. For similar reasons, I consider that a change from letting the apartments for a term of years as accommodation, to letting them as, as Sonder did, for holiday accommodation did not amount to material alteration or further processing.
In my view, the object of the alteration or processing must be the thing supplied, ie the apartment, not the characterisation of the supply for VAT purposes. In ISt, the German government submitted that the EU special scheme should not apply to exempt services of language training and education which formed part of the programmes offered. The CJEU rejected this argument in [39] as follows:
‘There is nothing to suggest that the application of [the EU special scheme] is dependent on such a condition. It should be noted that in respect of operations involving bought-in supplies and services for which traders should be taxed under that article, the only relevant criterion is whether or not the travel service is ancillary.’
The CJEU’s response in ISt shows that the EU special scheme still applies even where an exempt supply to a tour operator changes to a supply chargeable to VAT, albeit on the margin, when supplied by the tour operator as part of travel facilities. It follows that the correct question in this case is whether the apartments themselves, and not the tax status of their supplies, were materially altered or further processed before they were supplied by Sonder to the travellers.
The FTT considered that the term “material alteration or further processing” refers to more than minor changes or processes which do not affect the fundamental character of the particular goods or services. The alteration and processing must change the goods or services so that what is supplied cannot be described in the same terms as the items acquired. Any changes to the apartments, including furnishing the unfurnished apartments, were “cosmetic or decorative” and could easily be reversed. They could not be described as material and did not amount to processing of the apartment:
It seems to me to be clear from the nature of the TOMS that “material alteration or further processing” must refer to more than minor changes or processes which do not affect the fundamental character of the particular goods or services. It would be absurd as well as impracticable if any minor change or processing excluded a bought-in supply from the TOMS. In order to be excluded from the TOMS, I consider that the alteration and processing must change the goods or services supplied so that what is supplied by the tour operator cannot be described in the same terms as the items acquired.
I do not consider that it matters whether the apartments were furnished or unfurnished when they were acquired by Sonder. In both cases, Sonder supplied the apartments to the travellers without changing their structure. The evidence shows that any changes that Sonder made to the apartments were cosmetic or decorative, such as painting a wall or providing furnishings and decorative items. In the case of the unfurnished apartments, Sonder additionally acquired the furnishings which were needed to enable it to provide the apartment to the travellers. The nature of the changes that were made were such as they could be reversed simply by removing the items of furniture or re-painting a wall. In my view, such changes cannot be described as material and do not amount to processing of the apartment.
The FTT noted that the PVD does not refer to altering or processing the goods or services being supplied. However, given the FTT’s conclusion at [76] and [77] it decided at [78] that it was not necessary to consider whether the exclusion of supplies where the goods or services had been materially altered or further processed was consistent with the PVD:
The UK notion of alteration and further processing does not appear in Directive. Nowhere in ECJ case law does it say that bought-in supplies that are altered or subject to processing must be excluded from the EU special scheme. As I have concluded that furnishing an apartment did not constitute a material alteration to that apartment or further processing of it, I do not need to consider whether the exclusion from the TOMS of goods or services which have been materially altered or processed by the tour operator is consistent with the EU special scheme in the PVD.
In conclusion, the FTT held that Sonder’s supplies were designated travel services within the TOMS Order.
The grounds of appeal
HMRC has three grounds of appeal, for which the FTT granted permission to appeal. The grounds of appeal may be summarised as follows:
The FTT erred in law at [62] – [65] and [72] – [76] in finding that Sonder’s supplies to customers were designated travel services. The FTT should have held that Sonder’s supply to its customers were not supplied “without material alteration or further processing” and/or that the supplies were not “for the direct benefit” of its customers.
Further or alternatively, the FTT erred in law in finding at [76] and [77] that Sonder’s supplies of unfurnished apartments were designated travel services.
Further or alternatively, the FTT erred in law in failing to take into account that Sonder carried out significant and meaningful steps to perform obligations to its customers which  amounted to a material alteration to the supply. Namely, paying utilities and council tax, and undertaking responsibility for the upkeep of the apartments.
At this stage we note that it was Sonder’s uncontradicted position in its written argument that it was common ground that it was a tour operator within section 53(3) VATA 1994 because Sonder provided the benefit of serviced accommodation which was of a kind commonly provided by tour operators. Having said that, we note for completeness that when this decision was circulated to the parties for clerical errors and corrections, HMRC stated that this was not in fact common ground. Their position was that Sonder could be a tour operator if it bought in supplies of travel accommodation for the direct benefit of its traveller customers which it resold in its own name to its customers. Whilst Sonder objected to this paragraph being amended, nothing appears to turn on HMRC’s apparent change of position for the purposes of our Decision. It is also common ground that Sonder acquired the leases from landlords for the purposes of its business, so Article 3(1)(a) of the TOMS Order is satisfied.
There is no dispute that the landlords were taxable persons. This is not a requirement in the TOMS Order but it is a requirement of Article 306 PVD. A taxable person for the purposes of the PVD is simply a person who carries out any economic activity (see Article 9 PVD). There is no requirement for the purposes of the PVD that a taxable person should be making taxable supplies or be registered for VAT.
The overarching issue is whether Sonder satisfied Article 3(1)(b) of the TOMS Order which provides that supplies will only be “designated travel services” where they are supplied “for the benefit of a traveller without material alteration or further processing”.
We shall consider the grounds of appeal in the same order. We are grateful to both parties for their clear and succinct written and oral submissions.
Ground 1
Mr Macnab for HMRC says that the FTT erred in law in finding that Sonder’s supplies were designated travel services falling within the TOMS Order. A designated travel service for the purposes of the TOMS Order is a supply acquired by a travel agent for the purposes of its business which is supplied onward for the benefit of a traveller without material alteration or further processing. HMRC say that the TOMS Order is not engaged because the bought-in supply of an interest in land from the landlords was not a transaction for the “direct benefit of the traveller” and therefore was not a designated travel service. It was an exempt supply of land and not a taxable supply of holiday accommodation.
In making that submission, HMRC accepted that in determining whether Sonder’s supplies were designated travel services within the meaning of Article 3(1) of the TOMS Order, the FTT was required to construe the TOMS Order itself, and that there is no reference in the TOMS Order to any requirement that the bought-in supply should be for the “direct benefit of the traveller”. That term does however appear in Articles 308 and 310 of the PVD and Mr Macnab submitted that a supply “for the benefit of a traveller without material alteration or further processing” was simply another way of describing a supply for the “direct benefit of the traveller”.
Mr Bremner KC on behalf of Sonder submitted that there is no requirement in the TOMS Order that the supply be for the direct benefit of the traveller. The only requirement is that there is no material alteration or further processing of the supply acquired from the landlord. He submitted that Sonder acquired a right to occupy the apartments for the purposes of its business and supplied a right to occupy the apartments for the benefit of travellers. There was no material alteration or further processing and the supply was therefore a designated travel service within the TOMS Order. The FTT applied the correct test and made an evaluative judgment that there was no material alteration or further processing. We should not interfere with the FTT’s evaluative judgment. Sonder secured the right to use the apartments and supplied the right to use the apartments. He submitted that HMRC were confusing the legal mechanism by which the rights were acquired and supplied, namely a lease and a short licence, with what was obtained and supplied, namely a right to use.
Mr Bremner further submitted that neither the PVD nor the TOMS Order requires the travel agent to acquire a supply of holiday accommodation which is then supplied to customers. The only question is whether Sonder is using supplies made to it in the provision of travel facilities. HMRC are seeking to re-write the statutory test to include such a requirement.
It is common ground that the TOMS Order was intended to implement what are now Articles 306 – 310 PVD. It is also common ground that we must construe the TOMS Order in so far as possible to conform with the requirements of the PVD. It is therefore helpful to consider the objectives of the special scheme set out in the PVD. Those objectives were conveniently described in a Commission Staff Working Document published by the European Commission on 17 February 2021.
The Sixth VAT Directive in 1977 introduced a special scheme for travel agents and tour operators due to the special nature of that industry. The services offered by such businesses usually consist of a package of services, in particular transport and accommodation acquired from third parties. Those third parties will often be based in different EU member states. The packages are then sold by travel agents or tour operators, acting in their own name, by way of a single supply to their customers. The complexity and location of the services acquired mean that it would be administratively difficult to apply the normal VAT rules on place of supply, taxable amount and deduction of input tax.
The special scheme was therefore intended to pursue two main objectives:
To simplify the normal VAT rules that would otherwise apply so that travel agents do not have to register for VAT in each member state where services are acquired, and
To ensure that VAT revenue goes to the member state in which final consumption of each individual component of the single supply takes place.
Case law of the CJEU has confirmed that the special scheme does not only apply where the services acquired comprise multiple services which are packaged together, or only where there is a cross-border element as between the services acquired and the services supplied by the travel agent. Hence, in Van Ginkel Waddinxveen BV and others v Inspecteur der Omzetbelasting, Utrecht Case C-163/91 [1996] STC 825 the CJEU held that the scheme applied to a travel agent providing only accommodation to customers which had been supplied by third parties. In Customs and Excise Commissioners v Madgett and Baldwin C-308/96 and C-94/9 [1998] STC 1189, the Court of Justice held that the scheme applied to a travel agent acquiring and supplying services within a single member state. We refer to both these authorities in more detail below.
It is also worth noting that the special scheme and the TOMS Order are intended in principle to be tax neutral. Hence, over the chain of supplies the VAT accounted for by the travel agent and third parties making supplies to the travel agent will be the same. Ultimately, the burden of VAT will fall upon the purchaser of the package (see Advocate General Sharpston in European Commission v Spain Case C-189/11 at [7] and [8]). Having said that, if the purchaser of the travel facilities is a VAT registered business, it will bear the burden of VAT on the travel agent’s margin rather than the final consumer because the purchaser will not be entitled to reclaim input tax where the travel agent accounts for VAT pursuant to the TOMS Order.
Both parties sought to draw support for their submissions as to the correct test to be applied in construing Article 3(1)(b) TOMS Order from a number of authoritative decisions of the CJEU. In our judgment, those decisions do not support the case of either party. It appears that the issue raised in this appeal is a novel issue which has not previously been considered by the CJEU or in any domestic UK authority to which our attention has been drawn.
The first decision of the CJEU is Van Ginkel, referred to above. In that case the taxpayer offered ‘motoring holidays’ in the Netherlands to its customers. Customers used their own vehicles and the taxpayer supplied travel accommodation. Customers were accommodated in bungalows, most of which were owned by third parties.
The CJEU held at [27] that the fact that transport was not arranged for the traveller by the travel agent and that the traveller was merely provided with accommodation did not exclude the supplies from the special scheme, at that time contained in Article 26 Sixth VAT Directive:
… art 26 of the Sixth Directive must be interpreted as meaning that the fact that transport of the traveller is not arranged by a travel agent or a tour operator and that the latter merely provides the traveller with holiday accommodation is not such as to exclude the services provided by such undertakings from the field of application of art 26.
Mr Macnab says that it was implicit in the case that what was bought-in by the travel agent was holiday accommodation. It is said to be implicit because of how the Court described the supplies, for example at [3] where it is said that the taxpayer arranged “the travel accommodation” and at [9] where it is said that the taxpayer “lets holiday dwellings”.
We consider that Mr Macnab is reading too much into such references. The judgment does not identify the nature of the bought-in supply and in our view it is authority only for the proposition at [27] of the Court’s judgment.
Similarly, Mr Bremner submitted that the present case was indistinguishable on its facts from Van Ginkel. We do not consider that is the case, given that the judgment in Van Ginkel does not describe the nature of the supplies which the taxpayer bought-in.
The next decision of the CJEU is Alpenchalets Resorts GmbH v Finanzamt München Abteilung Körperschaften Case C‑552/17. In that case, the taxpayer rented residences in Germany, Austria, and Italy from their owners which it then let to individual customers as holiday rentals. The circumstances are described at [12]:
In the course of 2011, Alpenchalets rented residences in Germany, Austria, and Italy from their owners and let them, subsequently, in its own name, to individual customers as holiday rentals. In addition to accommodation, the services included the cleaning of the accommodation and, in some cases, a laundry and ‘bread roll’ service.
The CJEU identified the question at [19]:
By its first question, the referring court asks, in essence, whether Articles 306 to 310 of the VAT Directive must be interpreted as meaning that the mere supply by a travel agent of holiday accommodation rented from other taxable persons or such a supply of a holiday residence combined with the supply of additional ancillary services is covered by the special VAT scheme for travel agents.
The Court said as follows in answer to that question:
It must, first, be observed that, pursuant to Article 306 of the VAT Directive, that special scheme applies only where the travel agent uses for the organisation of the journey supplies of goods and services bought in from other taxable persons (see, to that effect, judgment of 25 October 2012, Kozak, C‑557/11, EU:C:2012:672, paragraphs 18 and 21).
21 The request for a preliminary ruling does not include any information as to whether or not the owners or operators of properties, who have leased their residences to Alpenchalets, are subject to VAT.
22 Accordingly, the Court can only answer the first question on the assumption that those owners and operators of properties have the status of taxable persons for the purpose of VAT, which is a matter to be determined by the referring court.
23 As is apparent from the wording of Article 306 of the VAT Directive and the case-law of the Court, the special scheme for travel agents applies only where a travel agent uses goods or services supplied by third parties, in the provision of travel, which means that its own services, namely services which have not been bought in from third parties but supplied by the travel agent itself, are not covered by that scheme (see, to that effect, judgment of 25 October 2012, Kozak, C‑557/11, EU:C:2012:672, paragraphs 18, 21, 23 and 27).
…
As regards the application of that special scheme to the supply of a holiday residence bought in from third parties, it must be noted that, as pointed out by the referring court, the Court held, in paragraphs 23 and 24 of the judgment of 12 November 1992, Van Ginkel (C‑163/91,  EU:C:1992:435), that the mere supply of accommodation by a travel agent can be covered by the special scheme. In order to meet the needs of customers, travel agents offer widely different types of holidays and journeys, allowing the traveller to combine, as he wishes, transport, accommodation and any other services which those undertakings may provide. The exclusion from the field of application of Article 306 of the VAT Directive of services supplied by a travel agent on the sole ground that they cover accommodation only would lead to a complicated tax system in which the VAT rules applicable would depend upon the constituents of the services offered to each traveller. Such a tax system would fail to comply with the aims of the Directive.
…
Having regard to the foregoing, the answer to the first question is that Articles 306 to 310 of the VAT Directive must be interpreted as meaning that the mere supply by a travel agent of holiday accommodation rented from other taxable persons or such a supply of a holiday residence combined with the supply of additional ancillary services, regardless of the importance of those ancillary services,
each amount to a single service covered by the special scheme for travel agents.
We can see from these passages that the CJEU was assuming that the owners of the accommodation were taxable persons who were making taxable supplies. Mr Macnab says that it is clear that the travel agent must have bought-in holiday accommodation. That inference arises from references such as that at [25] to “the supply of a holiday residence bought in from third parties”. Although we accept that the language is consistent with Mr Macnab’s submission, we do not consider that we can safely draw that inference. In our view the case is simply authority for the proposition stated at [35]. When the CJEU referred to holiday accommodation being rented from other taxable persons we do not consider that it was describing a condition that what was being bought-in must be holiday accommodation. The existence of such a condition did not fall within the scope of the argument before the Court and was not clearly part of the question referred.
Similarly, Mr Bremner submitted that Sonder’s case is indistinguishable on the facts from Alpenchalets. He submits that the following factors were irrelevant to the analysis of the CJEU: 1) the terms on which the taxpayers rented the accommodation; 2) the nature of the owners’ businesses; 3) whether the customers could have obtained the accommodation directly from the owners; and 4) the VAT treatment of the supply from the owners to the taxpayers.
It is true that the matters identified by Mr Bremner did not form any part of the CJEU’s analysis, but that is because the issue before the CJEU was limited to whether the PVD special scheme was applicable in circumstances where the travel agent made a single supply of travel accommodation which was not part of a package of supplies.  That is not the same as the issue with which this appeal is concerned.
Mr Macnab also relied on the decision of the CJEU in Madgett, referred to above. In that case, a hotel in Devon sold packages to customers from the north of England covering half-board accommodation, transport by coach from various pick-up points and a day coach excursion during their stay. The transport services were obtained from third parties. The taxpayer argued that it was not within the TOMS Order on the ground that it was a hotelier and not a tour operator.
The CJEU held at [20] that the special scheme applied not only to travel agents and tour operators but also to traders effecting identical transactions, such as hoteliers. It also held at [47] that where the package supplied included transactions consisting partly of services supplied by the taxpayer and partly services supplied by other taxable persons, the special scheme applied solely to the services supplied by third parties.
Mr Macnab particularly relied on what was said by the Court at [23] and [34]:
It must therefore be held that the scheme under art 26 of the Sixth Directive applies to traders who organise travel or tour packages in their own name and entrust other taxable persons with the supply of the services generally associated with that kind of activity, even if they are not, formally speaking, travel agents or tour operators.
…
Finally, it should be recalled that the scheme under art 26 constitutes an exception to the normal rules of the Sixth Directive and must be applied only to the extent necessary to achieve its objective.
Mr Macnab submitted that this was authority for a proposition that what is acquired from a third party supplier must be travel services and that the third party supplier must itself be in the business of supplying travel facilities. That was why the Court used the word “entrust” in [23]. He also relied on what is said at [34], that the special scheme in the PVD should be applied “only to the extent necessary to achieve its objective”.
We do not consider that Madgett is authority for Mr Macnab’s proposition. In our view he is reading too much into the word “entrust”. The questions before the CJEU did not involve consideration of the nature of the supply made by the third parties. The Court was not saying that the special scheme was only engaged when a third party was entrusted by a taxable person with making a supply to the traveller. We agree with Mr Bremner that the Court was not addressing the question of whether the special scheme only applied to services obtained from persons who themselves carry on business in the supply of travel services. It was simply describing the circumstances of that case where the taxpayer had entrusted the supply to a third party.
Mr Macnab also referred us to Dyrektor Krajowej Informacji Skarbowej v C. sp. Zoo Case C-108/22 where the taxpayer was a “hotel services consolidator” which purchased and resold holiday accommodation without any other services. The question referred in that case was set out at [19]:
By its question, the referring court asks, in essence, whether Article 306 of the VAT Directive must be interpreted as meaning that the service provided by a taxable person, which consists in purchasing accommodation services from other taxable persons and reselling them to other economic operators, is covered by the special VAT scheme applicable to travel agents, even though those services are not accompanied by ancillary services.
The Court cited Alpenchalets at [28]:
Consequently, the Court has held that Articles 306 to 310 of the VAT Directive must be interpreted as meaning that the mere supply by a travel agent of holiday accommodation rented from other taxable persons or such a supply of a holiday residence combined with the supply of additional ancillary services, regardless of the importance of those ancillary services, each amount to a single service covered by the special scheme for travel agents (judgment of 19 December 2018, Alpenchalets Resort, C-552/17, EU:C:2018:1032, paragraph 35).
The Court answered the question at [30]:
In the light of the foregoing considerations, the answer to the question referred is that Article 306 of the VAT Directive must be interpreted as meaning that the service provided by a taxable person, which consists in purchasing accommodation services from other taxable persons and reselling them to other economic operators, is covered by the special VAT scheme applicable to travel agents, even though those services are not accompanied by ancillary services.
We do not consider that C Sp zoo takes HMRC’s case any further. A hotel services consolidator is certainly within the special scheme, but it does not mean that the special scheme is limited to similar businesses. The Court was simply concerned with the particular facts of the case.
We therefore do not accept that any of the CJEU authorities establish the principle relied on by Mr Macnab to the effect that the special scheme only applies where a travel agent has bought-in travel facilities which are then supplied onwards to travellers. That is not to say that the principle is not correct. It is simply that the issue raised by HMRC is not the subject of previous authority.
It is common ground that the TOMS Order must be construed in so far as possible to conform with the requirements of the PVD. We are required to construe what is meant in the TOMS Order when it refers to a supply “for the benefit of a traveller without material alteration or further processing”. We must do so consistently with the requirements of the PVD in so far as possible.
The thrust of Mr Macnab’s submissions on Ground 1 was that the FTT did not take that approach because it failed to consider whether the exempt supply of land to Sonder by landlords was supplied onwards by Sonder for the direct benefit of the travellers. He submitted that this is a condition for the application of the TOMS Order, construed in conformity with the PVD, and that Sonder’s supplies did not satisfy the condition because it acquired exempt supplies of an interest in land and then supplied taxable travel accommodation to travellers. Essentially, Sonder was not making onward supplies of bought-in services but was making supplies of what some of the authorities refer to as “in-house” services.
In the Decision, the FTT recognised that the PVD contained a requirement that the bought-in services must be for the direct benefit of the traveller, because it identified that requirement in its summary of the PVD at [8]. However, the FTT did not go on to consider whether the requirement in the PVD that a supply be for the direct benefit of the traveller affected how it should construe what amounted to a material alteration or further processing of the bought-in supply for the purposes of the TOMS Order. The question we must consider is whether the FTT correctly construed the TOMS Order in the light of the requirements of the PVD.
The FTT did raise the question of whether the TOMS Order was consistent with the PVD at [16] of the Decision:
It seems to me that section 53 VATA and the TOMS Order are consistent (or can be interpreted conformably) with Articles 306 to 310 PVD save possibly in one respect. That is the requirement in Article 3(1)(b) of the TOMS Order that goods or services acquired for the purposes of the tour operator’s business must be supplied to the traveller without material alteration or further processing. Article 306 PVD merely requires that the supplies of goods or services provided by other taxable persons should be used to provide travel facilities. There is no further requirement that the goods of services should be used in their original state. If necessary then I must decide whether that condition in the TOMS can be interpreted conformably with Article 306 PVD.
Although the FTT recognised that the phrase “without material alteration or further processing” was not language used in the PVD (see [8]), it is notable that in this paragraph the FTT makes no reference to any requirement of the PVD that the supply must be for the direct benefit of the traveller. It states that the PVD merely requires that the third party supplies should be used to provide the travel facilities. Nor does the FTT make any reference to such a requirement in its discussion at [62] – [65] and [76] – [78].
Mr Bremner’s first submission was that, despite the FTT’s summary at [8], the special scheme in the PVD does not include any requirement that the services bought-in must be supplied “for the direct benefit of the traveller”. He argued that the conditions for the special scheme are set out in Article 306 (as is apparent from the language of Article 307) and the only relevant question for present purposes is whether the bought-in supplies were used to make supplies to travellers. If there was a change to the supply that was bought-in then it would not fall within the scheme because it was not being used to make supplies to travellers. It would be the travel agent’s own “in-house” supply.
Mr Bremner submitted that the only references in the PVD to services being for the direct benefit of the traveller are in Articles 308 and 310. Article 308 is simply concerned with computing the costs that are to be taken into account in calculating the margin on which VAT is payable. It is not setting out any further conditions. He said that the purpose of Article 308 in referring to costs for the direct benefit of the traveller is to exclude from the computation costs which are not sufficiently closely related to the supply, such as advertising costs or office costs. Article 310 is simply concerned with ensuring that there is no input tax deduction in respect of supplies falling within the special scheme. Neither Article imposes requirements or conditions for the application of the special scheme.
Mr Bremner also submitted that what the FTT said at [8] of the Decision was consistent with this analysis. The FTT was not setting out the conditions to be satisfied before the special scheme applied. It was simply including within its description of the special scheme how the margin is calculated. If the FTT was in this paragraph setting out conditions for the special scheme to apply, he accepted that it must follow on Sonder’s case that the FTT erred in law in that respect.
We do not accept Mr Bremner’s submissions. We acknowledge that the only references to a transaction being for the direct benefit of the traveller appear in Articles 308 and 310 of the PVD. It is also the case that Article 308 is dealing with the calculation of the margin where the scheme applies and Article 310 blocks the recovery of input tax on bought-in supplies. However, in identifying the circumstances in which the special scheme applies we consider that it is necessary to look at the structure of the special scheme as a whole, as it is set out in Articles 306 to 310.
Article 308 describes the margin as the difference between the total amount exclusive of VAT paid by the traveller and the actual cost to the travel agent of supplies provided by other taxable persons. Mr Bremner contends that the special scheme applies to supplies where the bought-in supplies are used to provide travel facilities. However, where those supplies are not for the direct benefit of the traveller then they are excluded when calculating the margin and can be the subject of an input tax deduction.
We cannot see any reason why the special scheme would create a separate category of supply which falls within the scheme but outside the scheme calculations. In the present case there is only one bought-in supply. On Mr Bremner’s case, if that supply is not for the direct benefit of the traveller then the bought-in supply is not taken into account in computing the margin and there is no restriction on the input tax deduction. Presumably the taxpayer would end up accounting for VAT in the usual way as if the special scheme did not apply. In our view, Mr Bremner’s construction of the PVD would add a layer of complexity which would not be necessary or consistent with the objectives of the special scheme.
Accordingly, for the reasons given above, we are satisfied that construing Articles 306 – 310 as a whole, for supplies to fall within the EU special scheme the supplies bought-in must be supplied for the direct benefit of travellers.
Mr Bremner then submitted that if, as we have found, the PVD contains a requirement that the bought-in supply must be supplied for the direct benefit of travellers, that requirement was not found in the TOMS Order. Further, the TOMS Order could not be construed so as to contain the requirement because that would be to re-write the domestic legislation. He said that the principle set out by the CJEU in Marleasing SA v La Comercial Internacional de Alimentación SA Case C-106/89 (“the Marleasing principle”) could not be applied to give a conforming construction.
The Marleasing principle was set out at [8] of Marleasing:
… in applying national law, whether the provisions in question were adopted before or after the directive, the national court called upon to interpret it is required to do so, as far as possible, in the light of the wording and the purpose of the directive in order to achieve the result pursued by the latter and thereby comply with the third paragraph of Article 189 of the Treaty.
We had only brief submissions from the parties on the Marleasing principle. The principle was summarised by the Court of Appeal in Vodafone 2 v HM Revenue and Customs [2009] EWCA Civ 446 at  [37] and [38] (omitting citations):
We were referred in the parties’ respective written arguments and orally to a number of reported cases on the principles to be observed in looking for a conforming interpretation in either the European Community or Human Rights contexts … The principles which those cases established or illustrated were helpfully summarised by counsel for HMRC in terms from which counsel for V2 did not dissent. Such principles are that:
‘In summary, the obligation on the English courts to construe domestic legislation consistently with Community law obligations is both broad and far-reaching. In particular:
It is not constrained by conventional rules of construction …;
It does not require ambiguity in the legislative language …;
It is not an exercise in semantics or linguistics …;
It permits departure from the strict and literal application of the words which the legislature has elected to use …;
It permits the implication of words necessary to comply with Community law obligations …; and
The precise form of the words to be implied does not matter …’
Counsel for HMRC went on to point out, again without dissent from counsel for V2, that:
‘The only constraints on the broad and far-reaching nature of the interpretative obligation are that:
The meaning should “go with the grain of the legislation” and be “compatible with the underlying thrust of the legislation being construed.” … An interpretation should not be adopted which is inconsistent with a fundamental or cardinal feature of the legislation since this would cross the boundary between interpretation and amendment; … and
The exercise of the interpretative obligation cannot require the courts to make decisions for which they are not equipped or give rise to important practical repercussions which the court is not equipped to evaluate…’
In Test Claimants in the FII Group Litigation v HMRC [2012] UKSC 19, Lord Sumption described Marleasing as authority for a “highly muscular approach” to construing national legislation.
Mr Bremner noted the limitations to the Marleasing principle. We do not propose to embark on a detailed analysis of the authorities, especially when the parties themselves did not do so. We can simply say that we are satisfied that we must endeavour to construe the TOMS Order in a way which conforms with the requirement we have found in the PVD that for the special scheme to apply, the bought-in supply must be supplied for the direct benefit of travellers. In our judgment that is what the TOMS Order meant when it defined a designated travel service as a supply for the benefit of a traveller without material alteration or further processing.
HMRC submitted to the FTT that to fall within the scheme a travel agent supplying holiday accommodation must have bought-in holiday accommodation. The scheme did not apply in circumstances where Sonder had not bought-in holiday accommodation. The FTT rejected that submission at [61] – [65]. It held that there was no requirement for the supplies to be identical, although it does not appear that HMRC’s submissions went that far. The FTT also held that the purpose to which the apartments had been put by the landlords was irrelevant to the VAT treatment of the onward supply by Sonder.  It went on to consider at [70] – [76] HMRC’s submission that a change from leasing the apartments for a term of years to letting them as holiday accommodation amounted to a material alteration or further processing. It applied the same reasoning as it had applied in [62] – [65] to find that there was no material alteration.
As we have said, it is notable that the FTT did not in these paragraphs seek to construe the TOMS Order in light of the direct benefit requirement found in the PVD. Indeed, it was only in relation to the apartments which were acquired unfurnished and then furnished by Sonder in order to make supplies of holiday accommodation that the FTT considered that any issue of conformity arose. However, at [78] the FTT concluded that it did not need to consider whether exclusion from the scheme of supplies which were materially altered or further processed was consistent with the PVD.
We turn now to consider what is meant in the context of the PVD by the requirement that a bought-in supply must be the subject of transactions which are for the direct benefit of the traveller. It seems clear to us that this requirement is reflected in the TOMS Order by the definition of designated travel services as a bought-in supply which is supplied for the benefit of a traveller without material alteration or further processing.
Mr Macnab suggested in his skeleton argument and appears to have argued before the FTT that as a matter of principle where a taxpayer acquires an exempt supply and then makes a taxable supply of travel facilities, the supplies cannot fall within the TOMS Order. That is because there must have been a material alteration in the supply merely by reason of the difference in VAT treatment. He also relied on an argument that on a proper construction of the TOMS Order, HMRC should collect VAT on the total consideration charged by Sonder to its customers. That is essentially an argument that where a trader acquires an exempt supply and then makes a taxable supply of travel facilities, the supplies could not fall within the TOMS Order.
In oral submissions, Mr Macnab accepted that HMRC’s case could not be put that highly. He accepted that exempt supplies could conceivably be included in a package of travel facilities to which TOMS might apply.  Whilst we accept that the TOMS is intended in principle to be tax neutral, we accept Mr Bremner’s submission that in the context of special schemes, perfect VAT neutrality is not attainable.
The more limited submission on which Mr Macnab relied in oral argument was that on the facts of this case there had been a material alteration or further processing in the service supplied because Sonder had acquired interests in land for terms of several years and had supplied short term holiday accommodation to travellers. The supplies could not have been for the direct benefit of travellers because there was no scenario in which a traveller could buy travel accommodation directly from the landlords. The landlords did not supply short term travel accommodation. They were supplying long term interests in land.
The FTT held at [73] and [74] that what is altered or processed must be “the thing supplied, i.e. the apartment”, rather than the characterisation of the supply for VAT purposes. The FTT referred to Finanzamt Heidelberg v ISt internationale Sprach- und Studienreisen GmbH Case C-200/04 [2006] STC 52 in support of that finding. We do not need to consider ISt further, given that Mr Macnab no longer contends that a change in the treatment of the supply from exempt to standard rated will in itself amount to an alteration or processing for these purposes.
The FTT described the test it was applying to the apartments generally at [76] of the Decision. However, in describing what it considered to be the test, the FTT did not have regard to the need to construe the definition of designated travel services in Article 3 of the TOMS Order consistently with the requirements of the PVD, i.e. that the bought-in supply must be supplied for the direct benefit of the traveller. It is convenient to quote [76] again:
It seems to me to be clear from the nature of the TOMS that “material alteration or further processing” must refer to more than minor changes or processes which do not affect the fundamental character of the particular goods or services. It would be absurd as well as impracticable if any minor change or processing excluded a bought-in supply from the TOMS. In order to be excluded from the TOMS, I consider that the alteration and processing must change the goods or services supplied so that what is supplied by the tour operator cannot be described in the same terms as the items acquired.
Mr Macnab did not specifically criticise this general formulation of the test in his submissions, and Mr Bremner said that it offered a helpful proxy for testing what was a material alteration. However, we do not consider that it is necessary or desirable to restate the test in a way that goes beyond the language of the TOMS Order and the PVD. That is because all cases will turn on their own facts. It ought to be sufficient to say that the scheme will apply where there has not been a material alteration or further processing of the bought-in supply such that what is bought-in is not supplied for the direct benefit of the traveller. That is the test the FTT was required to apply.
In the last sentence of [62], the FTT stated that there is no requirement that the bought-in supplies must be identical to the supplies provided by the tour operator to the traveller. That must be right on any view, and HMRC did not suggest otherwise. Mr Macnab did describe “the scenario envisaged” by the TOMS as being one of “back to back supplies” or “re-supplies” by the trader buying in services from third parties which are themselves carrying on business in the travel sector. Again, we do not consider that these alternative descriptions of the test are very helpful. Indeed, they tend to suggest that the bought-in supplies must be identical to the supplies provided to the traveller which is not the case. The terms used by Mr Macnab are therefore apt to confuse the real issue.
Mr Macnab also submitted that the FTT also erred in law at [73] and [74] of the Decision. It described the “thing supplied” as “the apartment” and “the apartments themselves”, when in fact what was supplied was an interest in the apartment. Sonder acquired grants of leases for a term of years to occupy the apartments from the landlords. More particularly, it acquired the right to use the apartments as serviced apartments for the residential occupation of one or more occupiers. This was a materially different service from Sonder’s supply of short term licences to travellers to occupy the apartments as holiday accommodation.
The FTT repeated what we consider to be a misdescription of the service supplied at [77] when it came to consider the unfurnished apartments. It refers to the apartments being supplied “without changing their structure” and notes that any changes “to the apartments” were cosmetic or decorative and did not amount to processing of “the apartment”.
In our view, a focus on alterations to the apartment as the thing supplied, without sufficient regard to alterations in the rights granted in relation to the apartment as the service supplied, was an error of law.  Although the FTT refers at [72] to letting the apartments for a term of years and then letting them as holiday accommodation, and concludes that the change did not amount to a material alteration or further processing, the question of materiality is only analysed by reference to the physical changes made to the apartment itself.  Although the paragraph also cross-refers to [65] where the FTT states that the TOMS Order requires that the “right to use the apartments” was acquired and supplied without material alteration or further processing, there is no explanation as to why that is the case in relation to the totality of the right rather than the later explanation of the alterations made to the physical thing.
Mr Bremner correctly submitted that we should read the Decision as a whole and adopt a realistic analysis of the Decision.  However, looking at the Decision as a whole it appears to us that at [73], [74] and [77] the FTT fell into error in focussing on the apartments themselves as the service supplied and the physical changes to the apartments themselves as the applicable alterations. In particular, at [77] the FTT ought to have been considering whether there was any material alteration or further processing of the term of years in an unfurnished apartment supplied by a landlord in circumstances where what was supplied to the traveller was a short term licence to occupy furnished holiday accommodation. We accept that the nature of the physical changes to the actual apartments are relevant to the test which the FTT ought to have been applying, but the FTT did not compare the alterations to the full bundle of rights and interests supplied to Sonder with those which were supplied by Sonder to travellers in order to assess the materiality of those alterations.
For these reasons, we are satisfied that the FTT fell into error in the test which it applied pursuant to Article 3(1)(b) of the TOMS Order because it failed to have regard to the requirement that the bought-in supply must be for the direct benefit of the traveller, and mischaracterised the precise nature of the supplies to which the test is to be applied. These were material errors of law and we must allow the appeal and set aside the Decision.
Grounds 2 and 3
Grounds 2 and 3 do not therefore arise because we have allowed the appeal on Ground 1. We shall however say a little about Grounds 2 and 3.
HMRC say on Ground 2 that the FTT erred in law in finding that Sonder’s supplies of unfurnished apartments were supplies of designated travel services within the TOMS Order. In particular, it is said that Sonder could not have made onward supplies without furnishing the apartments. The FTT ought to have found that furnishing the apartments constituted a material alteration or further processing of the supply received from the landlords.
HMRC say on Ground 3 that the FTT erred in law in failing to take into account that Sonder carried out significant and meaningful steps to perform its obligations to customers which amounted to a material alteration in the supply. It did so by paying utilities and council tax, and undertaking responsibility for the upkeep of the apartments. It did not merely entrust or sub-contract to a third party the performance of its contractual obligations to customers.
We have found that the FTT applied the wrong test in considering whether the TOMS Order was engaged. In those circumstances, we do not consider it would be helpful to address Grounds 2 and 3 in detail on the hypothetical basis that the FTT had applied the right test. Ground 2 challenges an evaluative judgment of the FTT. In relation to that challenge we must exercise the caution described by the Court of Appeal in re Sprintroom Limited [2019] EWCA Civ 932 at [76] and [77]. In short, if the FTT had applied the right test we would not have been persuaded that we should interfere with an evaluative judgment of the FTT as to whether the supplies of unfurnished apartments had been made without material alteration or further processing.
In relation to Ground 3, we would have adopted the principles described by the Court of Appeal in Volpi v Volpi [2022] EWCA Civ 464. The FTT was not required to set out every aspect of the evidence which it took into account in concluding that there was no material alteration or further processing of the supply, nor was it required to set out every aspect of its reasoning. If the FTT had applied the right test, we would not have been persuaded that the absence of any reference to the matters identified in Ground 3 amounted to an error of law.
Re-making the decision
We have allowed the appeal on Ground 1 and set aside the Decision. HMRC invited us to remake the decision and Mr Bremner did not suggest that the matter should be remitted to the FTT. In the circumstances we consider that it is appropriate for us to re-make the decision.
We have described under Ground 1 the error which the FTT made in considering whether Sonder’s supply to travellers of holiday accommodation involved a material alteration or further processing of the interests in land supplied by landlords for a term of years, because it did not have regard to the question of whether what was bought-in by Sonder was supplied for the direct benefit of the traveller.
Mr Bremner simply submitted that, if there was such a requirement, in light of the FTT’s findings at [62] – [67] and [71] the services acquired by Sonder were clearly for the direct benefit of travellers.
Mr Macnab simply submitted that Sonder acquired interests in land which were supplied for the indirect benefit of all travellers throughout the term of years for which Sonder’s interest subsisted. There was therefore no direct benefit to individual travellers.
The FTT had been referred to a number of decisions of the VAT and Duties Tribunal, but at [75] it stated that it did not find those decisions particularly useful because cases will all turn on their own facts. We were also referred to those cases and have similarly concluded that they do not provide any real assistance. In particular, we do not accept Mr Bremner’s submission that the present case is no different from Independent Coach Travel v HM Customs & Excise [1994] 2 CMLR 257. In that case, the taxpayer made block bookings of ferry crossings and hotel accommodation. The ferry bookings were made for the carriage of a particular number of people travelling by coach. The hotel bookings were made for a particular number of people for stays of varying lengths. The block ferry bookings were then sold to coach travel businesses, with or without appropriate hotel block bookings. On occasion the hotel block bookings would be sold on their own. The term “block booking” therefore referred to blocks of specific individual bookings on specific ferry passages or of specific hotel rooms for specific nights.
One argument on appeal to the VAT Tribunal was whether the taxpayer was a travel agent. The tribunal rejected an argument of the taxpayer that it was not a travel agent because it was not selling to individual travellers. An alternative argument that the taxpayer was not making supplies of designated travel services because the bought-in supply was being further processed was also rejected. In rejecting that argument, the tribunal stated at p265:
In our judgment what ICT does by buying in in bulk supplies of accommodation and ferry crossings and supplying on the same services in quantity, although smaller quantity, as required by its customers does not constitute “further processing” as that expression is to be understood in this legislation. It seems to us that in relation to the supplies of services acquired and supplied on this operation where it is not identical is in fact less extensive than that commonly carried out by tour operators putting together packages and thus supplying travel services which without question are intended to be within the ambit of the Order. To hold that that kind of operation was enough to take services outside its scope would be largely to deprive the Order of any effect.
We have no reason to doubt the correctness of the decision of the tribunal in that case. However, the reasoning does not in our view apply to the facts of the present case. The bought-in supply in that case was a supply of travel facilities from ferry and hotel operators.  In the present case, Sonder was acquiring rights to use and occupy apartments for a term of years.  Sonder was therefore acquiring rights in land from which it could then make its own in-house supplies. That was the economic reality. Sonder was not acquiring specific nights (whether in bulk or individually) which were then supplied on to travellers.
Looking at the facts as a whole, we are satisfied that the service which was supplied by Sonder to the traveller was materially altered from that which was supplied by the third party landlord to Sonder having regard to the direct benefit requirement.  Sonder acquired an interest in land for a term of years. The terms on which it did so were described by the FTT at [28] to [35] of the Decision which we have summarised above. We have taken into account all those terms, and give particular weight to the fact that Sonder entered into internal repairing and insuring leases for a term of years between two and ten years.
The supply which Sonder then made was a short term licence to the traveller to occupy property it had leased as holiday accommodation.  We have summarised the FTT’s findings above, although the FTT does not describe in any detail the terms on which Sonder entered into licences with travellers. The evidence before the FTT included an overview of the “customer journey” which included signing up to Sonder’s terms and conditions. The material terms and conditions simply required payment by the traveller including authorisation to charge a credit card in the event that any damage was caused to the apartment in consideration of the grant of a temporary right of occupation to the traveller.  Overall the way in which the traveller’s licence to occupy is described indicates that there is no reason to think that those terms would be any different to the basis on which a hotel or similar establishment might offer accommodation for the benefit of travellers, which is the basis on which the TOMS Order is said to apply in the first place.  It is a very different bundle of rights from those which were granted to Sonder by the landlords.
The services received by the traveller in consequence of the grant of a licence to occupy are described in [36] to [42] of the FTT’s decision and are markedly different to the services which Sonder itself acquired on entering into the leases with the landlords.  In our view, it is relevant even if not determinative, that these marked differences were themselves reflected in the difference in the VAT treatment of the supply to Sonder and Sonder’s supply to the traveller.  The fact that both Sonder’s rights under its leases with the landlords and a traveller’s rights under its licence from Sonder both gave rights of occupation does not mean that what Sonder acquired was supplied to the traveller without material alteration or further processing such that it was supplied for the direct benefit of the traveller.  In our view the services supplied by the landlord to Sonder were not for the direct benefit of Sonder’s own customers and the services were not supplied by Sonder for the benefit of the traveller without material alteration and further processing.  In short, the services supplied by Sonder to the traveller were its own in-house supplies, which therefore fall outside the ambit of TOMS.
It is not necessary for us to deal with Mr Macnab’s submission that the bought-in supply must in the present context be a supply of travel accommodation. On the present facts we can simply say that the term of years purchased by Sonder was not supplied without material alteration or further processing such that it was for the direct benefit of the traveller.
The position is even clearer in relation to the unfurnished apartments. Sonder acquired an interest in land for a term of years in an unfurnished apartment. It furnished the apartment and then supplied a short term licence to a traveller to occupy as holiday accommodation. What was supplied to the traveller was materially different to what was supplied to Sonder.
Conclusion
For the reasons given above, we allow the appeal on Ground 1 and set aside the decision of the FTT. We re-make the decision so as to dismiss Sonder’s appeal against the assessments.

HHJ Simmonds:
This is an application by HK for the Court to exercise its discretion and permit the making of a conditional order to be made final notwithstanding the passage of 12 months and where the parties had reconciled between conditional order and this application. This has been referred to me as the National Lead Judge on Divorce to give guidance on how the Court should exercise its discretion following the coming into force of the Divorce, Dissolution and Separation Act 2020 and the new Part 7 of the Family Procedure Rules.
The issues that I need to consider are;
Whether a conditional order should be made final where parties have reconciled for a period of 15 months following the granting of the conditional order
If not, whether the conditional order should be rescinded, and the divorce Application be dismissed.
Generally, how the Court should exercise its discretion pursuant to r.7.19(6)(b)
Relevant Factual Background
The parties married in June 2011.   The marriage had broken down by 2022 after a marriage of some 11 years; no children have been born of the marriage.   The applicant issued a sole divorce application on the 2022-May-12 on the ground that the marriage has broken down irretrievably. The matter was uncontested, and the applicant applied for the conditional order on the 2022-September-30, the certificate of entitlement was issued on the 2022-October-7 and the conditional order was granted on the 2022-October-27. the certificate of entitlement issued on the 2022-October-7 and the conditional order granted on the 2022-October-27.
The applicant was then entitled to apply for the final order on or after the 2022-December-9 and the Respondent could have applied on notice three months thereafter.  Neither party did so.
The parties reconciled in March 2023 but separated again in June 2024 returning to sleep in separate rooms.  The reconciliation had lasted some 15 months.
In August 2024 the applicant applied for the conditional order to be made final. The matter came before DDJ Wilkinson on the papers who directed that the applicant should file further information and on the on the 2024-August-23 the applicant’s solicitors emailed the court;
“In response to paragraph (2) of the attached Order made by Deputy District Judge Wilkinson, the Applicant instructs that the parties reconciled in March 2023, but the marriage sadly broke down again around 2 months ago”.
DDJ Wilkinson referred the matter to me on the basis that there was a lack of guidance as to how the court should exercise its discretion when parties had reconciled for a significant period.
I listed the matter for a short case management hearing by TEAMS on the 2024-November-19. The Applicant was represented by her Solicitor and the Respondent appeared in person. The facts as to reconciliation and separation were not in dispute nor that both parties now wished the final order to be made.
I directed the parties to make any written submissions as to how the court should exercise its discretion and said I would hand down a written Judgment. I have received written submissions from Mr Jake R Ellis of Broadway House Chambers dated 2024-December-16 on behalf of the Applicant. I am very grateful to him. I have received nothing from the Respondent.
Legal Principles
The Divorce, Dissolution and Separation Act 2020 (DDSA 2020) came into force on the 2022-April-6 amending the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973; it reformed the law on divorce in various ways; it removed the requirement to prove a fact and what replaced this was a sole ground that the marriage or civil partnership had irretrievably broken down; “no-fault divorce” (s.1 (1))
The court dealing with an application under subsection (1) must take the statement to be conclusive evidence that the marriage has broken down irretrievably.
Applications can be made by one party or the parties jointly.
An Applicant may apply at any time after 20 weeks from the date of issue for a conditional order and;
Rule 7.9
An application under this rule must be accompanied by a statement-
stating whether there have been any changes in the information given in the application.
confirming that, subject to any changes stated, the contents of the application are true; and
where the acknowledgement of service has been signed by the other party to the marriage or civil partnership, confirming that party’s signature on the acknowledgment of service.
The Court then checks the application, certifies (in the vast majority of cases) that the applicant(s) are entitled to a conditional order and directs that the application be listed before a judge for the making of that order on the next available date.
Pursuant to FPR 7.19 the Applicant can then give notice to the court, six weeks after the making of the conditional order, for the order to be made final. On receiving the notice, the Court will make the conditional order final (rule 17.9(4)) if it is satisfied that (subject to paragraphs (5) and (6);
no application for rescission of the conditional order is pending;
no appeal against the making of the conditional order is pending;
no order has been made by the court extending the time for bringing an appeal of the kind mentioned in sub-paragraph (b), or if such an order has been made, that the time so extended has expired;
no application for an order of the kind mentioned in sub-paragraph (c) is pending;
no application to prevent the conditional order being made final is pending;
the provisions of section 10(2) to (4) of the 1973 Act (12) or section 48(2) to (4) of the 2004 Act(13) do not apply or have been complied with;
any order under section 10A(2) of the 1973 Act(14) has been complied with; and
where the conditional order was made on the ground in section 12(1)(g) of, or paragraph 11(1)(e) of Schedule 1 to, the 1973 Act(15), or was made under section 12A(3) of the 1973 Act(16) in a case where section 12(1)(g) of the 1973 Act applies, or the conditional order was made under section 50(1)(d) of the 2004 Act—
there is not pending a reference under section 8(5) of the Gender Recognition Act 2004(17), or an application under section 8(5A) of that Act(18), in respect of the application on which the interim gender recognition certificate to which the application relates was granted;
that interim certificate has not been revoked under section 8(6)(b) of that Act; and
no appeal is pending against an order under section 8(6)(a) of that Act.
Where the notice is received more than 12 months after the making of the conditional order, it must include or be accompanied by an explanation in writing stating why the application has not been made earlier.
Where paragraph (5) applies, the court may—
require the applicant to verify the explanation with a statement of truth; and
make such order on the application as it thinks fit, but where it orders the conditional order to be made final that order is not to take effect until the court is satisfied that none of the matters mentioned in paragraph (4)(a) to (h) applies
Where parties have reconciled after the granting of the conditional order, they can apply for the order to be set aside (recission);
Rule.7.34 Either party to the marriage or civil partnership concerned may apply –
after the conditional order has been made but before it has been made final; or
after a judicial separation order or separation order has been made;
for the recission of the order on the grounds that the parties are reconciled and both consent to the recission
The previous rule in respect of applications for Decree Absolute received after 12 months was r. 7.32 which provided
Where notice is received more than 12 months after the making of the decree nisi or the conditional order, it must be accompanied by an explanation in writing stating-
why the application has not been made earlier;
whether the applicant and respondent have lived together since the decree nisi or the condition order and, if so, between what dates;
if the applicant is female, whether she has given birth to a child since the decree nisi or the conditional order was made and whether it is alleged that the child is or may be a child of the family;
if the respondent is female, whether the applicant has reason to believe that she has given birth to a child since the decree nisi or conditional order was made and whether it is alleged that the child is or maybe a child of the family
Where para (3) applies the court may;
Require the applicant to file an affidavit verifying the explanation and to verify the explanation with a statement of truth, and;
Make such order on the application as it thinks fit, but where it orders the decree nisi to be made absolute or the conditional order to be made final that order is not to take effect until the court is satisfied that none of the matters mentioned in para (2) (a) to (i) applies.
Elements of the previous rule were not continued in the new rule but an explanation of the delay remained together with the court’s discretion.
Having considered r.7.32 I also refer myself to the case law before the DDSA 2020. I take particular note of the dicta of Wood J in Savage v Savage [1982] Fam 100. In that case the court was faced with a petition on the grounds of unreasonable behaviour where the parties had reconciled for a period of three and a half years after decree nisi. The wife applied for the decree to be made absolute which was refused, and the decree rescinded. Wood J in his Judgment on reconciliation said this at 104B:
""In looking at the period of cohabitation it was argued that the quality of the cohabitation should be examined in each case to see how long the reconciliation continued. I am not convinced that that is the correct approach in view of the wording of many parts of section 2 of the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973. It is also extremely difficult to assess such a test and although cohabitation will always be with the hope of reconciliation, it is the living together which is the period which must be examined, in my judgment. All the factors which I have mentioned above lead me to the inevitable conclusion that the inference originally drawn under the special procedure, that the wife could not reasonably be expected to live with the husband, was the wrong inference, looked at in the light of all the circumstances now known.
To approach the problem in this way is not to undermine attempts at reconciliation. There is the period of 12 months referred to in rule 65 of the Matrimonial Causes Rules 1977 to which I have already referred and the periods of time outlined in section 2 of the Act of 1973 are within that span, thereafter the court has a discretion. It is perhaps surprising that the substantive law does not direct that a decree nisi shall lapse after a given period - possibly two years. This might help to cement any reconciliation which had taken place within that period and to encourage finality where the condition of the marriage was in reality hopeless.""
The Court of Appeal in Olga Cazalet v Walid Abu-Zalaf [2023] EWCA Civ 1065 held that that approach “dovetailed” with the approach of Cobb J in NP v TP (Divorce) [2022] EWFC 78, “one of the first points of reference should be whether there has been a “new even or material change of circumstances which invalidates the basis, or fundamental assumption, upon which the order was made” going on to formulate the test as (para 55)
“is the evaluative exercise carried out upon granting a decree nisi which led to the conclusion that it was unreasonable to expect the applicant to live with the respondent still valid in light of subsequent events? I have adopted the test as phrased in Savage, but the test applies to both elements of the decree nisi, namely the decision that the wife could not reasonably be expected to live with the husband and that the marriage has irretrievably broken down” (My emphasis)
Reasons For Delay
There are many reasons for delay where the Court will exercise its discretion and grant the final order
The delay has been to allow the parties to resolve their finances.
Due to ill health
As a result of some other family matter (a child or other family member has been unwell) and a party or parties have concentrated on that
In these circumstances the parties usually have not reconciled, and the final order granted.
The Applicant’s Submissions
Mr Ellis in his written submissions argues that whilst the parties attempted reconciliation, the parties’ reconciliation would not prevent the court making the conditional order final as, at the time of the application, they have separated. Both agree the final order and neither seek to rescind the order.  That could apply if the reconciliation was 1 month or 10 years.
He argues that the purpose of the DDSA was to make the divorce process less challenging for couples and from preventing a party/parties being tied to a marriage that had broken down. It is notable that the Act:
Allowed the mere application as sufficient grounds for divorce;
Removed the need to prove the ground was made out;
Prevented the defence of the application save for reasons of invalidity or lack of jurisdiction; and,
Obliged the court to make the conditional order final, if the application to do so was made within 12, save for limited exceptions;
Discussion and Conclusion
A marriage subsists until the making of a final order. If the Court does not grant the application, then it follows that it would have to rescind the conditional order a step that the Court does not take lightly.
Parties should not be dissuaded for reconciling or attempting to reconcile, and the court must acknowledge the changes that the DDSA have heralded.  In my judgment the test in Olga Cazalet v Walid Abu-Zalaf applies.
The question for the Court then becomes for what period should parties be allowed to attempt to reconcile before it invalidates the basis upon which the conditional order was made and that the original statement that the marriage has broken down irretrievably can no longer stand?
The parties could attempt to reconcile for just under a year between conditional and final order without any enquiry from the Court. Reconciliation may be gradual, and time should be allowed, adopting the words of Wood J, to allow any attempted reconciliation to “cement in”.
Prior to the DDSA one of the facts to prove the marriage had broken down irretrievably was that the parties had been separated for two years and the other party consented.  In my Judgment that further supports the argument that two years is a reasonable period to allow parties space and time to decide their future and decide if they wished to remain separated.
This case highlights that an attempted reconciliation takes time, and parties should be permitted that time. During that attempt the original basis for the divorce still stands. In my Judgment Wood J’s observations in Savage stand true some 40 years on. In this case the court is faced with an attempted reconciliation that has not worked and the marriage remains irretrievably broken down.
The application should be entitled to apply for final order.
In my judgment any period of reconciliation under two years should be seen as an attempt at reconciliation but not a bar to the Court allowing a final order to be made. This case highlights that parties need time to reflect.  They should not feel the pressure of an artificially imposed court timetable. Further in this case if I refuse the Application either party would be able to issue a new divorce application the following day.
Any period over two years may amount to evidence that the marriage has not irretrievably broken down and that the reconciliation for such a long period could amount to a material change in circumstances that invalidates the basis upon which the conditional order was made.  The Court of course approaches such applications by exercising its discretion and that includes at the final order stage taking into account all the facts known to it. That is a wide discretion but in my judgment parties and those that advise them need some guidance as to how that is likely to be exercised and I hope this provides that.

Approved Judgment
This judgment was handed down remotely at 10 a.m. on 14 January 2025 by circulation to the parties or their representatives by email and by release to the National Archives.
NICOLA RUSHTON KC:
I have before me an application by the Defendants to strike out the Claimant’s claim against them on grounds of abuse of process, and/or for summary judgment on the basis that the claim has no real prospect of succeeding. The claim is essentially for professional negligence and misconduct between 2008 to 2010 in the conduct of the administrations of a number of insolvent companies of which the Claimant was director, shareholder and/or guarantor, in particular in allegedly selling at an undervalue the development properties which were the main assets of those companies. The value of the claim was said on the Claim Form to be £1,206,600,000 plus interest.
The claim to a very great extent duplicates an earlier claim brought by the Claimant against the same Defendants in the Central London County Court (Claim Number J36YJ967, “the First Claim”). That First Claim was struck out and judgment was given in favour of the Defendants by an order of District Judge Greenidge of 10 July 2023, following a hearing which from the transcript took the best part of a day. Permission to appeal was refused on the papers by HHJ Saggerson on 27 October 2023. The Claimant renewed his application for permission orally and it was refused by HHJ Bloom on 9 May 2024. DJ Greenidge and HHJ Bloom each also found that respectively the claim and the application for permission to appeal were totally without merit. I have been provided with the transcripts of the judgments and the hearings before both DJ Greenidge and HHJ Bloom, as well as the bundles and other papers relating to those hearings.
The present claim was issued on 26 January 2024. This was before the Claimant’s oral application for permission to appeal on the First Claim had been dealt with, as he acknowledged to HHJ Bloom during the hearing before her. On 23 February 2024 the Defendants issued their application for strike out and summary judgment on the present claim. On 14 March 2024 Master Brightwell directed the Claimant to explain how the current claim differed from the First Claim, saying that it was not open to a dissatisfied litigant whose claim had been dismissed in one court to issue the same claim again in another. The Claimant has never responded to that direction.
On 22 April 2024 the Claimant issued an application for wide-ranging disclosure against the Defendants. On 24 April 2024 Master Brightwell directed that the question of whether that application needed to be listed would be considered at the conclusion of the hearing of the Defendants’ application, which he listed to be heard before him on 1 August 2024.
The hearing before Master Brightwell on 1 August 2024 was vacated because the Claimant’s counsel unfortunately contracted Covid. The application was therefore relisted, and came before me for hearing on 17 December 2024, with a time estimate of one day.
In his direction of 31 July 2024 vacating the hearing, and having reviewed the Defendants’ skeleton filed in support, Master Brightwell observed that rather than being a case where an issue estoppel or cause of action estoppel had arisen, this might rather be a case where the previous claim had been struck out without an adjudication on the issues, so that the applicable principles were those set out by the Court of Appeal in Securum Finance Ltd v. Ashton [2001] Ch 291 (“Securum”). He also noted that the Claimant had been made bankrupt after the events of which he complained, which appeared to create the fundamental objection that the Claimant had no standing to sue. The Master gave further directions which were intended to give the Defendants the opportunity to deal with the Securum point, Claimant’s counsel to file a skeleton in opposition to the application, and Defendants’ counsel to respond to the same. Regrettably Claimant’s counsel filed and served his skeleton late for the hearing before me, preventing Defendants’ counsel from responding to it in writing but I am satisfied that he had a proper opportunity to do so in oral submissions.
The Claimant has for the most part acted as a litigant in person, but he was represented at the hearing before me by counsel, Mr Timothy Becker, acting on a direct access basis. The Defendants have been represented throughout, as they were in the First Claim, by counsel Mr Matthew Abraham, instructed by Stephenson Harwood LLP. I am grateful to both counsel for their submissions in writing and at the hearing.
On 19 July 2024 the Claimant applied to amend his Particulars of Claim, attaching proposed draft amended Particulars. The Defendants have helpfully provided a red-lined version showing the proposed amendments. That application was also listed to be heard before me. Mr Abraham on behalf of the Defendants did not oppose the amendments, on the basis that he wanted the strike out and summary judgment to extend to any amended claim. Accordingly I will consider the Defendants’ application on the basis that the Particulars of Claim have been amended under CPR rule 17.1(2)(a), without therefore any acknowledgement or finding that the amendments have rendered the claim reasonably arguable. By the amendments the Claimant among other things reduced the size of his claim to £25,000,000, and added additional heads of claim which are closely related to the original ones.
There is no dispute that the Claimant was made bankrupt on 23 March 2009, after all the relevant companies had entered administration. He was discharged from bankruptcy on 20 August 2012. A representative of the Official Receiver attended the hearing before me as an observer.
The Defendants’ application for strike out and summary judgment was made on a number of alternative grounds, so I will approach these in the manner which seems to me logical.
Abuse of process under CPR 3.4(2)(b) and Securum
Mr Abraham’s primary submission was that the claim should be struck out under CPR 3.4(2)(b) on the basis “that the statement of case is an abuse of the court’s process or is otherwise likely to obstruct the just disposal of the proceedings” because it essentially replicates the First Claim, which has itself been struck out and dismissed, and judgment entered for the Defendants.
Although the First Claim was disposed of at an interim hearing, Mr Abraham submitted that it was adjudicated upon on its merits, because DJ Greenidge struck it out under CPR 3.4(2)(a) as well as under sub-paragraph (b), and also granted summary judgment. Mr Abraham took me to the extended recital to DJ Greenidge’s order, in which the District Judge set out that he had considered, and was including within the definition of the Claimant’s claim:
“… (i) the Claimant’s claim dated 25 October 2022; (ii) the particulars of claim filed in respect of it; (iii) the ‘Detailed Supplementary Claim Statement Submission as Requested by the Defendants’ document dated 29 December 2022; (iv) the further particulars dated 7 February 2023 ‘in reference to the defendants’ response [to the Claimant’s request for further information] dated 25 January 2023’; (v) the further particulars by way of the Claimant's document dated 1 April 2023 entitled ‘In reference to the defendants’ response of refusal to correspond via part 18 Procedure And Court order to correspond for conclusion date 25.03.2023’; (vi) the further particulars by way of the Claimant's ‘Position Statement as ordered by HHJ Ellington on the 25.March.2023’, dated 20 April 2023; (vii) the further particulars by way of a document titled ‘Skeleton Argument in Support Towards Part 18 Sanctions Against The Defendants’ dated 26 April 2023; (viii) the Claimant's application dated 14 June 2023 for an order ‘Detailing and expanding of the Particulars of Claim submitted 25.10.2023 to the court and defendants with the supplementary witness statement and part 18 witness statements issued between 28.12.2022 and 02.06.2023’; (ix) the Claimant's skeleton argument dated 15 June 2023; and (x) the Claimant's ‘supplementary Claimant witness statement’ dated 6 July 2023 (the Claim)”
Mr Abraham submitted that the current claim was an abuse of process because it sought to relitigate the First Claim, which was disposed of on its merits. He said that the Claimant had admitted this before HHJ Bloom and also in an application for a stay which he issued in the present claim on 28 February 2024, in which the Claimant said in his witness statement in support:
I issued proceedings against the Defendants in Central London County Court. My claim is substantial. That Court said my claim should be transferred to the High Court as it was above the County Court Limit.
Instead, the Defendants applied to strike out my claim on the basis that my pleading was incoherent. On 10 July 2023 District Judge Greenidge struck out my case.
I applied for permission to appeal within the time limit. Eventually my application was refused on paper. I straight away applied for an oral hearing. After all this time I am told the Central London Cou[n]ty Court will list my hearing soon.
In the meantime, I issued the current claim which covers the same case. I did this because I was concerned that my case may become ineligible due to limitation periods. It was only in 2021 onwards that I gained information which showed me that I had a claim.”
Mr Abraham submitted that the claim should be struck out as an abuse of process because the striking out and dismissal of the First Claim has created a cause of action or issue estoppel. He relied on the principles summarised by the Chancellor, Sir Julian Flaux as to cause of action estoppel in Margulies v Margulies [2022] EWHC 2843 (Ch) at [50]:
“A cause of action estoppel arises where the cause of action in the later proceedings is the same as the cause of action in the earlier proceedings. It is an absolute bar in relation to all points which had to be and were decided in order to establish the existence or non-existence of a cause of action”
And at [49], as to identifying a cause of action:
“A cause of action is a factual situation the existence of which entitles a person to obtain a remedy from the court, consisting of every fact which the claimant must prove: see the statement of Millett LJ in Paragon Finance Plc v DB Thakerar & Co [1999] 1 All ER 400 at 405, referring to the earlier authorities. As Millett LJ went on to say: ""The selection of the material facts to define the cause of action must be made at the highest level of abstraction."" See also per Barling J in The Manchester Ship Canal Company Ltd v United Utilities Water Ltd [2019] EWHC 1495 (Ch) at [78]–[80]. In considering what was the cause of action in earlier proceedings, the court can take account not just of the particulars of claim, but of all the material before it: Spencer Bower and Handley: Res Judicata (5th edition) [7.16].”
Insofar as there are additional causes of action in the current claim, as amended, which were not in the First Claim, Mr Abraham submits that an issue estoppel arises. He relies on the decision of the Supreme Court in Virgin Atlantic Airways Ltd v Zodiac Seats UK Ltd [2014] AC 160 (SC), which characterised issue estoppel as:
“the principle that even where the cause of action is not the same in the later action as it was in the earlier one, some issue which is necessarily common to both was decided on the earlier occasion and is binding on the parties” [17].
The Supreme Court went on to confirm that:
“Except in special circumstances where this would cause injustice, issue estoppel bars the raising in subsequent proceedings of points which (i) were not raised in the earlier proceedings or (ii) were raised but unsuccessfully. If the relevant point was not raised, the bar will usually be absolute if it could with reasonable diligence and should in all the circumstances have been raised” [22(3)].
He also referred me to the principles of issue estoppel as summarised by Dias J in Fibula Air Travel Srl v Just-Us Air Srl [2023] EWHC 1049 (Comm) at [19]:
“…(b)  Even where the subsequent proceedings involve a different cause of action, a decision on a particular issue which formed a necessary ingredient of the earlier cause of action and is also relevant to the subsequent cause of action is binding on the parties and cannot be reopened: Arnold(supra) at 105E.
The relevant question in this respect is whether resolution of the issue was a ""necessary step"" to the decision or a ""matter which it was necessary to decide and which was actually decided, as the groundwork of the decision"": see Seele Austria (supra) at [18] quoting Lord Wilberforce in Carl Zeiss Stiftung v Rayner and Keeler Ltd (No. 2), [1967] AC 853. A mere dispute about facts divorced from their legal consequences is not an ""issue"" for these purposes: Fidelitas Shipping Co. Ltd v V/O Exportchleb, [1966] 1 QB 630, 641. The test is whether the determination was so fundamental to the substantive decision that the latter cannot stand without the former: P&O Nedlloyd(supra) at [23]-[24] quoting with approval from Spencer Bower, Turner and Handley, the Doctrine of Res Judicata (3rd ed.);
For this purpose, it is permissible to look not only at the judgment but also at the pleadings, evidence and, if necessary, other material in order to show what issue was actually decided: see Seele Austria(supra) at [18] quoting Carl Zeiss(supra)…”
Mr Abraham’s submission was that the cause of action in the present claim was at its core the same as in the First Claim, as the Claimant admitted. Both the First and current claims were for professional negligence against the Defendants and included the same allegations of (i) failing to ensure the various companies exited administration on a solvent basis; (ii) selling assets of the companies at an undervalue; (iii) acting where there was a conflict of interest; (iv) disclosing information to third parties, including government bodies; and (v) failing to keep proper records. Mr Abraham then cross-referenced paragraphs from the current claim to paragraphs from the First Claim where the same allegations were made in both under each of those five heads.
In addition Mr Abraham submitted that DJ Greenidge’s judgment gave rise to binding issue estoppels on a number of central matters which went to the viability of the current claim, namely that he concluded (paragraph numbers referring to his judgment) that:
there was no evidence of an assumption of responsibility sufficient to found a duty of care owed by the Defendants [7];
the Claimant was unable to establish how breaches of duty alleged had caused any loss [8];
the First Claim was limitation barred in that “the causes of action arose at the very latest in May 2011.  Therefore any claim would have needed to have been brought by May 2017.  The case was issued in December 2022 and would therefore have been caught by limitation” [14];
“even if there were causes of action which could be pursued, those causes of action vest in the trustee in bankruptcy” [15].
Finally insofar as any part of the present claim had not formed part of the First Claim, Mr Abraham submitted that it should have been brought as part of that claim. He relied on the principles in  Henderson v Henderson (1843) 3 Hare 100 as summarised by Lord Leggatt in the Privy Council in Finzi v Jamaican Redevelopment Foundation Inc [2023] UKPC 29; [2024] 1 WLR 541 at [32]-[33]:
The doctrine of res judicata in its narrow sense prohibits a party from relitigating a decision in earlier proceedings that a cause of action does or does not exist (cause of action estoppel) or an issue decided in earlier proceedings (issue estoppel). There is also a broader principle, first stated by Wigram V-C in Henderson v Henderson (1843) 3 Hare 100, which precludes a party from raising in subsequent proceedings matters which were not, but which could and should have been, raised in earlier proceedings. This principle is wider than the narrow res judicata doctrine in two respects: it applies, not to matters decided by a court, but to matters which could have been decided but were not; and it applies to parties to the subsequent proceedings even if they were not parties to the earlier proceedings (or their privies). Like the narrow doctrine of res judicata, however, this broader principle also rests on the public interest in the finality of litigation. As stated by Sir Thomas Bingham MR in Barrow v Bankside Members Agency Ltd [1996] 1 WLR 257, 260:
‘[The Henderson principle] is a rule of public policy based on the desirability, in the general interest as well as that of the parties themselves, that litigation should not drag on for ever and that a defendant should not be oppressed by successive suits when one would do. That is the abuse at which the rule is directed.’
In general, the question whether a matter which could have been raised in earlier proceedings “should” have been raised in those proceedings depends on a “broad, merits-based judgment” that takes account of all the public and private interests involved and all the facts of the case and focuses on “the crucial question whether, in all the circumstances, a party is misusing or abusing the process of the court by seeking to raise before it the issue which could have been raised before”: Johnson v Gore Wood & Co [2002] 2 AC 1, 31 (Lord Bingham of Cornhill). As a matter of law, there is no distinction to be drawn between cases where the original action concludes by judgment and where it concludes by settlement: Aldi Stores Ltd v WSP Group plc [2008] 1 WLR 748, para 11. The Henderson principle applies equally to both.”
Mr Abraham submitted that the current claim was the same claim as the First Claim, but even if this was not the case for some element, any new element could and should have been brought within the First Claim and the Claimant was misusing the court’s process by continuing to seek to bring claims against the Defendants which on any view arose out of the same factual matters which had already been rejected.
On the query raised by Master Brightwell, whether rather than being a case where res judicata principles applied, the application should instead be considered by reference to Securum principles as it might be said there had been no adjudication on the First Claim because it had been struck out for being “vague and incoherent”, Mr Abraham submitted:
There had been an adjudication, because DJ Greenidge had found an abuse of process under CPR 3.4(2)(a), i.e. that the statement of case disclosed no reasonable grounds for bringing the claim, and had also granted summary judgment, so res judicata principles could apply. Mr Abraham relied on an extract from Zuckerman on Civil Procedure (4th edition) at 9.43 to 9.47 to the effect that a distinction should be drawn between cases where the claim is struck out after a consideration of the substantive merits leading to the conclusion that it discloses no reasonable grounds for bringing the claim, and claims which are struck out or dismissed for non-compliance or abuse not entailing any substantive consideration, such as for excessive delay or breach of an unless order.
However, if contrary to this submission there had not been an adjudication, then according to Securum, since the First Claim had been struck out for abuse of process, the Claimant would have to identify a “special reason” to allow the new claim to proceed, which he had not done. Applying Securum at [34], whether to allow the present claim to continue was for the discretion of the court, bearing in mind the overriding objective and whether the Claimant’s wish to have a “second bite at the cherry” outweighed the need to allot the court’s limited resources to other cases, and considering any excuse given for the misconduct in the First Claim. It had to start with the assumption that if a party has had one action struck out for abuse of process, some special reason has to be identified to justify a second action being allowed to proceed. The First Claim had been held to be abusive, had already taken up substantial court time and resources, the Claimant had failed to pay the £25,000 on account of costs which he had been ordered by pay by DJ Greenidge, and it was not consistent with the overriding objective for the Claimant to launch proceedings seeking over a billion pounds and then reissue the same claim without any change in circumstances, so that it was effectively a collateral attack on DJ Greenidge’s decision. There were therefore no “special reasons” to allow the new claim to continue.
On behalf of the Claimant, Mr Becker submitted in response that, on the point on Securum raised by Master Brightwell, it was right as a matter of principle that the principles of res judicata, including the rule in Henderson, did not apply where the earlier proceedings had been terminated prematurely without any substantive adjudication or settlement. He submitted that the present case was one where, applying the principles in Securum, the court did need to be satisfied that there were special reasons to allow the current claim to proceed, the First Claim having been struck out as an abuse of process.
Mr Becker referred me to the examples in the notes in the White Book (2024 edition) at paragraph 3.4.8 of cases falling within the Securum principles. Having looked at those cases together in the hearing, we agreed these were examples of procedural failure where there was no adjudication on the merits. In C (A Child) v CPS Fuels Ltd [2001] EWCA Civ 1597, the claim had been struck out for failure to comply with an unless order. In Aktas v Adepta [2010] EWCA Civ 1170, the claim was struck out for failure to serve the claim form in time. In Davies v Carillion Energy Services Ltd [2017] EWHC 3206 (QB); [2018] 1 W.L.R. 1734, the claim was struck out for failure to file and serve particulars of claim pursuant to an unless order. Harbour Castle Ltd v David Wilson Homes Ltd [2019] EWCA Civ 505 concerned strike out for failure to comply with an unless order to provide security of costs. Kishore v Revenue and Customs Commissioners [2021] EWCA Civ 505 was another example of strike out for failure to comply with an unless order. The only slightly different example was Cranway Ltd v Playtech Ltd [2008] EWHC 550 (Pat) where the first action had been struck out for failure to comply with a practice direction dealing with the requirements for a pleading. Lewison J (as he then was) applied the Securum test on the basis the court must take a broad view of the reasons why the original action was struck out and the stage at which it was struck out. He concluded that it was an important factor that the original claim had not been struck out as an abuse of process.
Mr Becker accepted in his oral submissions that there were no examples of Securum principles being applied where the first claim had been dismissed or struck out for “summary judgment type” reasons, i.e. a summary determination of the substantive merits, and he said I therefore had a “clean canvas”. He also agreed that the claims raised in the current claim were the same as those raised before DJ Greenidge, except for some “bolt-ons” which he acknowledged were very small in comparison to the other claims. For example, the amended claim includes an apparently new claim alleging eviction of the Claimant from one of the properties, and a claim in connection with an additional company, Construction Link Ltd, for alleged removal without authority of vehicles and machinery belonging to it, from one of the repossessed properties.
On the basis that Securum principles should be applied here, Mr Becker submitted that there were special reasons for allowing the new claim to continue, because the Claimant had not had all the information he needed when he brought the First Claim. He submitted that this case was analogous to Walbrook Trustees (Jersey) Ltd v Fattal [2009] EWCA Civ 297, where it was held that a second claim should not have been struck out as an abuse of process because the appellant trustees did not know certain necessary facts at the time an earlier claim had been brought, because the relevant information had been concealed from them by the respondent. If they had sought to make the new claim at the time of the original claim, it would have been struck out because of the absence of the concealed information. As such, it was held the second claim could not be abusive.
Mr Becker contended that since the Claimant still had an application for disclosure by the Defendants which had not yet been determined, at the time of the First Claim he did not have (and still did not have) all the necessary information to bring his claim. As an example he said there was reference within the administrators’ reports to Construction Link Ltd’s assets.
In paragraph 148-149 of the new claim (101-102 in the amended claim) the Claimant alleges that the Defendants deliberately withheld information from him, thereby preventing him from knowing whether he had a case. He alleges that such information only came to light in 2022 and 2023, listing 11 categories of such alleged information.
On the specific point as to disclosure of documents, Mr Abraham replied that the Claimant had been provided with copies of all the administrators’ reports on all of the companies, as part of the First Claim (which was why the papers were so voluminous) and these reports were in any event public documents filed at Companies House at the relevant time, so that the Claimant would have had contemporaneous constructive knowledge of them. He referred me to the letter referring to Construction Link Ltd’s assets, which was from KPMG to Barclays Bank Plc and dated 8 May 2008. This letter said on page 4, under the heading “Risks”, “The construction assets may belong to Construction Link, a Company with security and debt of £1.5m with Lloyds”. It is this statement which it is said the Claimant relies on as new information. However, Mr Abraham said, this letter was referred to at paragraph 12.2 of the witness statement of Mr Julian Cahn of the Defendants’ solicitors dated 23 February 2024, filed in support of the present application by the Defendants; and exhibited thereto.
In the context of an argument around limitation, Mr Abraham further said that the Claimant had provided no evidence of any concealment by the Defendants. Lack of access to documents did not amount to deliberate concealment. Mr Abraham relied on evidence in the statement of Mr Cahn of 23 February 2024 at paragraph 53 as answering why all the various categories of information listed by the Claimant in his Particulars of Claim either had been provided, were publicly available and/or were irrelevant.
Decision on abuse of process under CPR 3.4(2)(b) and Securum
On this head of the application for strike out for abuse of process, under CPR 3.4(2)(b), my conclusion is that DJ Greenidge did make a substantive adjudication on the merits of the Claimant’s claim in the First Claim when he struck it out and granted judgment to the Defendants on 10 July 2023.
At paragraphs [5] to [11] of his judgment the District Judge said the following, before concluding that the claim should be struck out under CPR 3.4(2)(a) as disclosing no reasonable grounds for bringing the claim, saying also that the Claimant had been given ample opportunity over several months to amend his case:
The claimant has in my opinion tried his best to set out what his case is. Based on his submissions, I understand… it is a claim for professional negligence against the defendants, for their failure to take action to prevent the sale of the properties at an undervalue.  The claim, which was issued on 24 November 2022, is valued in the region of £1.4 billion.  The claimant says that KPMG, the first defendants, and Mr David James Costley-Wood, the second defendant, were negligent and that he has a claim in common law in respect of that negligence.
The defendants’ case, as argued by Mr Abrahams, is the particulars of claim disclose no reasonable ground for bringing this claim and are also an abuse of process.  For the reasons I shall give, in my judgment, the application in respect of the strike-out is made out and succeeds.
In my judgment, the basis of the claim is very unclear. The claimant alleges that he was owed a duty of care by the defendants which would meet the requirements for the first limb of any claim for professional negligence. However, as was referred to by Mr Abraham in his submissions, Sir Geoffrey Vos C, in the Court of Appeal, in Fraser Turner Limited v PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP & Ors [2019] held, in relation to administrators, that there must be an assumption of responsibility such as to create a special relationship between in this case the claimant and the defendants.  There is no evidence at all from the claimant of any such special relationships. If one considers the judgment of Sir Geoffrey Vos C, it does not appear any special promises were made, or any agreements reached which would create some special relationship. Therefore, in terms of the duty of care, it is not clear at all from the claimant’s pleaded case what duty was owed.
The second criterion is in respect of breach of the duty owed. Again, on the claimant’s case as pleaded there is no clear statement as to what the claimant alleges the breach of duty involved. For the avoidance of doubt, in respect of the claimant’s pleaded case, I mean the claim form and the detailed supplementary statement which appears in the bundle, which the claimant has not got permission to rely on, nor has he made any application to amend or rely on the supplementary statement, but I have… in any event considered.
In respect of the causation, having considered the documents and heard from the claimant over the course of the two hearings, again on the claimant’s pleaded case I have been unable to establish how he suffered any loss by reason of the defendants’ conduct.
Finally, in relation to the recoverability, this is a claim valued at £1.4 billion. I have not seen any independent or corroborative evidence as to how those sums have been calculated. The evidence upon which the claimant relies falls well short of explaining the losses he seeks to claim.
Therefore, I am satisfied that CPR3.4(2)(a) is met in so far as the case as pleaded discloses no reasonable grounds for bringing the claim. The claimant in his submissions rightly pointed out that “strike out” is a draconian step, and I accept that is so. However, in my judgment taken at its highest the case as pleaded is vague, difficult to understand and in places incoherent. There are, because of the nature of strike out, grounds upon which the claimant might have sought permission to amend his particulars of claim. However, in my judgment he has already had ample opportunity to do so, particularly given at the last hearing on 23 June 2023, the prospect was raised of him providing amended particulars of claim. I am satisfied therefore that it would be inappropriate make an order allowing him to amend his claim at this stage. On the submissions I have heard, had there been any formal application for such before me today, that application would not have been granted.”
As I have quoted at paragraph 18 above, DJ Greenidge went on to hold further in relation to the substantive merits of the First Claim, at [14] that the claim was barred by limitation in that the causes of action arose at the latest in May 2011, and at [15] that the causes of action arose during the period when the Claimant was bankrupt and so even if there were any causes of action which could be pursued, they would have vested in his trustee in bankruptcy.
In my view the determination by DJ Greenidge that the Claimant’s claim disclosed no reasonable grounds for bringing the claim, so that it fell to be struck out under CPR 3.4(2)(a) necessarily involved and did involve a consideration and adjudication upon the substantive merits of the Claimant’s claim as presented in his statement of case and the other witness statements, draft particulars and further information relied on by him. It was a conclusion that the merits of that claim as presented were so hopeless that there was no justification in allowing the claim to continue. This also led directly to DJ Greenidge finding that the claim was totally without merit.
I agree with the author of Zuckerman on Civil Procedure (4th edition) where he says at 9.44:
“Striking out on the grounds that the statement of case discloses no reasonable claim or defence is different in nature from striking out for abuse of process or non-compliance. The first is a decision on the substantive merits of the claim, because the court effectively holds that the claim or defence is groundless. By contrast, a court that strikes out a statement of case for abuse of process or for non-compliance generally expresses no view about the substantive merits. There may, however, be a certain overlap between CPR 3.4(2)(a) and (b), in that a statement of case may be struck out if it is vague, incoherent or badly drafted. Striking out on such grounds is still a decision on the substantive merits, for there is no difference between saying that the particulars of claim as drafted reveal no cause of action (invoking CPR 3.4(2)(a)), and saying that they are too incoherent to enable a just disposal (invoking CPR 3.4(2)(b)). In both situations, the court decides that the particulars of claim cannot justify the remedy sought. Notwithstanding this overlap, it is important to keep in view the distinction between a decision on the substantive merits and a decision on grounds of abuse of process or non-compliance. The former decision involves an examination of the party’s entitlement under the substantive law; the latter does not…”
And at 9.50:
“… It is plainly wrong to suggest that a party who has had the benefit of an (albeit abbreviated) hearing on the merits in a court of competent jurisdiction has been denied access to court adjudication. Every modern system has a variety of procedures for disposing of different types of cases depending on their value, complexity, importance and so on... “
While there may well be cases of strike out under CPR 3.4(2) (a) and (b) which are in a grey area between procedural strike out and substantive adjudication, where resort to the Securum principles will be preferable, I do not consider that the present case is one of them. DJ Greenidge had voluminous papers before him, including multiple attempts by the Claimant to rework and re-express his intended claim, and the judge spent extensive time in the hearing seeking to understand what that claim was. This is well illustrated by the list of 10 sources of information as to the Claimant’s case which the judge set out in the recital to his order, which I have quoted at paragraph 12 above. I consider that he clearly made a decision under sub-paragraph (a) of CPR 3.4(2) that the statement of case disclosed no reasonable grounds, even though he also considered that it was so vague and incoherent as to justify strike out under sub-paragraph (b). In any event, I agree with Zuckerman that a decision that a claim is vague and incoherent is a decision on the substantive merits of the claim, even if it could be made under either sub-rule (a) or (b). It is fair to say that DJ Greenidge’s judgment does not explicitly rule on the application for summary judgment as well, but he says that the “Defendants’ application should be granted” and his order does provide that the Defendants shall have judgment against the Claimant.
That DJ Greenidge’s judgment amounted to an adjudication is in my view reinforced by the decision of HHJ Bloom on the Claimant’s oral application for permission to appeal, in particular at [24] to [26] and [31] to [39], where she was clearly undertaking a review of DJ Greenidge’s decisions on the substantive merits of the Claimant’s case as pleaded.
My conclusion therefore is that the strike out by DJ Greenidge under CPR 3.4(2)(a), together with his order of judgment for the Defendants, was an adjudication on the merits of the Claimant’s claim which brings into play the principles of cause of action estoppel, issue estoppel and the Henderson principle.
Mr Becker does not dispute on behalf of the Claimant that the present claim duplicates the First Claim, with what he calls some “bolt-ons”. I accept Mr Abraham’s submissions as to the obvious parallels between the case as pleaded in the First Claim and in the new claim. In addition the Claimant freely admitted that the new claim replicated the First Claim, when he said in his witness statement in support of his stay application in the new claim, “in the meantime, I issued the current claim which covers the same case”.
My conclusion is that insofar as the current claim includes any causes of action at all, which may be unlikely given its incoherence, virtually all of it repeats the causes of action which were disposed of in the First Claim. More significantly, given the incoherence of the First Claim, I consider that there is an issue estoppel in that DJ Greenidge has determined that the factual allegations relied on by the Claimant in the First Claim and repeated in the current claim disclosed no reasonable grounds for bringing any claim. Insofar as there are additional claims in the current claim, such as the reference to eviction or to a claim in respect of the assets of Construction Link Ltd, either these arise out of the same factual circumstances, so that they are also covered by that issue estoppel, or they are so closely related to those circumstances that they should have been brought at the same time as the First Claim (insofar as there is any merit in them, and I have seen no evidence that there is any such merit) and so are barred under the Henderson principle.
If I am wrong that DJ Greenidge’s judgment constituted an adjudication on the First Claim, then it would be necessary to consider the Defendants’ application by reference to the Securum principles, which I propose to do therefore, in the alternative.
Applying Securum principles, for the current claim to continue it would be necessary to identify a special reason to allow it to proceed, because the First Claim has been struck out as an abuse of process. In deciding how the court should exercise that discretion, Chadwick LJ stated at [36] in Securum that “it is necessary to examine the events which led to the striking out of the first action…”
Here the First Claim was struck out as an abuse of process under 3.4(2)(a) and (b). It and the application for permission to appeal were both judged to be totally without merit. The costs order arising from the First Claim has not been paid by the Claimant and he has failed to respond to the Master’s direction that he explain why the new claim differed from the First Claim. In fact the current claim essentially repeats the First Claim, which itself was struck out on the grounds that it raised no arguable cause of action, and was vague and incoherent, rather than having been struck out for a non-compliance unrelated to the merits of the claim. These factors all point strongly towards refusing to permit this claim to proceed, and striking it out as an abuse of process.
I do not accept Mr Becker’s contention that the Claimant’s position is analogous to that of the trustees in the Walbrook Trustees case or that there is any evidence that important information relating to the Claimant’s claim has been concealed from him. There is no general principle that a claimant in a professional negligence claim can obtain either pre-action or early disclosure of documents from the defendants. In any event the Defendants have in fact provided a large volume of material relating to the administrations to the Claimant, in the First Claim, despite the extremely stale nature of the claim and the fact that much of that documentation was publicly available. No evidence has been provided by the Claimant of any concealment by the Defendants of any information or document necessary for him to bring a valid claim. He is simply asking the court to infer concealment from the fact he has applied for disclosure of documents which he claims have not been provided. That is entirely to misunderstand the nature of concealment, and I decline to draw any such inference.
In the recent decision of Canada Square Operations Ltd v Potter [2023] UKSC 41 the Supreme Court considered once again the definition of “deliberate concealment” for the purposes of the extension of the limitation period, under s.32(1)(b) of the Limitation Act 1980, an issue which has also been raised and on which I heard argument on this application. The Supreme Court concluded at [109] on deliberate concealment that:
“What is required is (1) a fact relevant to the claimant's right of action, (2) the concealment of that fact from her by the defendant, either by a positive act of concealment or by a withholding of the relevant information, and (3) an intention on the part of the defendant to conceal the fact or facts in question.”
Applying this test to the broad allegations of concealment made by the Claimant for a number of purposes, including to avoid the strike out of his claim but also on limitation, my conclusion is that there is no evidence before me of any positive acts of concealment or of withholding of relevant information by the Defendants, nor material from which one could infer any intention to conceal facts relevant to a right of action of the Claimant, nor even as to what are the facts relevant to any cause of action of the Claimant which are said to have been concealed.
Whether in the context of an alleged extension to the limitation period or in considering whether there is any special reason not to strike out the current claim as an abuse of process, there is in my view no evidence of concealment by the Defendants, properly understood.
As I have already indicated, applying the Securum principles, all material factors would point strongly towards striking out the present claim as an abuse of process in any event.
Accordingly, whichever type of abuse of process under CPR 3.4(2)(b) is raised by the previous striking out of the First Claim, my conclusion is that the present claim should be struck out in its entirety as an abuse of process, and I so order.
Other bases of strike out or summary judgment
In the alternative, the Defendants seek the strike out of this claim under 3.4(2)(a) and (b) on the basis that the Claimant’s statement of case (as amended) discloses no reasonable grounds for bringing the claim, alternatively they apply for summary judgment. This is essentially on the same basis as the case was put to DJ Greenidge. Indeed I have been referred to the witness statement of Mr Cahn of 22 December 2022 which was filed and served in support of the application before the District Judge.
However, save for one specific respect, I have concluded that it is neither necessary nor appropriate for me to go on to undertake what would effectively be a reconsideration of all the points which were argued before DJ Greenidge and considered by HHJ Bloom on the application for permission to appeal. To do so would in a way be to give the Claimant the second bite of the cherry, and waste resources, in a way that my strike out of the claim under CPR 3.4(2)(b) by reference to the strike out of the First Claim is intended to prevent, and I decline to do so. I should emphasise that I have not therefore set out in this judgment the numerous bases on which the Defendants contest the Claimant’s claims, and nothing in this judgment should be read as accepting the validity of any part of those claims.
The one point I have concluded I should deal with is the application to strike out the claim on the basis that the matters complained of pre-date the Claimant’s bankruptcy, so he has no standing to bring the present claim.
Whilst at the time that the evidence (in the form of the witness statement of Mr Cahn dated 22 December 2022) in support of the Defendants' application to strike out the First Claim was signed, the Defendants believed wrongly that the Claimant had not been discharged from bankruptcy, by the time the matter was before DJ Greenidge I am told it was understood by all parties that the Claimant had been discharged on 20 August 2012.
In his oral submissions Mr Becker conceded both that his client had not had standing to bring either the First Claim or the present claim, which were vested in his trustee in bankruptcy (now the Official Receiver) insofar as they existed, and further that the Claimant knew that his earlier bankruptcy meant he was not entitled to bring any claim. However Mr Becker submitted that, applying the decisions of the Court of Appeal in Rajesh Pathania v Edmond Adefolu Adedeji; Grace Adebola Ajayi v Bank of Scotland PLC [2014] EWCA (Civ) 681 at [16], the position is capable of being regularised either by the joinder of the trustee or by the taking of an assignment from them.
I note further that it is not disputed that the Official Receiver has not agreed (at least to date) either to be joined to any claim or to assign any claim to the Claimant.
Mr Becker proposed that if I was otherwise minded to dismiss the application to strike out the claim, I should stay it pending an application by the Claimant to the insolvency court if the Official Receiver continued to resist the request to assign.
In Pathania the Court of Appeal at [12] - [13] referred to an unreported decision of the Court of Appeal in Pickthall v Hill Dickinson [2009] EWCA Civ 543 in which the former bankrupt had commenced proceedings because of the imminent expiry of a limitation period, at a time when he knew he did not have a cause of action but hoped he would obtain one by assignment from the Official Receiver. The Court of Appeal held this was an abuse of process, so the claim was liable to be struck out. It was improper for the former bankrupt to start proceedings knowing the cause of action was vested in someone else. Furthermore, they refused permission to amend to plead the subsequent assignment. The former bankrupt was therefore unable to pursue his claim at all, since a fresh action would have been statute barred.
At [15] - [16] the Court of Appeal in Pathania stated their conclusions as to the applicable principles in the following terms:
Where a bankrupt is commencing or pursuing a claim which he knows he does not have, the abuse of process in commencing or pursuing that claim is obvious. No claimant is entitled to sue on a right which he knows belongs to someone else. The abuse lies in knowingly pursuing a claim which, as presently constituted, is bound to fail.  The abuse does, however, depend on actual knowledge of the lack of title to the cause of action, not on what he or she ought to have known.
Nevertheless, where an action is commenced or continued after the cause of action has vested in a trustee in bankruptcy, the action does not abate and the position is capable of being regularised by the joinder of the trustee or by the taking of an assignment from him.  Whether the court will permit that to happen will involve an exercise of discretion. It will be necessary to have regard to the interests of those likely to be affected, including the creditors in the bankruptcy.  The court would be likely to stay the action until the position in the bankruptcy is clarified.”
Mr Abraham submitted that paragraph [15] represented the position so far as the Claimant was concerned, since there was no dispute that he knew he did not have a cause of action when he issued the claim. The claim should therefore be struck out.
Mr Becker submitted that paragraphs [15] and [16] needed to be read together even where a claimant had actual knowledge of his lack of title to the cause of action and that the court had a discretion to stay the action as suggested in [16] even in such a case.
My view is that paragraph [15] should be read as affirming the decision in Pickthall, that where the claimant knows he does not have title to the action by reason of his bankruptcy, the claim is improper and abusive and should be struck out without more. In my view paragraph [16] must therefore be intended to refer to situations where such actual knowledge does not exist.
In Pickthall the Court of Appeal concluded that the claim should be struck out even though there had been a subsequent assignment and the context was imminent expiry of a limitation period. A fortiori the claim should be struck out as abusive where, as in the present case, the Claimant knows not only that any cause of action is not vested in him but also that the Official Receiver has not agreed, at least to date, to assign any claim to him.
Given the abusive nature of the claim on this specific basis also, I consider that I should also strike out the claim on the basis that the Claimant has no standing to bring it because any claim which does exist is vested in the Official Receiver, and the Claimant has known this at all material times, not least because DJ Greenidge also held that the Claimant had no standing for the same reason.
Totally without merit
In the event that I struck out the claim as an abuse of process, as I have done, the Defendants also asked that I make a formal finding that the claim was totally without merit for the purposes of CPR 3.4(6).
I am entirely persuaded that the current claim was doomed to fail both because it was abusive under CPR 3.4(2)(b) by reason of the strike out of the First Claim, and because the Claimant has no standing to bring any claim since it is vested in the Official Receiver, in both cases for the reasons set out above.
As such I find that the claim is totally without merit.
I will give consideration under CPR 3.4(6)(b) to whether it is appropriate to make a civil restraint order (there having been two previous findings that claims or applications by the Claimant were totally without merit) after hearing further submissions at the costs and consequentials hearing to be listed to follow handing down of this judgment.

LORD HAMBLEN:
Introduction
This appeal concerns whether the Court of Appeal of Trinidad and Tobago has jurisdiction to hear an appeal from a decision of the High Court granting or refusing bail to a person charged with murder.
The Bail Act 1994 (“the 1994 Act”) provided that bail could not be granted to a person charged with murder.
In Charles v Attorney General of Trinidad and Tobago Civil App No CA S 046 of 2021 the Court of Appeal held that, insofar as the 1994 Act excluded the High Court’s power to grant bail to persons charged with murder, its provisions were unconstitutional.  The Privy Council upheld that decision in Attorney General of Trinidad and Tobago v Charles [2022] UKPC 31.
On 19 July 2024, the Bail (Amendment) Act 2024 (“the 2024 Act”) received assent. It amended the 1994 Act to permit a Judge or Master of the High Court to grant bail to a person charged with murder where they can show “exceptional circumstances” to justify the granting of bail. It also introduced a right of appeal to the Court of Appeal where a person is refused or granted bail by a Judge of the High Court.
Between the Court of Appeal’s decision in Charles and the coming into force of the 2024 Act a number of applications for bail were made by those charged with murder.  These conjoined appeals concern such applications and attempts to appeal from the refusal of bail by the High Court.  The appellants in the Sahadeo appeal have now been tried and acquitted and so their appeal has been rendered moot.
Under the 1994 Act, a bail decision could be appealed to the Court of Appeal where a person appealed from a conviction by a Magistrate’s Court and bail had been refused or granted by the High Court (section 6A(1)); where a person had been refused or granted bail by a Master of the High Court (section 6A(1A)); and where the High Court granted or refused bail on an application under section 11(1) following the grant or refusal of bail by a Magistrate’s Court (section 11A(1)).  None of these provisions conferred a right of appeal where the application for bail was first made to the High Court.  Applications by those charged with murder had to be made to the High Court as, in accordance with the Charles decision, it was the only court which had the power to grant bail in such cases.
Before the Court of Appeal four possible bases for a right of appeal in such cases were put forward: (i) section 14(1), (2) and (5) of the Constitution of Trinidad and Tobago; (ii) section 6(4) of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act 1962 (“SCJA”); (iii) section 35 of the SCJA, and (iv) section 108(c) of the Constitution.
A majority of the Court of Appeal (Bereaux JA, with whom Wilson JA agreed) held that none of those provisions provided the appellants with a right of appeal, and that therefore the Court of Appeal did not have jurisdiction to hear the appeals. Boodoosingh JA dissented. He held that section 108(c) of the Constitution provided the appellants with a right of appeal.  This is the only one of the original grounds now relied upon by the appellants.  They also advance a new ground based on the 2024 Act.
The factual and procedural background
Since the Sahadeo appeal has been rendered moot, the Board will only address the background to the Keros Martin appeal.
The appellant Martin was charged with murder in December 2017 and was incarcerated in January 2018. He has been in custody, pending trial, ever since.
He applied to the High Court for bail in March 2022. The High Court (Brown-Antoine J) refused bail in June 2022.
On 31 May 2023 his appeal was dismissed by the Court of Appeal.
On 27 September 2023 the Court of Appeal gave final leave to appeal to the Privy Council.
The Constitution
Chapter 7 of the Constitution is entitled “The Judicature”. Within that chapter, section 108 provides:
“An appeal to the Court of Appeal shall be as of right from decisions of the High Court in the following, among other cases, that is to say:
any order or decision in any civil or criminal proceedings on questions as to the interpretation of this Constitution;
any order or decision given in exercise of the jurisdiction conferred on the High Court by section 14 (which relates to redress for contravention of the provisions for the protection of fundamental rights);
any order or decision given in the determination of any of the questions for the determination of which a right of access to the High Court is guaranteed by sections 4(a) and 5(1);
any order or decision of the High Court granting or refusing leave to institute proceedings for the determination of any question referred to it under section 52 or determining any such question (which relates to the appointment, qualification, election or membership of a Senator or a member of the House of Representatives, as the case may be);
any order or decision of a Court in the exercise of its jurisdiction to punish for contempt of Court, including criminal contempt.”
Section 109(1)(d) confers a further right of appeal to the Privy Council in all cases falling under section 108 (save for section 108(d)).
Section 108(c) refers to sections 4(a) and 5(1) of the Constitution.  These are contained in Chapter 1 entitled “The Recognition and Protection of Fundamental Human Rights and Freedoms” and provide:
“PART I
RIGHTS ENSHRINED
It is hereby recognised and declared that in Trinidad and Tobago there have existed and shall continue to exist, without discrimination by reason of race, origin, colour, religion or sex, the following fundamental human rights and freedoms, namely:
the right of the individual to life, liberty, security of the person and enjoyment of property and the right not to be deprived thereof except by due process of law;
….
(1) Except as is otherwise expressly provided in this Chapter and in section 54, no law may abrogate, abridge or infringe or authorise the abrogation, abridgment or infringement of any of the rights and freedoms hereinbefore recognised and declared.”
Sections 4(b) and 5(2) are also of relevance.  Section 4(b) states that one of the fundamental human rights and freedoms is the right to “the protection of the law”.  Section 5(2) spells out “in greater detail (though not necessarily exhaustively) what is included in the expression ‘due process of law’ to which the [individual is] entitled under [section 4(a)] … and ‘the protection of the law’ to which he [is] entitled under [section 4(b)]” – per Lord Diplock in Thornhill v Attorney General of Trinidad and Tobago [1981] AC 61, 70.  It provides:
Without prejudice to subsection (1), but subject to this Chapter and to section 54, Parliament may not—
authorise or effect the arbitrary detention, imprisonment or exile of any person;
impose or authorise the imposition of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment;
deprive a person who has been arrested or detained—
of the right to be informed promptly and with sufficient particularity of the reason for his arrest or detention;
of the right to retain and instruct without delay a legal adviser of his own choice and to hold communication with him;
of the right to be brought promptly before an appropriate judicial authority;
of the remedy by way of habeas corpus for the determination of the validity of his detention and for his release if the detention is not lawful;
authorise a Court, tribunal, commission, board or other authority to compel a person to give evidence unless he is afforded protection against self-incrimination and, where necessary to ensure such protection, the right to legal representation;
deprive a person of the right to a fair hearing in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice for the determination of his rights and obligations;
deprive a person charged with a criminal offence of the right—
to be presumed innocent until proved guilty according to law, but this shall not invalidate a law by reason only that the law imposes on any such person the burden of proving particular facts;
to a fair and public hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal; or
to reasonable bail without just cause;
deprive a person of the right to the assistance of an interpreter in any proceedings in which he is involved or in which he is a party or a witness, before a Court, commission, board or other tribunal, if he does not understand or speak English; or
deprive a person of the right to such procedural provisions as are necessary for the purpose of giving effect and protection to the aforesaid rights and freedoms.”
Section 14 should also be noted.  This confers a right to bring proceedings in the High Court for redress for contravention of any provisions of Chapter 1 of the Constitution (ie sections 1 to 14).  Section 108(b) gives a right of appeal from an order or decision made in exercise of that jurisdiction.
The judgment of the Court of Appeal
The majority Court of Appeal judgment was given by Bereaux JA.  He held that section 108(c) only applied to an order or decision determining “a constitutional question emanating from a section 4(a) right or 5(1) Parliamentary breach”.  In relation to bail, that means (i) the right under section 4(a) not to be deprived of liberty “except by due process of law” and (ii) the right under section 5(1) that Parliament should not by law abrogate, abridge or infringe those rights.  Where such a question arises then a right of access to the High Court is guaranteed.  In the present case, however, no such question arises.  As Bereaux J explained:
“…while the issue or grant of bail is a section 4(a) liberty issue, the refusal of bail by the High Court raises no constitutional question requiring access to the High Court for determination. Rather, the refusal of bail was a deprivation of liberty in the exercise of due process. (para 40)
…
The liberty right in section 4(a) is expressly limited by due process. Section 5(2)(f)(iii) provides that a person charged with a criminal offence should not be deprived of reasonable bail without just cause. If a judicial authority finds that there is just cause to deprive that person of bail then the right to liberty of the person charged is lawfully limited by due process. There is no question of the abrogation of the right.” (para 48(i))
In his dissenting judgment Boodoosingh JA held that a guaranteed right of access to the High Court is not limited to constitutional issues relating to bail but includes the issue of whether or not bail should be granted.
“Section 108(c) ... refers to an order or decision given (read refusal of bail) in the determination of any of the questions for the determination of which a right of access (there is a right of access to the High Court for bail [f]or murder) is guaranteed by sections 4(a) and 5(1) (of which bail is included). This language permits an appeal from the refusal of bail. The refusal of bail is manifestly an order or decision. It is a determination by a judge. It concerns a matter, bail, for which right of access to the court is guaranteed under section 4(a) or 5(1).” (para 67)
The Issues
The appellants contend that the Court of Appeal has jurisdiction to hear an appeal from a decision of the High Court granting or refusing bail to a person charged with murder on two bases:
Under section 108(c) of the Constitution and/or
Under the 2024 Act.
The Law Association of Trinidad and Tobago supports the appeal on the first of those issues.
Issue (1) – whether the Court of Appeal has jurisdiction under section 108(c) of the Constitution
Mr Ramlogan SC for the appellants submitted that section 108(c) is to be understood as follows:
Sections 4(a) and 5(1) of the Constitution guarantee a right of access to the High Court for the determination of certain questions.
Where the High Court makes an order or decision in the determination of one of those questions, section 108(c) provides a right of appeal to the Court of Appeal.
Determining whether section 108(c) is engaged therefore requires a two-step process. First, it is necessary to identify the question that the High Court was determining when it made the relevant order or decision. Secondly, it is necessary to determine whether that question is one in respect of which sections 4(a) and 5(1) of the Constitution guarantee a right of access to the High Court. If it is, then section 108(c) provides a right of appeal to the Court of Appeal.
If a question is sufficiently important that sections 4(a) and 5(1) guarantee a right of access to the High Court for the determination of that question, it is also important to ensure that that determination is correct. The framers of the Constitution achieved this by affording a right of appeal to the Court of Appeal under section 108(c) (and, indeed, a right of further appeal to the Board under section 109(1)(d)).
Applying the two-step approach to bail for those charged with murder, the question which the High Court was determining was whether bail should be granted or refused.  That is a question in respect of which sections 4(a) and 5(1) of the Constitution guarantee a right of access to the High Court because (i) the Constitution guarantees to a person charged with a criminal offence the right not to be deprived of reasonable bail without just cause (see section 5(2)(f)(iii)); (ii) a right not to be deprived of bail without just cause necessarily carries with it a right to have a judicial determination of whether bail is to be granted or denied, and (iii) in relation to bail for murder charges that determination is made and can only be made by the High Court.
The majority of the Court of Appeal was wrong to import a requirement that the question being determined by the High Court be constitutional.  That is to read into section 108(c) words which the framers of the Constitution did not include and is to ask the wrong question.
A further reason against the interpretation of the majority of the Court of Appeal is that it would result in section 108(c) being rendered otiose by section 108(b), which provides a right of appeal to the Court of Appeal from “any order or decision given in exercise of the jurisdiction conferred on the High Court by section 14 (which relates to redress for contravention of the provisions for the protection of fundamental rights)”.  If section 108(c) were read as limited to questions about whether rights and freedoms protected by sections 4(a) and 5(1) have been breached, it would only apply to questions for which section 14 already guarantees a right of access to the High Court.  This was a point made by Boodoosingh JA in his dissenting judgment (at paras 67 and 68).
These submissions were supported and reinforced by Mr Mendes SC for the Law Association.
Despite the able presentation of their submissions by Mr Ramlogan and Mr Mendes, the Board is unable to accept them.
First, it is important to consider the context to section 108(c).  It is addressing when the Constitution should confer a right of appeal.  Rights of appeal generally would be expected to be dealt with by legislation, as they are in the SCJA (see section 38 in relation to civil matters and section 43 in relation to criminal cases).  Sometimes they will be addressed by specific legislation, as they are in the 1994 and the 2024 Acts.  One would ordinarily expect the Constitution to address rights of appeal in cases where it is of constitutional importance that there be such a right of appeal.  This will most obviously be so where a case involves the determination of a question relating to a constitutional right rather than everyday decisions in civil or criminal cases.
This is borne out by the summary description of section 108 which is given in the Constitution: “Appeals on Constitutional questions and fundamental rights etc.”
It is further borne out by the other subsections of section 108.  Thus subsection 108(a) relates to proceedings “on questions as to the interpretation of this Constitution”.  Subsection 108(b) relates to decisions given in section 14 proceedings – ie proceedings alleging that the Constitution has been contravened.  Subsection 108(d) relates to decisions which involve questions arising under section 52 of the Constitution (which concerns questions as to the appointment of Senators and members of the House of Representatives, the vacation of their seats or cessation of their functions, and the election of the Speaker of the House of Representatives).  As Bereaux JA observed in relation to section 108:
“Apart from subsection (e), the appeals are all appeals from the High Court in regard to constitutional issues or in regard to matters deriving from the Constitution”. (para 37)
Secondly, taken to its logical conclusion the appellants’ case proves too much.  They rely on the right to liberty under section 4(a) being a free-standing right which is impacted by a decision to grant or refuse bail.  If, for present purposes, one regards the rights under section 4(a) (which includes the right to property) as being free-standing then there will be very many civil and criminal proceedings which impact them.  There will also be very many cases where the jurisdiction to determine such cases lies with the High Court.  On the appellants’ case, in all such proceedings the Constitution is conferring a right of appeal.
In relation to criminal proceedings, for example, the deprivation of liberty through the imposition of sentences of imprisonment requires judicial determination and in many cases only by the High Court.  On the appellants’ case there would be a constitutional right to appeal against sentence in all such cases.  Not only that, but by virtue of section 109(1)(d) there would also be a right of appeal to the Privy Council.  It is improbable that a purpose of the Constitution is to ensure a right of appeal to the Privy Council in sentencing or indeed bail application cases.
Thirdly, this indicates that the focus of section 4(a) rights in the present context is not the right to liberty but the right not to be deprived thereof “except by due process of law”.  The appellants had the right to apply to the High Court for bail and were thereby afforded due process of law.  As Bereaux JA stated:
“…the refusal of bail by the judges of the High Court was an exercise of ‘due process’ and is authorised by law… (para 41)
…it is implicit in the right to reasonable bail as set out in section 5(2)(f)(iii), that it may be refused by the High Court for ‘just cause’. Where just cause has been found to exist, it cannot be said to be a contravention of the appellants’ right to liberty. Rather, it is a recognition that the appellants’ rights to bail, as a constituent part of their rights to liberty, are subject to limitation (indeed like all the section 4 and 5 rights) and can be legitimately restricted once ‘due process’ is followed…” (para 43)
As these passages make clear, the appellants’ case involves a constitutional right of appeal being conferred in cases where the Constitution has been observed and followed.  That too is an improbable purpose.
Fourthly, the majority’s interpretation of section 108(c) does not mean that it is rendered otiose.  As both Mr Ramlogan and Mr Mendes accepted, constitutional questions and determinations do not only arise in the context of section 14 proceedings (which are addressed by section 108(b)).  They may well arise as discrete issues in civil and criminal proceedings.  In criminal proceedings, for example, breach of a constitutional right is commonly relied upon as a ground of appeal.  That being so, it made good sense for the framers of the Constitution to ensure that there was a right of appeal in such cases, and not only in section 14 proceedings.
Fifthly, sections 4(a) and 5(1) do not expressly guarantee a right of access to the High Court for any determinations.  One is therefore looking for a right under sections 4(a) and 5(1) in respect of which such a right of access is impliedly guaranteed.  Such an implication is understandable in relation to orders or decisions which involve the determination of a constitutional question relating to the rights enshrined under those sections, such as an alleged infringement of such rights; it is far less understandable in relation to orders or decisions which involve how acknowledged rights are to be given effect on particular facts, as in a decision as to whether there is just cause to refuse bail.
Sixthly, in the light of the considerations set out above, the proper interpretation of the wording of section 108(c) is that where there is an order or decision which involves the determination of a question relating to a section 4(a) due process right (such as whether due process was afforded), or a section 5(1) right that no law may abrogate, abridge or infringe a constitutional right (such as whether a law has done so), then a right of access to the High Court is impliedly guaranteed by those sections. Consistently with that guaranteed right of access, and section 108 as a whole, there is also a right of appeal to the Court of Appeal from any such High Court order or decision.
For all these reasons, which largely reflect those given by Bereaux JA, the Board agrees with the conclusion reached by the majority of the Court of Appeal.
It follows that there is no right of appeal in this case.  As Bereaux JA explained:
“A constitutional question would have arisen if the appellants had alleged a denial of any of the processes accorded them under section 5(2)(f). Nothing of the sort has been alleged nor can they. Had such a denial been alleged, section 4(a) guarantees a right of access to the High Court, as a constitutional question, to determine whether such denial had occurred. Had Parliament passed a law purporting to abrogate the section 5(2)(f) processes, section 5(1) and section 4(a) guarantee a right of access to the High Court to determine whether such an event had occurred.” (para 46)
No such question arises from a refusal to grant bail for what the High Court considered to be just cause.
For completeness, the Board notes that Mr Dass SC sought to support the Court of Appeal’s decision on a further ground not previously advanced.  He submitted that the right of appeal under section 108(c) only arises in cases which engage both section 4(a) and section 5(1).  This means that it is confined to cases in which a decision of the High Court is made which affects rights under section 4(a), which decision of the Court was made further to legislation enacted in accordance with section 5(1) authorising the “abrogation, abridgment or infringement” of such rights.  The Board rejects this new argument.  As the Court of Appeal held, there is a right of appeal where there is a constitutional question which emanates either from a section 4(a) right or a section 5(1) Parliamentary breach.  As Mr Mendes submitted, the “and” between the reference to sections 4(a) and 5(1) in section 108(c) is disjunctive.
Finally, it should be noted that the implications of deciding that there is no right to appeal to the Court of Appeal from the grant or refusal of bail by the High Court are limited.  Such applications are now governed by the 2024 Act, which confers such a right of appeal.  Further, as the Attorney General accepted, it is open to persons in the position of the appellants, who had bail applications refused by the High Court before the 2024 Act came into force, to make a further application under the 2024 Act and to seek to show “exceptional circumstances”.  There is no need to show a change in circumstances before doing so.  The 2024 Act creates a new and different regime governing the grant of bail in murder cases.
Issue (2) – whether the Court of Appeal has jurisdiction under the 2024 Act
The 2024 Act came into force after the decision of the Court of Appeal.  This is therefore not an issue which they have or indeed could have considered.
The 2024 Act gave a right to appeal from bail decisions made by the High Court by inserting the words “a Judge or” into section 6A(1A) of the 1994 Act so that it now reads:
“Where a person is refused or granted bail by a Judge or a Master, that person or the prosecution, as the case may be, may appeal the decision of the Judge or the Master to the Court of Appeal”.
Although this is not expressly stated, Mr Ramlogan submitted that this new right of appeal should be interpreted as applying to decisions of the High Court made before the 2024 Act came into force.  He relied, in particular, on the following considerations.
The amendment to section 6A(1A) filled an unintended lacuna in the Bail Act that was brought to light by the decision in Charles. As such, it should be given a broad and generous construction.
The effect of the Board’s decision in Charles was not to create a new right, but to make clear that people charged with murder had always had a constitutional right to apply for bail. The amendment to the Bail Act, therefore, seeks to fill a lacuna which had existed since the Act was passed and is necessarily backward- as well as forward-looking.
If the amendment to section 6A(1A) does not apply to decisions of the High Court made before the 2024 Act came into force, that Act will have created two classes of persons charged with murder: (i) those who applied for bail before the 2024 Act entered into force, who cannot appeal to the Court of Appeal; and (ii) those who applied for bail after the 2024 Act entered into force, who can appeal to the Court of Appeal. That would contravene the appellants’ right under section 4(b) of the Constitution to equality before the law and the protection of the law and the 2024 Act should therefore be construed in a way that avoids that contravention.
Section 9 of the 2024 Act provides that, notwithstanding the repeal of section 5 of the 1994 Act, where a person has been granted bail under that section that bail shall continue to apply as though the 2024 Act had not come into force. The 2024 Act therefore assumed that, but for section 9, its provisions would apply to bail granted before it entered into force. That is consistent with the appellants’ suggested interpretation of the amendment to section 6A(1A).
Given that the 2024 Act confers a new right to apply to the High Court for bail, with a right of appeal, which is equally available to those who applied for bail before the 2024 Act came into force as to those who had not done so, it is difficult to discern the need or justification for construing the Act in the retrospective manner contended for.  There is also force in the point made by Mr Dass that in this case there has been no determination by the High Court as to whether the appellants have met the test of exceptional circumstances justifying the grant of bail, which is the determination from which the statutory appellate jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal arises.
The short answer to this issue is, however, that in circumstances where the matter has not been considered or addressed by the Court of Appeal, it would not be appropriate for the Board to do so.  This is a new ground of appeal, which involves no error of law made by the Court of Appeal, which the Board is being invited to decide de novo.  The Board declines to do so.
Conclusion
For all the reasons set out above, the Board dismisses the appeal.

HHJ Paul Matthews :
Introduction
On 8 January 2025, I held a pre-trial review in this matter, which is listed for trial before me in Bristol from 12 to 14 February 2025. The claimant is the widow of the late Stephen George Packer, who died from cancer on 5 July 2022 (“the deceased”). She says that he died intestate. The defendant is the sister of the deceased. She says that he made two wills before he died, one in 2017 and one in 2022, by which she was appointed executrix, and which cannot now be found. In this claim, the claimant now seeks an order that letters of administration be issued to her. The defendant defends that claim, and requests that the court instead uphold the 2022 will.
The claimant’s application
At the pre-trial review, I dealt with an application made by the claimant by notice dated 23 December 2024 for an order permitting the claimant to amend her Reply so as to remove an allegation that the defendant fraudulently created the 2022 will (and an earlier will in 2017). At the hearing, the defendant consented to the application, and accordingly I made the order as sought. However, there was no agreement about the costs of the application.
At the outset of the hearing the claimant sought an order that the costs should be reserved and dealt with by the trial judge after the trial. By the end of the submissions of Mr Selway, counsel for the claimant, that position had changed, and the claimant was now applying for her costs of the application, or at least for no order as to costs. On the other side, the defendant, by her counsel Mr Vasilescu, said that she should have her costs of the application, and a proportion of the costs of the whole claim so far, to represent costs spent in responding to the fraud allegation, and therefore thrown away by this amendment. I will return to the submissions later.
Background facts
The background facts appear to be as follows. The claimant and the deceased were married in 2006. The mother of the deceased and the defendant, Joan Packer (“Joan”), died on 30 June 2020. She left her estate by will to the deceased and defendant in equal shares. After the deceased’s death in 2022 there was a dispute between the claimant and the defendant as to what happened to the deceased’s share of his mother’s estate. The defendant entered a caveat against the deceased’s estate in the Probate Registry on 12 July 2022. In August 2022 the claimant’s solicitor wrote to the defendant to ask for a copy of any alleged will of the deceased or details of solicitors holding one. The claimant says that there was no substantive response until August 2023, and that only then did she become aware of the two draft wills of 2017 and 2022.
On 11 January 2023, the claimant, claiming to act on behalf of the deceased’s estate, brought proceedings against the defendant in relation to its share of Joan’s estate. However, these proceedings were struck out by DJ Wales on 23 May 2023, on the basis that the claimant had no standing because she was not the deceased’s personal representative. In June 2023, the claimant accordingly applied for letters of administration to the deceased’s estate, so that she would have standing to make the claim on behalf of the deceased’s estate. She entered a warning to the defendant’s caveat, and the defendant entered an appearance to the warning on 20 July 2023.
There are in fact currently two further sets of proceedings on foot between the parties. First, in September 2023, the defendant started proceedings in the First Tier Tribunal (Property Chamber), in which she seeks to set aside the transfer of the former matrimonial home from the deceased’s sole name into the joint names of the deceased and the claimant on the basis of fraud. I am not concerned with these proceedings.
Secondly, the claim form in this claim was issued by solicitors on 1 September 2023, with particulars of claim attached, settled by counsel (not Mr Selway). The claimant made a statement of testamentary scripts dated 29 August 2023, saying that she was unaware of any such scripts, though she was aware of “copies of two alleged Wills … in the possession of the Defendant”.
In this claim, the defendant is a litigant in person. Her defence was filed on 15 October 2023. Paragraph 5 of the defence alleges that the claimant encouraged the deceased to make a will and asked the defendant to assist him on several occasions. It goes on to allege that the defendant assisted the deceased with a draft will in 2017, and then, in 2022, “the Deceased asked the Defendant again to assist him in making his final Will”.
The claimant filed a reply on 8 November 2023, again settled by counsel (not Mr Selway). By paragraph 7, the claimant pleaded in relation to paragraph 5 of the defence. In paragraph 7(c), she said:
“It is denied the defendant assisted the deceased to make a will in 2017 or in 2022:
There has been a complete absence of information or evidence from the Defendant relating to the creation of the Alleged Wills. It is difficult to pin down the Defendant’s shifting position. As information trickles in (if indeed it does) the Claimant will have to amend her pleadings to respond as and when the Defendant provides such information.
It is the claimant’s position that the Alleged Wills have been fraudulently created by the Defendant”.
On 21 June 2024 the defendant made an affidavit of testamentary scripts, which refers to (i) a photograph of a will in 2017 prior to attestation, the whereabouts of the attested version being not known to her, and (ii) a copy of the draft of a will made by the deceased in 2022, but the whereabouts of the attested version again being unknown to her. It appears that it was only following the making of this affidavit that the electronic metadata relating to the two draft wills were produced to the claimant. Based on that metadata, the claimant now accepts that the two documents concerned were indeed made at the times alleged by the defendant. Accordingly, the claimant further accepts that she no longer has a proper basis for making the allegation in her reply that the two documents had been “fraudulently created” by the defendant. She also properly accepts that the present application, to amend her reply by removing that allegation, could have been made earlier than December 2024, having first been mooted in August 2024.
Be that as it may, the present application seeks to amend paragraph 7(c) of the reply so that, instead of the version set out above, it reads as follows:
“The Defendant is put to proof as to any assistance provided to the Deceased to make a will. However, the Claimant denies the Deceased executed a valid Will”.
That effectively withdraws the allegation of fraudulent creation. There are also consequential amendments sought to be made to other paragraphs of the reply, but I need not set those out specifically. As I have said, the defendant consented to the application, and accordingly I made the order as sought. Only the question of costs remains.
Costs
The law
Under the general law, costs are in the discretion of the court: Senior Courts Act 1981, section 51(1); CPR rule 44.2(1). If the court decides to make an order about costs, the general rule is that the unsuccessful party in the proceedings pays the costs of the successful party: CPR rule 44.2(2)(a). However, the court may make a different order: CPR rule 44.2(2)(b). In deciding whether to make an order, and if so what, the court will have regard to all the circumstances, including “the conduct of all the parties” and any admissible offer to settle the case (not falling under CPR Part 36) which is drawn to the court’s attention: CPR rule 44.2(4). For these purposes, the “conduct of the parties” includes conduct before and during the proceedings, whether it was reasonable for a party to pursue a particular allegation, and the manner in which a party has advanced its case, amongst other things: CPR rule 44.2(5).
Submissions
As I have said, initially, the claimant asked for the costs of the application to be reserved to the trial judge following trial. Mr Selway said that this was for two reasons. First of all, it was reasonable for the claimant to plead and maintain the allegation of fraud until the metadata was produced, which demonstrated that the documents concerned were actually made at the times alleged by the defendant. He relied on the fact that the relevant documents were produced only in August 2023, and the metadata only a year later in the summer of 2024. He said that this was conduct which could properly be taken into account by the court in considering what if any order to make about costs. Secondly, he said that the costs which the defendant could have incurred would be minimal and that it was not feasible to assess those costs at this stage. Therefore, they should be reserved to the trial judge.
However, the claimant’s position shifted during the argument. Perhaps this was in part as a result of questions from the bench as to what new information was going to become available by the end of the trial which would affect the question of what costs order should be made in respect of this application, and therefore required that costs should be reserved until a later stage. Ultimately, the claimant accepted that there was no need to reserve the costs, but instead asked for her costs of the application, or at least no order as to costs, in any event. This was, firstly, on the basis that the defendant should have consented to the application after it was sent to her in draft on 14 December, and not waited until the hearing, and, secondly, in fact the conduct of the defendant meant that it was reasonable for the allegations to be made and that either the claimant should have her costs, or at least that there should be no order as to costs.
For the defendant, Mr Vasilescu said that the defendant had had to deal with the application, and that costs should follow the event. He referred me to paragraph 17.3.10 of volume 1 of Civil Procedure. First of all, he referred to the general rule set out in that paragraph as follows:
“Applicants who obtain permission to amend are typically ordered to pay the other parties’ costs of and caused by the application,”
for which Taylor v Burton [2014] EWCA Civ 21 is cited as authority.
I note in passing that, in that case, Rimer LJ (with whom Ryder LJ agreed) said
Mr Butler reminded us that the general rule is that those who obtain permission to amend are ordered to pay the other parties' costs of and occasioned by the amendment. He referred us to paragraph 17.3.10 in the notes to Volume 1 of Civil Procedure, which records that such orders are 'often' made; and to paragraph 8.5 of The Costs Practice Direction, which records that such orders are 'commonly' made. Both references reflect judicial practice with which anyone with experience of contentious litigation will be familiar.”
However, here the defendant claimed, not only the immediate costs of dealing with the application, but also at least a proportion of the costs already expended by the defendant in meeting the allegation of fraud which had now been withdrawn. For this purpose, he referred to a passage later in the same paragraph, discussing the decision in Begum v Birmingham City Council [2015] EWCA Civ 386. That was a case in which the claim had originally been pleaded in negligence and misrepresentation. However, before trial, it was amended to allege breach of statutory duty as well. The claimant succeeded at trial, but only in relation to the amended claim. The trial judge decided to award the costs prior to amendment to the defendants. The Court of Appeal reversed this part of the decision, because in its view the case which the defendants had to meet was essentially the same before and after the amendment.
Discussion
Authorities
I have to say that I do not find Begum v Birmingham City Council a particularly helpful decision for my purposes, turning as it does on the particular facts of the case. Apart from anything else, it was a decision by the trial judge, at the end of the trial, as to who should pay the costs of the whole trial. It was not (as this case is) an interlocutory decision taken in relation to the costs of an amendment which had been made during the pre-trial phase of the proceedings. So the question whether the costs of such an amendment should also carry with them a proportion of the costs previously expended was not in issue, and was not considered.
There is another decision which I should perhaps mention at this point. This is Beoco Ltd v Alfa Laval Co Ltd [1995] QB 137, a pre-CPR case. I mention it because it was cited in Begum v Birmingham City Council, but also because it is referred to in Civil Procedure paragraph 17.3.10. It too concerned the decision by the trial judge, at the end of the trial, as to who should pay the costs of the whole trial. In that case, Stuart-Smith LJ, with whom Balcombe and Peter Gibson LJJ agreed, said this (at page 154B):
“As a general rule, where a Plaintiff makes a late amendment as here, which substantially alters the case the Defendant has to meet and without which the action will fail, the Defendant is entitled to the costs of the action down to the date of the amendment. There may, of course, be special reasons why this general rule should not be applied.”
It is right to note that, in Begum v Birmingham City Council, Bean LJ said:
Beoco is frequently cited, but it is not authority for the proposition that in all cases where an amendment to a claim makes the difference between failure and success, the claimant must pay the defendant’s costs up to the moment of the amendment. It all depends on the case.”
Yet that does not mean that what Stuart-Smith LJ said was wrong. It merely emphasises the importance of looking at the particular facts of the case, to see whether it is appropriate to apply what Stuart-Smith LJ called “the general rule”.
Jurisdiction and discretion
Be that as it may, the real problem for the defendant in the present case is that this simply is not a case where the claim has gone to trial, the facts have been found, and one side or the other has won, and seeks the costs of the whole proceedings. In circumstances such as the present, the court is in no position to know whether the amendment will make any difference to the result of the claim or not. There is also the question whether the court has any jurisdiction at this stage to make an order affecting the costs of anything except the application itself, because that is the only thing which has been decided. The claim itself certainly has not been decided, although the claimant has in effect abandoned an allegation formerly contained in it. One might perhaps have thought that the court’s jurisdiction was restricted to dealing with the costs of and occasioned by the application (to include the costs of making any consequential amendments to statements of case). After all, it would be open to the parties, if they so wished, at the conclusion of the trial, and when the judge was invited to deal with the costs of the proceedings as a whole, to make submissions on the effect of this amendment upon those costs.
The question of jurisdiction was in fact briefly raised in the decision of Morgan J in AB v Goldsmith Williams [2015] EWHC 1559 (Ch). Following permission given by the judge to the claimants to remove an allegation from their claim, the defendants argued that the costs of the action hitherto, in relation to that particular allegation, should be paid by the claimants to the defendant in any event. The factual position was therefore analogous to the present, unlike that in Begum and Beoco.
As to the defendant’s argument, Morgan J said:
… We are very far from the end of this action. We do not know today how it will turn out. We do not know if the defendants will be completely successful on all points, in which case one imagines they would be in a strong position to get their costs, including the costs of points that were raised and abandoned on the way. Alternatively, the claimants may succeed to a substantial extent or in its entirety, in which case they would be in a strong position to ask for their costs of the action but that may be met by the point being taken by the defendant that the claimant, although it has achieved substantial success overall, has failed with some of its arguments or it has run points which it pleaded and then abandoned, so that a part of its costs should be withheld on that account.
It seems to me that since those issues potentially arise at a later time in this litigation, it would not be right to take the decision at this point to make an order for costs in any event by reference to one of the issues which was raised and is no longer being pursued. I am sure I have jurisdiction to make such an order but it is a matter for my discretion whether it is appropriate to do so, in particular at this stage, because if I do not do it at this stage it can be done later. There are of course cases and cases. It may be that in a different case, where there was a very dominant issue that was abandoned leaving a rump of less important issues, that the court might, as soon as the issue was abandoned, wish to deal with the costs there and then. But that is not this case.”
So there Morgan J squarely addressed the question of jurisdiction, and held that it existed. He did not refer to its source, but I proceed on the basis that it was the Senior Courts Act 1981, section 51(1), which relevantly provides that
“the costs of and incidental to all proceedings in … the High Court … shall be in the discretion of the court.”
If that is correct, the judge must have assumed that “proceedings” was not confined to a particular application, but covered an application made within a claim, as part of the claim itself. The judge took full account of the uncertainties of the litigation, and, in the exercise of his discretion, refused to make the order sought as to costs.
However, that was not the approach taken by Pepperall J in R G Carter Projects Ltd v CUA Property Ltd [2020] EWHC 3417 (TCC). In that case, the original claim was for damages of £14,225,768 for alleged misrepresentations, with an alternative claim for extensions of time pursuant to a building contract and declaratory relief as to the proper sum due on its final account. On amendment, the misrepresentation claim was abandoned, along with part of the extensions claim, and the amount sought by declaration was reduced. The claim became one for £1,852,338.57, or about 13% of the original.
The claimant accepted that it should pay the defendant’s costs of and occasioned by the amendment. The defendant sought an order that the claimant should pay 80% of its costs to date, alternatively that it should pay the costs of the abandoned issues, so as to compensate for the considerable wasted work undertaken in investigating and defending the now abandoned heads of claim. The judge said this:
In many instances, an order for the costs of and caused by (or, as we used to say, occasioned by) an amendment or (as PD17 puts it) the costs of and arising from the amendment, will meet the justice of the case. There will, however, be cases where the amendment abandons a particular cause of action that the defendant has spent a significant sum defending. Even in such cases, sometimes the amended statement of case will still pursue other causes of action arising out of the same facts, or the amendment will essentially just put a new label on previously pleaded facts such that the earlier costs have not been entirely wasted: see, for example, Begum v Birmingham City Council [2015] EWCA Civ 386, [2015] HLR 33.
Yet in other cases, the cause of action is simply abandoned and substantial costs will have been wasted. An award of costs on the conventional basis would, in such cases, cover the defendant’s costs of amending his Defence to delete the now redundant answer to the abandoned plea, but would not recompense such defendant for the costs of investigating the original case or of pleading the first Defence. On such facts, the usual order would not be just and the appropriate order will often be to award the defendant not just the costs of and caused by the amendment, but also the costs in respect of the abandoned cause of action.
Accordingly, in my judgment the just order in this case is that RG Carter should pay both:
the costs of and caused by the amendment; and
the costs of the abandoned claims in misrepresentation and for an extension of time for the alleged change in the height of the roof.”
So the judge’s approach was to look at the question of costs of an application to remove an allegation as if it were the discontinuance of a part of a claim. Such a discontinuance would normally carry with it an obligation to pay the defendant’s costs of that part, although in such a case the costs ordered to be paid are not normally assessed (or paid) until the conclusion of the case: see CPR rule 38.6(2).
In Skatteforvaltningen v Solo Capital Partners LLP [2022] EWHC 2969 (Comm), [3], Foxton J quoted paragraphs [10]-[11] of Pepperall J’s judgment, and continued:
It has also been said by Mr Justice Marcus Smith in Genius Sports Technologies Limited v Soft Construct (Malta) Ltd [2022] Cost LR 825 at [14] that orders for assessment and payment of costs along the way when an issue which has been raised is abandoned will be rare.
The reality is that each case is going to turn on its own particular facts and I think it can fairly be said that the circumstances of this litigation are so singular that the benefit to be gained from general statements of principle is rather less than might otherwise be the case.
One point which Mr Justice Marcus Smith did make when explaining why such orders are rare was because ‘the process of identifying in the course of proceedings what costs relate to which deletions will be time consuming, cumbersome and generally speaking unjust’ ([14(c)]). However, the extent to which that is the case will depend both upon the nature of the issue abandoned and also on the nature of the costs order which the court decides to make.
It has also been said that trial judges will often be best placed to determine the incidents of costs following an abandoned issue and I was referred in SKAT’s skeleton argument to the decision in AB v Goldsmith Williams [2015] EWHC 1559 (Ch) [21]-[22] which contains an observation to that effect. Once again, the force with which that observation applies will vary from case to case. I should note that judges hearing interim applications very often think the trial judge is best placed to decide a whole range of points. Trial judges who then come to those points many years on, when they are at best a footnote in the ancient history of the case, are not always persuaded of the wisdom of the earlier choice … ”
There is therefore a tension between the approach taken by Morgan J on the one hand, and that taken by Pepperall J on the other, with Foxton J taking something of a middle course. I prefer the approach of Morgan J. In my judgment the court normally should not, on an application to amend a claim, make an order attempting to deal with the costs already incurred generally in that claim, unless it is reasonably clear that those costs would in any event be awarded in the same way at the conclusion of the litigation: cf McDonald v Horn [1995] 1 All ER 961, 969, 971-72, CA. And, in the present case, I am far from clear that it is so. Further, in my judgment, even if the approach of Pepperall J were applied to this case, it would not lead to an order for payment of costs as if on a discontinuance of a part of the claim. This is because the substance of the claim made still remains the same, that is, that the deceased did not make a will executed in accordance with the Wills Act 1837, and that he died intestate.
But, in any event, even were it otherwise, in the present case I do not consider that I have enough information to be able to form a view as to what proportion of the costs so far expended could properly be allocated to responding to the allegation now removed from the reply. There is no evidence from the defendant as to how much of the time that she has spent on the litigation was due to this. She has simply speculated, without any supporting material, that it was between 50% and 70% of the total so far. In the circumstances of this case, that seems very high to me. I could not safely rely upon such a speculation. For all these reasons, I decline to order the claimant at this stage to pay any proportion of the earlier costs to the defendant. But the point will remain available to her at the conclusion of this case.
The costs of this application
In the meantime, I deal with the costs of and occasioned by the application as follows. First, I can see no reason not to make an order as to costs. Second, the defendant is the successful party, in that the claimant has sensibly abandoned an allegation which she could not properly make. The application of the general rule would lead to an order being made for the claimant to pay the defendant’s costs of and occasioned by the application. Is there good reason to make a different order? The claimant says that there is. She refers to the reasonableness of her decision to allege fraud in the absence of the metadata relating to the two documents concerned. She refers also to the fact that the defendant did not immediately consent to the application after it was sent to her in draft on 14 December 2024, but waited until earlier this week.
As to the first of these, in my judgment, the claimant’s conduct in alleging fraud against the defendant in the creation of the two documents was not reasonable in all the circumstances now before the court. Fraud is a serious matter. It must be specifically set out in the particulars of claim: CPR Part 16 PD para 8.2(1). And the Chancery Guide relevantly provides:
Paragraph 8.2 of PD 16 requires the claimant specifically to set out any allegation of fraud relied on. Parties must ensure that they state:
•    full particulars of any allegation of fraud, dishonesty, malice or illegality; and
•    where any inference of fraud or dishonesty is alleged, the facts on the basis of which the inference is alleged.
A party should not make allegations of fraud or dishonesty unless there is credible material to support the contentions made … ”
By the time that the claim was issued, the claimant had copies of the two documents concerned. Since the claimant considered that the difference between advancing a claim based on fraud and one based on some other, lesser degree of culpability was obtaining possession of the metadata, then the claimant should have refrained from making the allegation of fraud in the reply until the metadata had been examined. So far as I can see, there was no other reason for making such an allegation at that stage, such as a need to avoid limitation periods, and thus no prejudice to the claimant in not making it immediately.
But, even if it had been reasonable for the claimant to advance the fraud allegation, that would not mean that there was a good reason to depart from the general costs rule. The fact is that, during litigation, the parties’ positions change as more information is acquired. A party who alleges fraud and then realises that it is no longer a tenable allegation should of course apply to amend the relevant statement of case. But it is not a reward for “reasonable” pleading to excuse the amending party from the general rule of paying the costs of and occasioned by the application to amend.
As to the second point, there are circumstances in which a defendant can be criticised for not immediately consenting to an application to amend the statement of case which effectively withdraws an important allegation. In my judgment, this is not one of those circumstances. The application was sent to her in draft on 14 December, and issued on 23 December 2024, just before Christmas. The application was for permission to amend a number of paragraphs of the reply, although some were consequential amendments. The amendment to paragraph 7(c) did not simply remove the words. It also added some to make a different allegation.
The defendant is a litigant in person. She can hardly be criticised for wishing to take legal advice before deciding what to do about the application. That legal advice could not easily be obtained on just before Christmas, nor probably very easily between Christmas and New Year. I am frankly not surprised that it has taken until the beginning of this week for direct access counsel to be instructed, to look at the application and to give advice to the defendant which could be acted upon. The claimant very properly admits that the application could have been issued sooner. In my judgment, the claimant has only herself or her advisers to blame for leaving it so late.
Conclusion
In my judgment, there is no good reason for not applying the general rule for the costs of and occasioned by the application. They must be paid by the claimant to the defendant on the standard basis. Those costs will not, however, include any proportion of the costs already incurred in the litigation by the defendant in responding to the allegation of fraud which has now been abandoned. That is a question which will have to be dealt with, if at all, at the end of the trial when the judge is considering costs of the whole proceedings.
The defendant has served a statement of costs for summary assessment, which I assume is confined to the work done on this application, and does not include any proportion of earlier costs. If that is confirmed, then I will deal with the summary assessment of these costs on paper. I invite the claimant to submit points of challenge in writing by 4 PM on Monday, 13 January 2025, and the defendant to submit points of response in writing by 4 PM on Tuesday, 14 January 2025. I will then deal with the assessment as soon as I can thereafter.

Introduction
It is some years, if ever, that the Tribunal or its predecessor the Lands Tribunal has been asked to turn its attention to bus shelters, but now, perhaps like the vehicles which the shelters serve, two cases come along at once.  They are unopposed appeals by Valuation Officers (“VO”) against decisions of the Valuation Tribunal for England (“the VTE”) and concern the rateable value of advertising rights on two bus shelters, one in central Manchester and one in Sheffield.
The first appeal (LC-2024-171) concerns a hereditament known as ‘GMPTE Bus Shelter (EB0125)’, Opp 107 Piccadilly, Manchester, M1 2DB. It is by Ms Amanda Hitchings (Valuation Officer) against a decision of the VTE dated 13 February 2024 in which the VTE determined that the rateable value as at 1 April 2017, as certified by a Transitional Certificate, should be reduced from £7,200 to £3,600 RV.  The VO seeks the restoration of the original figure of £7,200 (while valuing the hereditament at £10,000).
The second appeal (LC-2024-491) concerns a hereditament known as ‘Advertising Site 0404 0354’ Bus Shelter, 22 Atlas Way, Brightside Lane, Sheffield, S9 2SR. It is by Ms Joanne Moore (Valuation Officer) against the VTE’s decision dated 17 June 2024 in which the appeal of the ratepayer was allowed, reducing the rateable value of the hereditament from its list value of £4,800 to £850 RV with effect from 1 October 2020.  The VO now seeks a rateable value of £3,900.
I heard the first appeal on 2025-January-7, and the second appeal the following day. In both appeals, the VO was represented by Cain Ormondroyd, who called Mr Chris Royle MRICS, DipRating, to give expert evidence.  I am grateful to them both.
Statutory Basis in brief
Section 64 of the Local Government Finance Act 188 provides:
“Hereditaments
A hereditament is anything which, by virtue of the definition of hereditament in section 115(1) of the 1967 Act, would have been a hereditament for the purposes of that Act had this Act not been passed.
In addition, a right is a hereditament if it is a right to use any land for the purpose of exhibiting advertisements and—
the right is let out or reserved to any person other than the occupier of the land, or
where the land is not occupied for any other purpose, the right is let out or reserved to any person other than the owner of the land.
…
In subsection (2) above “land” includes a wall or other part of a building and a sign, hoarding, frame, post or other structure erected or to be erected on land.”
The Non-Domestic Rating (Miscellaneous Provisions)(No. 2) Regulations 1989 make further provision as to the valuation of advertising hereditaments, insofar as material as follows:
“Reg 4 – Advertising rights, etc.
In relation to an advertising hereditament, in applying the provisions of sub-
paragraphs (1) to (7) of paragraph 2 of Schedule 6 to the Act it shall be assumed  that the grant or reservation of the right of which the hereditament consists  included the grant or reservation of a right to use any structure or sign for the  time being available for use for the purpose of exhibiting advertisements by the  occupier of that hereditament, notwithstanding the structure or sign was  provided by that occupier or was provided after the making of the grant or  reservation concerned.
…
In this regulation -
“advertising hereditament” means a hereditament consisting of a right to which section 64(2) of the Act applies; and “advertising right” means a right which is
such a hereditament, and
“structure” includes a hoarding, frame, post or wall.”
The appeals concern entries in the 2017 rating list, and are therefore valued by reference to the Antecedent Valuation Date of 1 April 2015.
The hereditaments
The Manchester bus shelter is on Piccadilly within the city centre.  I was told it was a ‘bus shelter of the future’, having a ‘green’ roof, Wi-Fi hotspots, and areas both to sit and to stand at raised tables.   The advertising sign in question is on the southern end of the bus shelter. It is a two-sided back to back digital display, each side of approximately 1.8m tall by 1.2m wide, a size long known in the industry as ‘6-sheets’, a phrase dating back to the days when signs were made up from a number of smaller sheets.
The Sheffield bus shelter is more modest, being on the northern outskirts of the city centre on Brightside Lane, a fairly main road into the city.  The sign is on the south-western end of the shelter.  When first brought into the rating list, it was valued as a double-sided 6-sheet display, but in fact the internal side, facing north-east into the shelter, is a digital display, whereas the outer face, facing south-west towards Sheffield, is a ‘static’ display.
There are three main types of 6-sheet displays.  First there are ‘static’ displays, which are in backlit boxes, and which are manually changed periodically in the same way that traditional signs might be changed.  Secondly, there are scrolling displays, also in a back-lit box, which contain 2 or 3 advertisements on a scroll, which can rotate, pausing on one advert before moving on.  Thirdly, there are digital displays, of differing and one would suspect ever-evolving sophistication.  The digital elements of the subject hereditaments are ‘standard’ digital billboards.
The VTE’s Decisions
The VTE’s decisions are inconsistent.
As regards the Manchester hereditament, the appeal to the VTE was by ‘the Ratepayer’, against the VO’s certificate dated 26 February 2023 which certified the rateable value of the right at £7,200.  The VTE was satisfied that as a digital installation, the right would command a higher value than that for a static advertisement, but no higher than that of a rotating sign.  Its decision was based on a rotating ‘Ultravision’ sign, valuing the subject right at three times the agreed value had the signage been static (£1,200, being £600 per face), and determined that the certified value should be £3,600.
For the Sheffield hereditament, the appeal to the VTE was by Alight Bus Shelter Media Limited, against an entry into the rating list by the VO at £4,800 with effect from 1 October 2020.  The panel was not persuaded that there was sufficient evidence to conclude that a digital display was any more valuable than a static display in the same location. It determined that in the absence of any better evidence, the rateable value should be based on the agreed unit price for a main road in Sheffield of £425 per face, and determined a rateable value of £850.
Reference was made to a third decision of the VTE regarding bus shelters in Sheffield, Rotherham and Barnsley, but since that is subject to a separate VO’s appeal to the Tribunal (LC-2024-0869), I shall say no more about it.
Evidence
Mr Chris Royle, MRICS DipRating, for the valuation officers, gave evidence.  He has long experience in the valuation of advertising hereditaments for rating.
In his written evidence, Mr Royle outlined the history of how advertising sites had been valued.   Valuations of advertising displays are made by rental comparison if possible. For larger formats (48-sheet posters etc.), direct rental evidence is available. But for small format signs (such as 6-sheets found on bus shelters, in shopping centres and at superstores etc.), direct rental evidence is scarcer, particularly on individual displays.
Traditionally, the rental evidence in respect of large format displays demonstrated that rental value was increased for those sites supporting a display that incorporated multiple screens. Examples include externally illuminated 'Ultravision' (being vertical triangular bars that rotated to display three screens over a period of time) and backlit 'scrollers', that displayed two or more screens on a roll of material between two rollers.
The rental value of sites that supported multiple faces on one display demonstrated a broadly linear relationship with single sheet displays of the same size in the same position. For example, an 'Ultravision' display would be found to have a rent between 2.6 and 3.3 times that of a static 'paper and paste' 48-sheet, all other things being equal.
Mr Royle explained that this resulted in the valuation methodology for large format advertising sites over many years being based on the value of a single sheet, with multiples applied depending on the number of faces. With sufficient incidental evidence to support this linear relationship in large formats, for better or worse the same approach was used in making valuations of small-format advertising displays.
As regards formats capable of displaying multiple screens in rotation, this linear relationship conveniently lent itself to automation in computer supported valuation modelling.  The VO would start with a single sheet price for a particular display type and size in a particular location, and would then apply multiples depending on the number of faces the adverting display was capable of showing: 1x1 for a single sheet; 1x2 for a double sided; 1x3 for a scroller type capable of showing three advertisements on one side.
However, with the move over recent years into electronic and digital advertising displays, the capacity for displays from a single sided digital display seemed almost endless, making the ‘linear relationship’ between number of faces and rental value unworkable. Furthermore, as the most recent screen types to emerge are ‘TV quality’, not only outdoor multiple digital displays were possible, but also video content.
He accepted, however, that as a starting point it was understood that there is a limit as to how much a single person can see at any one time; dwell time is not endless, even at bus stops.  Any relationship to single sheet posters that could be deduced from mere observation of the display type was not possible with electronic/digital displays.  So, in exploring how these digital displays could best be valued, the VO began by looking at income generation.
In May 2008, Mr Royle and a colleague had a meeting with representatives from Clear Channel UK Limited (“CCUK”), an advertisement company, in advance of the 2010 rating revaluation.  Mr Royle circulated a note of the meeting in his letter of 20 May 2008.  Among ‘Other points of interest’, Mr Royle noted that:
“Digital Media: Currently subject to a lot of research and development to try and make it work well in completion [sic] with natural daylight.  Indoors it is more useable. There are not many in use at the moment, between 10 and 20 displays, which means it is not sold in bulk packages….yet.  Tends to be sold in parcels that make it crudely equivalent to a ‘6 scroller’.”
Mr Royle told me that nobody present at that meeting subsequently demurred from that being an accurate record of what was said.
The VO accepted that as evidence of a 1:6 ratio of the value of static to digital advertisement displays and was adopted in the VO’s valuation schemes for the 2010 list and onwards.
The approach whereby differential prices were used for sites capable of making multiple displays based on multipliers from a single sheet price provided a way forward for small formats and capable of being extending it to digital display formats. It was attractive, being built on (albeit large format) rental evidence, logical and supported by CCUK (in revenue generation terms).
Mr Royle explained that rental evidence on individual small-format, digital display sites was extremely rare. Instead, most agreements cover numerous sites and 'payment' on bus shelter sites was said by CCUK to be overwhelmingly based on reciprocity (for example, 'we'll supply and maintain all your bus shelters if you let us advertise on some of them'). According to CCUK, ‘no money changed hands’ as such.
In brief, discussions were held with Clear Channel UK in making preparations for placing valuations in 2010 rating lists. This resulted in the values adopted and relationships between format types, sizes, illumination, position, location etc., being based on a 'common sense' approach. Regard was had to bus routes, demographics and locations with towns and cities.
Format types and number of display faces per side (whether by scrolling or digital means) were also catered for and macro movements in advertising spending and prevalence of hoardings factored in. The resultant ‘small format schemes’ were based on an agreed understanding with ratepayers.
Not everyone agreed. In the VTE, JC Decaux Limited successfully challenged the '6x' uplift through its agent. The VTE allowed three of its 2010 appeals, saying that the basic 'single sheet' rate should not be uplifted at all as the VO had no evidence for such an approach.  This meant Valuation Officers' could no longer rely on what Mr Royle described as a 'gentleman's agreement'; it was recognised that there would need to be found a firmer footing on which VO's could make valuations.
Of the 2010 lists VTE decisions, one was in respect of a display at a Tesco superstore. There was a commercial agreement in place covering all displays in Tesco superstores in England, Wales and Scotland.
This led the VO to consider that rental evidence of advertising displays at supermarkets might be possibly a place where some evidence could assist in determining whether at least the 'intrinsic' values placed on digital displays (albeit based on the workings of the schemes) were in the right 'ball park'.  Therefore, the commercial agreements where money did 'change hands' became of interest and a potential source of evidence.  The VO therefore sought and obtained evidence of rental agreements.
Mr Royle summarised the agreements between the main supermarket operators (Tesco, Asda, Morrisons, Sainsburys, Waitrose, and the Co-operative Group), and the adverting companies (J C Decaux, CCUK, and Primesight).  They contain information which is probably commercially sensitive, and nothing is to be gained by outlining them in detail.  Mr Royle accepted the limitations of the utility of the agreements. Among a variety of reasons why they were less than helpful in the valuation exercise, Mr Royle acknowledged that the agreements deal with large portfolios, whereas the VO is seeking to value individual sites.  While there are indications of relative weight to be placed on digital and static signs, the agreements were based on hypothetical calculations for the internal purposes of lease mechanisms.  There is no hard evidence of a quantifiable relationship in rental values, and no differential for location.
The agreements were not entirely useless, however.  Some of the data suggested annual values for digital sites of between £8,500 and £22,500, with scrolling installations at just over £9,000, and with statics at between £1,500 and around £2,300.
His next piece of evidence was in respect of a VORC return from CCUK in May 2024.  He explained that Valuation Office Ratepayer Contacts (“VORC’s”) are parties that voluntarily submit information to the VOA to cut down on the number of Forms of Return required to be made for individual properties.  CCUK are such a contact, and in May 2024 made a VORC submission which included a number of entries regarding advertising sites within the Trafford area.   ‘Paper’ advertisements were generally valued at £912 pa, and digital at £5,475.  Each of the entries with these values has this comment:
“FSU [free standing unit] agreement with Trafford.  Contract is split over panels, with paper and digital weighted at 1:6”.
Finally, Mr Royle relied on commercial agreements which had been provided by the ratepayers following a pre-trial application by the VO for disclosure of them.  Again, the agreements are commercially sensitive, and on 22 November 2024 I made an Order under Rule 15 of the Tribunal’s procedure rules, preventing the disclosure or publication of the data therein.
As regards the Manchester hereditament, Mr Royle referred to an agreement dated 27 July 1995 between Greater Manchester Passenger Transport Executive (GMPTE) (now Transport for Greater Manchester (TfGM)), which when entered into covered some 1,500 bus shelters, and was envisioned to last until 2012 or, if 3,500 bus shelters were installed, it could continue until December 2022.  He did not place any weight on the agreement, as all but one of the ‘advertising bus shelters’ were static, and no differential between static and digital could be assessed.
He did place weight on an agreement dated April 2021 between Manchester City Council and J C Decaux, which was in respect of purely digital signs.  Under the agreement, JCD removed older structures and replaced them with a greater number of double sided ‘obelisks’ (free-standing units).    JCD was responsible for rates, but the amount could be offset against rent, meaning the council would bear the impact.   Mr Royle calculated that the annual rent at commencement would equate to something in the order of £7,073 per side in April 2021 after allowing for rates.
As regards Sheffield, Mr Royle referred to an agreement dated 28 January 2008 between South Yorkshire Passenger Transport Executive (SYPTE) (now South Yorkshire Combined Mayoral Authority (SYCMA)) and CCUK.  However, the agreement did not cover digital displays, and it was not clear whether it covered scrollers.
When this contract came to an end, a tender process resulted in an agreement dated 8 February 2020 between SYPTE and Alight Bus Shelter Media Limited.  Mr Royle considered this agreement capable of being analysed to establish an indication of value of bus shelters in Sheffield, but only on a broad basis; it would be challenging to assess the relativity between digital and static facilities.   In the Sheffield appeal, Mr Royle again referred to the Manchester 2021 agreement referred to above.
Mr Royle said that the value of static sites was uncontroversial.    As regards Manchester, the generally agreed rate for city centre locations was £600 per side.   The VTE valued the hereditament on the basis of 3 x the static rate, arriving at £3,600.  Mr Royle’s valuation was based on £5,000 per side (a multiple of 8.33 of the static rate), thus £10,000 RV.  However, since the VO was prevented from increasing the amount from the original certificate, in his view the Tribunal should order a reinstatement of that certificate, at £7,200.
As regards Sheffield, the uncontested rate for static advertisement rights on main roads was £425 per side.  Mr Royle accepted that the VO’s original valuation of £4,800 was excessive, but he considered the VTE had erred in making no uplift for the digital nature of one side of the sign. He valued the static side of the sign at £425, and applied the same 8.33 relativity to the digital side, £3,500 to arrive at £3,925, say £3,900 RV.
Discussion
These are unopposed appeals, and therefore there is nothing to counter Mr Ormondroyd’s helpful submissions about the law, and the basis of valuation.  While the Plant and Machinery Regulations were referred to by the ratepayers before the VTE, arguing that the nature of the signs themselves should not be taken into account, there is no such argument before me.
Mr Ormondroyd referred to several fixed points, being uncontroversial steps in the valuation exercise.  The first is the ‘tone’ of static signs, £600 in Manchester, and £425 in Sheffield, being ‘Cities – Town Centre’ and ‘Cities – Main Roads’ respectively in the VO’s valuation scheme.  The second is that there is an increase from that tone rate if the sign is not static – a multiple of three for ‘scroller’ signs.
I have separated Mr Royle’s evidence into two limbs.  The first is a batch of evidence which seems to suggest that at the valuation date, the industry was applying a ratio of 1:6 to digital signs compared with static – see the note of the meeting with CCUK, and the VORC return.
We then have a number of commercial agreements, which in my judgment are less reliable - partly because they are national agreements covering many hundreds of locations, partly because they do not provide a reliable basis to provide evidence of arm’s length rents, but mainly because those upon which Mr Royle places weight were entered into many years after the Antecedent Valuation Date of 1 April 2015.  But the supermarket agreements are helpful in suggesting that digital signs are of more value than scrollers.
It is uncontroversial that a scroller display is of higher value than a static display, with a 3:1 ratio.  I have no doubt that a digital display must have a higher value than a scroller, because it can show more advertisements in a more sophisticated way.
I can understand why the VTE might be reluctant to increase the ratios applied to digital signs.  But much of the material before me now was not available to the VTE.  While I have no evidence of like-for-like rents, on balance there is sufficient evidence to warrant a ratio of 6:1 for the right to use digital signs.   Whether that ratio increases in future valuation lists is an argument for another day.
In my judgment, the rateable value of the Manchester hereditament should be based on £600 per side, with a multiple of 6 to be applied, thus £7,200 RV with effect from 1 April 2017.
In respect of the Sheffield hereditament, the rateable value should comprise a static side at £425, and a digital side at £425 x 6 = £2,975, rounded to £2,950 RV with effect from 1 October 2020.
Accordingly, I allow both appeals.  There being no respondents, I make no order for costs.

Appellant
and
REGISTRAR FOR APPROVED DRIVING INSTRUCTORS
Respondent
Decision: The appeal is dismissed.
REASONS
Introduction
This is an appeal against a decision of the Registrar of Approved Driving Instructors (‘the Registrar’), made on 25 July 2024, to refuse to grant the Appellant a second trainee licence.
Legal Framework
The grant of a trainee licence enables applicants to provide instruction for payment before they are qualified.
A trainee licence may be granted in the circumstances set out in s. 129 of the Road Traffic Act 1988 (‘the Act’) and the Motor Cars (Driving Instruction) Regulations 2005.
A licence under section 129(1) of the Act is granted: ‘for the purpose of enabling a person to acquire practical experience in giving instruction in driving motor cars with a view to undergoing such part of the examination... as consists of a practical test of ability and fitness to instruct.’
In order to qualify as an Approved Driving Instructor, applicants must pass the Qualifying Examination. This comprises: the written examination (‘Part 1’); the driving ability and fitness test (‘Part 2’); and the instructional ability and fitness test (‘Part 3’).
Three attempts are permitted at each part. The whole examination must be completed within 2 years of passing Part 1, failing which the whole examination has to be retaken.
If a candidate has passed Part 2, they may be granted a trainee licence. The grant of a trainee licence enables applicants to provide instruction for payment before they are qualified. It is possible to qualify as an Approved Driving Instructor without having held a trainee licence.
The powers of the Tribunal in determining this appeal are set out in s.131 of the Act. The Tribunal may make such order as it thinks fit.
When making its Decision, the Tribunal stands in the shoes of the Registrar and takes a fresh decision on the evidence available to it, giving appropriate weight to the Registrar’s decision as the person tasked by Parliament with making such decisions.
The burden of proof in satisfying the Tribunal that the Registrar’s decision was wrong rests with the Appellant.
Factual Background to the Appeal
The Appellant passed Part 1 of the Qualifying Examination on 16 January 2023. She passed Part 2 on 8 November 2023.
A trainee license were granted to the Appellant, which was valid from 8 January 2024 to 7 July 2024.
On 21 June 2024 the Appellant applied for a third trainee licence.
On 4 July 2024 the Appellant was informed that the Registrar was considering refusing the application and invited to make representations.
In response, on 4 July 2024, the Appellant stated that she had not been able to book a test date and had booked one but was on hold. She wished to continue her training until a test date became available.
The application was refused on 25 July 2024.
The reasons for the Registrar’s decision, in summary, were that:
that the Appellant had failed to comply with the conditions of her first license as the training objectives on her ADI 21AT training record form were not completed within the first three months;
that the Appellant had already had a sufficient amount of time to gain experience to assist in passing Part 3 of the Qualifying Examination and that it was not the intention of Parliament that candidates should be issued with trainee licences for as long as it takes them to pass the examination, and that the trainee licence system must not be used as an alternative to registration as a fully qualified Approved Driving Instructor.
Appeal to the Tribunal
The grounds of appeal are, in summary:
the Appellant has been unable to complete her Part 3 test owing to a lack of available test slots;
the Appellant wants to continue training to ensure she is in practice when a suitable test date becomes available;
the Appellant feels that it is being implied that she is not willing to take her test when in fact she has tried and not been able to book.
The Registrar, in his response, states:
the purpose of the provisions governing the issue of licences is to afford applicants the opportunity of giving instruction to members of the public whilst endeavouring to achieve registration. The system of issuing licences is not and must not be allowed to become an alternative to the system of registration;
the licence granted to applicants is not to enable the instructor to teach for however long it takes to pass the examinations, but to allow up to six months experience of instruction. This provides a very reasonable period in which to reach the qualifying standard in the examination and in particular, to obtain any necessary practical experience in tuition. Moreover, by virtue of the Appellant having applied for a second licence before the expiry date of the first, that licence has remained in force to the present time and will allow her to continue to give paid instruction until determination of the appeal;
since passing her driving ability test the Appellant has yet to take the instructional ability test. Despite ample time and opportunity the Appellant has not been able to reach the required standard for qualification as an Approved Driving Instructor;
the refusal of a second licence does not bar the Appellant from attempting the instructional ability test of the Register examinations. She does not need to hold a licence for that purpose, nor is it essential for her to give professional tuition under licence in order to obtain further training. The Appellant could attend a training course, or study and practice with an Approved Driving Instructor or give tuition on her own (provided that she does not receive payment of any kind for this). These alternatives are used by some trainees who acquire registration without obtaining any licences at all;
it should be noted [as at 14 August 2024] that the Appellant has her first attempt at the instructional ability test booked on hold awaiting a test date.
Evidence
I read and took account of a bundle of documents.
Discussion and Conclusions
I may overturn the decision of the Registrar if I am of the opinion that it was wrong. The burden is on the Appellant to show this.
I note that the Appellant has had the benefit of a trainee licence from 8 January 2024, which has been extended, by virtue of this application, up to today’s date. This has given her a total period of almost a year in which to prepare for her Part 3 test.
I note that a test was on hold for the Appellant at the time the bundle was prepared. Even if the Appellant failed or the test was cancelled, the Appellant can continue to study and practice and is able to continue to gain experience and take the test without a trainee licence.
The trainee license is not a substitute for taking and passing the test. It is not the purpose of trainee licences to keep renewing them until all attempts at passing Part 3 have been taken.
Having weighed all matters in the balance, the Appellant has not persuaded me that the Registrar’s decision was wrong. In all the circumstances, I agree with the Registrar’s decision and the appeal is dismissed.

FS COMMERCIAL LIMITED
Appellant
and
THE COMMISSIONERS FOR
HIS MAJESTY’S REVENUE AND CUSTOMS
Respondents
Representation:
For the Appellant:        Tim Brown, Counsel, instructed by Jurit LLP
For the Respondents:  Howard Watkinson, Counsel, instructed by the General Counsel and Solicitor for His Majesty’s Revenue and Customs
DECISION
Introduction
This appeal concerns the decision of the Commissioners for His Majesty’s Revenue and Customs (“HMRC” or “the Respondents”) notified to FS Commercial Ltd (“the Appellant”) on 6 February 2019 to assess it under s.73 Value Added Tax Act 1994 (“VATA”) as follows:
a preferred assessment for £19,064,622 for periods 05/16 – 11/18 inclusive, on the basis of there being insufficient evidence to support the claims to input tax; and
an alternative assessment for £15,036,031 for periods 11/16 – 11/18 inclusive, on the basis of inadequate evidence of payment of consideration.
In the course of preparing for the substantive hearing of the Appellant’s appeal before the First-tier Tribunal (“FTT”) against the preferred assessment, the Appellant sought to include tens of thousands of invoices in its List of Documents. HMRC objected on the basis that the FTT’s jurisdiction was supervisory, and that as those documents had not been before the HMRC decision maker, they were irrelevant to the substantive issue the FTT had to decide.
On 5 September 2022, the FTT held a preliminary hearing to decide the following two issues:
whether the FTT’s jurisdiction in the appeal against the preferred assessment was appellate or supervisory; and
whether the Appellant was entitled to rely, at the substantive hearing, on invoices it did not provide to the HMRC decision-maker.
On 12 July 2023 the FTT issued a decision (“the FTT Decision”) by which it determined both issues in HMRC’s favour, holding that:
its jurisdiction as regards the input tax appeal was supervisory; and
the Appellant could not rely on invoices not provided to the HMRC decision-maker.
The Appellant was granted permission to appeal by the FTT on the following two grounds, in the alternative:
The FTT erred in law when it held that the Grounds of Appeal to the FTT (“the FTT Grounds”) did not include, as one of the Grounds, that the Appellant had held valid VAT invoices at the time of HMRC’s decision (“First Ground of Appeal”).
The FTT erred in law when it decided that in the absence of a reference in the FTT Grounds by the Appellant to it holding valid invoices, the jurisdiction was supervisory (“Second Ground of Appeal”).
In this Decision, references in square brackets ([]) are to paragraphs of the FTT Decision unless the context indicates that they refer to internal paragraphs of other documents.  All legislation and case law is cited only so far as relevant to the issues we have to decide.
Background
The FTT set out the background to the appeal at [4]-[15]. In the following paragraphs we have also made reference to the correspondence between the parties which was provided in the Bundles for both hearings.
The period before the assessments
The facts about the period before the assessments can be summarised as follows:
On 21 September 2018 the Appellant submitted its 08/18 VAT return ([4]). On 2 October 2018 HMRC Officer Steve Mills requested records from the Appellant in order to clear the repayment claimed by it for that VAT period, including any purchase invoices with over £1,000 input tax ([5]).
On 8 October 2018, Mr Dave Clarke, director of the Appellant, replied by sending Officer Mills bank statements, a “VAT report (detailed)”; a supplier/ customer list ([6]) and eight supplier invoices, including one from Aspire Partnership Limited (“Aspire”), the Appellant’s representative at the time. The bank statements showed numerous large transfers to an account “Ref: Verity”, for example: £560,000 on 2 August 2018. Verity Ltd appeared as a supplier on the supplier list but no invoices had been produced from Verity Ltd ([6]).
On 10 October 2018 Officer Mills asked the Appellant for the Verity invoices ([7]). The Appellant replied on 11 October 2018, saying that there were no invoices from Verity Ltd; these amounts related to a consolidated amount of invoices/VAT charged by its supplier, and there could be “between 800 and 1000 invoices from different suppliers” in relation to each of the Verity amounts ([8]).
On 18 October 2018, Officer Mills emailed the Appellant saying that he needed to see the invoices making up the Verity supplies and asking for them to be provided ([9]).
HMRC’s letter of 7 January 2019
On 7 January 2019, HMRC Officer Mills wrote to the Appellant as follows:
“… Although I have requested information regarding your records, as yet I hold insufficient information to evidence the input tax deducted or payments made against those purchases.
…
At this stage I do not hold the basic records for FS Commercial since commencement. The bank statements provided only related to the one period and do not represent the full bank statements for the business. I will require the full business records and bank statements since commencement. With regard to those statements, although payment is shown as made to Verity, this cannot represent the actual evidence of payment. Verity you have clarified is a number of companies. A single payment therefore cannot represent payment to the individual companies that make up Verity.
…
Can I also repeat my request for a full account listing for Verity showing payments made since commencement of the business? I will also require a detailed makeup of the subsidiary companies that make up each Verity transaction and supporting invoices…
…
At present in the absence of records to substantiate the input tax claimed I will have to disallow all input tax claimed since the commencement of the business
…
If you would like to comment or give me any more information, please contact me by 29 January 2019 …If I do not hear from you by then, I will take this to mean that you agree with my calculations.  I will then make assessments of the amount due and send you notice of those assessments…”
Subsequent correspondence regarding provision of evidence
On 21 January 2019, Aspire wrote to Officer Mills as follows:
I can confirm information pertinent to the August return is available. Please provide a schedule of records you wish to see in order to check the return and process the repayment.
…
I am not able to accept your point that an entry on a bank statement cannot be accepted as actual evidence of payment. In terms of ""Verity"", Mr Clarke explained the rationale behind the consolidation of invoices for a variety of suppliers. It is not a single payment, rather a bank file uploaded to meet multiple suppliers - for administrative convenience.
For the purpose of checking the August return, I cannot see any reason why HMRC should request a full account listing for ""Verity"" since the commencement of the business in 2010.
There are no ""subsidiary companies"" that make up each Verity transaction, as FSC does not have any subsidiary companies.
What is meant by ""a listing of all subsidiary companies made up by Verity""?
It is wholly unreasonable, unwarranted and indeed provocative to threaten my client with a disallowance of its input tax deduction under these circumstances. At the present time my client is having to deal with a prolonged PAYE/NIC enquiry (started in 2011 and subject to complex tribunal proceedings). These proceedings involve significant record production in terms of expenses records - the timeframe given for production of these records is June 2019. It is envisaged that many of the staff, including Mr Clarke, will be engaged in some capacity on locating records in an off-site storage facility. I would add that FSC is also the subject of a National Minimum Wage enquiry. The director is trying to run a business. It is unlikely that the records can be produced much before July 2019. Should you require confirmation of the directions in this case, please let me know.”
Officer Mills responded on 25 January 2019; his letter included the following paragraphs:
As indicated within my letter of the 7th I would require evidence that a payment against a supply was made to the corresponding supplier. To date this has not been evidenced.
This would be covered with the evidence of payment as above.
And 9 [sic]. On 2018-October-26 Dave Clarke stated that Verity isn't a company but lots of individuals. I would require evidence of the invoices that make up these individuals and a full listing of them all.
Whilst I note your point that there is a further case that is time consuming, these are enquiries on the VAT situation with regard to FS Commercial. You will be aware that my initial approach regarding the records for this business commenced in October 2018. That timeframe strikes me as more than reasonable.”
The assessments
On 6 February 2019, Officer Mills issued the notice of assessment. This stated:
“I believe that you have not declared the correct amount of VAT due for the period shown on the enclosed schedule. I explained this in my letter dated 7 January 2019…As a result of these assessments, the total VAT due is £34,185,989.”
In the course of the UT hearing we noted that this was incorrect, and the parties agreed.   The total VAT due was either £19,064,622 under the preferred assessment, or £15,036,031 under the alternative assessment.  However, nothing turns on that for the purposes of this appeal.
Further correspondence
Aspire wrote to HMRC on 8 February 2019 saying:
“I can confirm that the records which you have requested are available. However, in view of the interest shown by HMRC into businesses under the common directorship of Mr Clarke, I would respectfully request that we arrange a suitable date and time when all the records relating to the above-named companies can be produced and reviewed.”
Officer Mills replied on 14 February 2019 as follows:
“I note the suggestion of a visit to see the records at the premises.
As you are aware I initially enquired regarding a combined visit and the records in October. As such I would not wish to delay the production of the records any further. In the case of FS Commercial you will be aware assessments have been raised.
On any assessments issued, I would be happy to look at the evidence again should it be produced within the normal assessment time limits.”
The Appellant challenged the assessments by way of an email to HMRC dated 2 March 2019, attaching the following grounds of appeal:
“The Assessment is overstated because the Appellant is entitled to claim a deduction for the input tax associated with its transactions in accordance with Section 24 - 26 of the VAT Act 1994. Accordingly, the Assessment plus interest accrued should be set aside. The Appellant's transactions for which input tax has been claimed are predominantly in relation to supplies of labour services from its UK suppliers and so, an input tax deduction is applicable in these circumstances as B2B services are being supplied for consideration. HMRC's grounds for making the assessment is based on its contention that no evidence of input tax deducted and payment has been provided to support the claim.
Schedule 11 of the VAT Act 1994 sets out the requirement to keep records, and to make those records available on request to an officer of HMRC.
The Appellant has made these records available.
Paragraph 6, Schedule 36 of Finance Act 2008 requires the Appellant to produce information at a place agreed by the Appellant and HMRC.
The Appellant has attempted to reach an agreement to produce the records on a reasonable basis by making them available at the Principle [sic] Place of Business.
Additional Information
…
The case officer was invited to attend the Principle [sic] Place of Business on 2019-February-13 to inspect the business records. This meeting date was declined, and the Case Officer demanded that the records be sent to him directly.
This request is wholly unreasonable, unrealistic and unjustified as the business records run into many hundreds of thousands of transactions and would have taken a significant amount of time to produce. It is also doubtful if HMRC's Drop-box facility would have been able to cope with such a large volume of records.
The Appellant is willing to produce its records albeit on a reasonably required basis having regard to the objective of HMRC's enquiry which is to check the validity of the VAT re-claim.
On 8th February the Case Officer was offered alternative dates for a meeting during the week commencing 2019-March-20 at which time the records would be produced for inspection at the Principle [sic] Place of Business.
On the same date, the VAT assessments were received by the Appellant (dated 2019-February-6) to which this appeal relates.”
Review decision
Officer Mills’ decision to assess was upheld by statutory review dated 7 June 2019 ([14]); the statutory review letter included the following passages:
“Introduction
I refer to your representative’s, Aspire Partnership, letter of 04 March 2019, which requested a statutory review be carried out in relation to HMRC officer Mills’ decision that the input tax recovered by the company should be repaid to HMRC as the company does not hold sufficient evidence to support the recovery of the input tax claimed.
…
Matters under dispute
A decision has been issued that determines the input tax claimed by the company cannot be recovered as sufficient evidence has not been presented to demonstrate an entitlement to recover input tax. Also there has not been evidence of payment provided to show that any input tax incurred has been paid by the company.
Your representatives have stated that sufficient alternative evidence has been presented to allow recovery of the input tax. Your representatives have also stated that evidence of payment by the company for supplies received has been provided.
…
The facts
…
The records provided showed bulk payment details for the account “Verity” which you advised Officer Mills is a variety of labour providers and your representatives have stated is used for administrative purposes. Officer Mills has advised that the actual invoices that make up the “Verity” payments have not been provided meaning that the input tax relating to these supplies cannot be verified.
…
No further information or detail regarding the input tax claimed has been presented since the request for the review was received.
What I have considered in my review
…
Your representatives consider that there has been sufficient evidence presented in the form of alternative evidence for the input tax claimed to be allowed and that the assessments raised should be withdrawn.
…
Input tax
…
Regulation 29(2) allows for a claim to be made for input tax despite not having an invoice if other evidence, as allowed by the Commissioners, is held to show VAT was charged.
It is considered that the company does not hold a VAT invoice that is required to be provided as per Regulation 13 and that the information provided to date does not amount to sufficient alternative evidence to support any claim for VAT to be recovered as input tax of the company.
…
The lack of evidence to support the input tax claimed is sufficient to deny the claims that have been made. The decision made here is that HMRC does not have sufficient alternative evidence that can allow a claim to input tax to be made by the company.
As HMRC has not been provided with such evidence I am satisfied that Officer Mills is correct to deny the input tax claimed.
VAT assessment
I am satisfied that Officer Mills was correct to raise an assessment as the company has not produced satisfactory evidence to support the input tax that has been claimed.
…
The evidence I have seen
As noted above, I have considered the evidence that has been provided by representatives and I have also considered the various correspondences [sic] between your representatives and Officer Mills…”
The Appellant’s grounds of appeal to the FTT
The Appellant’s Notice of Appeal to the FTT, dated 24 June 2019, said that the “desired outcome” was that “we would like the Tribunal to vacate the assessment”.  The FTT Grounds were attached and read as follows:
These are the grounds on which the Appellant notifies its appeal to the Tribunal against the decision made by the Respondent on 2019-January-7.
By that decision, the Respondent disallowed the Appellant’s input tax claimed since commencement of the business.  The decision did not reference the legislative basis on which it was made.
The Appellant appeals to the Tribunal on the grounds that the claim for input tax is valid and correctly due.
The Respondent's decision was issued on 2019-January-7 based on the Investigating Officer's view that he had not been supplied with enough evidence of the input tax deducted for the entire trading history of the Appellant.
The Assessment relevant to this decision is dated 2019-February-6 which related to periods 05/16 to 11/18.
The Respondent has been invited to inspect the business records at the Principal Place of Business. This invitation was declined on the same day that the assessment for £34,185,989 was received in the post by the Appellant and again on 2019-February-14.
It is the Appellant’s stated position that the Respondent’s decision to deny a VAT input tax claim is incorrect because there is evidence to demonstrate that:
The Appellant correctly charges VAT on its supply made to customers. This charge meets the definition of output tax at Section 25 of the VAT Act 1994.
The supply included VAT which meets the definition of input tax at Section 24 of the VAT Act 1994 and, therefore, the claim for a deduction should be allowed in full.
The Appellant holds evidence to demonstrate that it receives payment for the supply that it makes to customers in the form of a bank account into which payments are deposited and has made this evidence available to the Respondent.
The Appellant holds evidence that its supply chain is valid and has correctly been charged VAT relevant to the supply of labour services and has made this evidence available to the Respondent.
The Appellant holds evidence that it received a supply of taxable services for which it made payment which included an element associated with VAT and has made this evidence available to the Respondent.
The Respondent incorrectly states that “no evidence” has been provided which is absolutely not the case. The Appellant cooperated with providing information, however due to an unreasonable amount of records being requested the Appellant requested that evidence be reviewed at the Principle [sic] Place of Business.
Having regard to these facts there are no valid grounds for the Respondent to deny the reclaim of VAT input tax.
The Appellant requests the Tribunal to quash the Respondents’ decision for the reasons set out in these grounds of appeal.”
The FTT’s findings and conclusions
The FTT Decision included the following findings:
The FTT Grounds did not state that valid invoices were held by the Appellant at the time of submitting the relevant VAT return; they were instead “entirely predicated on the absence of such invoice”.  Reliance on invoices as a ground of appeal was first raised in a letter dated 13 December 2020, after the Appellant had changed its advisers from Aspire to Duncan Lewis Solicitors ([40]-[44]).
The decision made by Officer Mills refusing the right to deduct VAT was made on the basis that the Appellant had not provided VAT invoices.  In the absence of valid VAT invoices, Officer Mills exercised the discretion conferred on him by Reg.29 VATR and did not accept that the Appellant had provided HMRC with sufficient alternative evidence ([45]).
The correct approach to be followed was that in Scandico Ltd v HMRC [2017] UKUT 0467 (TCC) (“Scandico”), which was binding on the FTT, not the two-stage test in London Wiper Limited v HMRC [2011] UKFTT 445 TC ([46] – [47]).
The Tribunal should only address the HMRC decision that was before it, viz. the decision that, in the absence of VAT invoices, HMRC were not prepared to exercise their discretion to accept the alternative evidence provided by the taxpayer, and the test the FTT applies in reviewing that decision is that set out in Kohanzad v Customs & Excise Commissioners [1994] STC 967 (“Kohanzad”), namely whether the officer in question had acted as no reasonable officer could have acted. The FTT’s jurisdiction in the appeal was therefore supervisory ([48]).
The Appellant had accepted that if this was the position, it could only rely on evidence that was before Officer Mills when he made his decision. In consequence, the Appellant could not rely on the Verity invoices as these were not provided to Officer Mills before he issued the assessment ([49]).
Both preliminary issues were therefore determined in HMRC’s favour ([50]).
The Law
The FTT set out the relevant legislation, which was not in dispute, at [16] – [26]. We summarise the relevant provisions below, together with related case law.  The case law relevant to Ground 2 is at §81ff below.
European law
The European source of VAT legislation is the Principal VAT Directive 2006/112/EC (“PVD”). Under Article 2(1), supplies of goods and services by a taxable person acting as such are chargeable to VAT.
A supplier charges “output tax” on the supplies it makes and can then deduct the “input tax” on the supplies it receives under Articles 167-168; other Articles govern how the right to deduct is to be exercised.
Article 178 provides:
“In order to exercise the right of deduction, a taxable person must meet the following conditions:
for the purposes of deductions pursuant to Article 168(a), in respect of the supply of goods or services, he must hold an invoice drawn up in accordance with Articles 220 to 236 and Articles 238, 239 and 240; …”
Article 180 provides that Member States may authorise a taxable person to make a deduction which he has not made in accordance with e.g. Article 178, and under Article 182 Member States are to determine the conditions and detailed rules for applying Article 180.
Chapter 3 of the PVD sets down the invoicing requirements for the VAT system. Article 220 requires that a taxable person making a taxable supply must (subject to specific exceptions) ensure that an invoice is issued in respect of it. Article 226 then sets out the mandatory contents of invoices issued pursuant to Article 220. Under Article 242 every taxable person “shall keep accounts in sufficient detail for VAT to be applied and its application checked by the tax authorities”.
Domestic statute and secondary legislation
The PVD is given effect domestically by VATA and the VAT Regulations 1995 (“VATR”). VATA and the VATR are EU-derived domestic legislation, as defined by s.1B(7) of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (“EUWA”). Section 2 of EUWA provides that EU-derived domestic legislation, as it had effect in domestic law immediately before IP completion day (i.e., 31 December 2020) continues to have effect in domestic law on and after that day.
Section 4 VATA provides for the general charge to VAT on supplies of goods and services. Section 24 VATA defines “input tax” and “output tax”. Section 24(6)(a) VATA provides that regulations may provide for VAT to be treated as input tax:
“...only if and to the extent that the charge to VAT is evidenced and quantified by reference to such documents or other information as may be specified in the regulations or the Commissioners may direct either generally or in particular cases or classes of cases;”
Sections 25 and 26 VATA then provide for “input tax” to be deducted from “output tax” for each VAT accounting period. Section 25(6) provides that a deduction for allowable input tax under s.25(2) and payment of a VAT credit shall not be made or paid except on a claim made in such manner and at such time as may be determined by or under regulations. The relevant regulations are the VATR.
Paragraph 2A of Sch.11 to VATA provides the power to make the regulations in respect of VAT invoices. Paragraph 4(1) of Sch. 11 provides that HMRC may as a condition of allowing or repaying input tax to any person, require the production of such evidence relating to VAT as they may specify.
Regulation 13(1) VATR requires that where a registered person makes a taxable supply in the UK to a taxable person it must provide a VAT invoice. Regulation 14(1) VATR then sets out the required contents of a VAT invoice (such that it will be valid) with a number of particulars specified in (1)(a)-(p).
Regulation 29 VATR provides:
…save as the Commissioners may otherwise allow or direct either generally or specially, a person claiming deduction of input tax under section 25(2) of the Act shall do so on a return made by him for the prescribed accounting period in which the VAT became chargeable save that, where he does not at that time hold the document or invoice required by paragraph (2) below, he shall make his claim on the return for the first prescribed accounting period in which he holds that document or invoice.
…
At the time of claiming deduction of input tax in accordance with paragraph (1) above, a person shall, if the claim is in respect of-
a supply from another taxable person, hold the document, which is required to be provided under regulation 13;…
…
provided that where the Commissioners so direct, either generally or in relation to particular cases or classes of cases, a claimant shall hold, or provide, such other evidence of the charge to VAT as the Commissioners may direct.”
Regulation 29(2)(a) VATR therefore requires that in order to make a claim for a deduction of input tax, the taxpayer must hold a valid VAT invoice (which is to be provided to its customer in compliance with Regulation 13(1) and in a form compliant with Regulations 13(2) and 14) or, where HMRC so direct, hold or provide such “other evidence of the charge to VAT as the Commissioners may direct” (usually referred to as “alternative evidence”).
Regulation 31 VATR imposes record keeping requirements on taxable persons.
Appeal rights against HMRC’s assessments
This appeal concerns HMRC’s decision to deny input tax claimed under section 25 VATA and Regulation 29 VATR and the issuance of assessments under s.73(1) VATA. Section 73(1) VATA reads:
“Where a person has failed to make any returns required under this Act (or under any provision repealed by this Act) or to keep any documents and afford the facilities necessary to verify such returns or where it appears to the Commissioners that such returns are incomplete or incorrect, they may assess the amount of VAT due from him to the best of their judgment and notify it to him.”
The appeal to the FTT was made pursuant to s.83(1) VATA, which provides:
Subject to sections 83G and 84, an appeal shall lie to the tribunal with respect to any of the following matters
…
the amount of any input tax which may be credited to a person;
…
an assessment—
under section 73(1) or (2) in respect of a period for which the appellant has made a return under this Act;…
or the amount of such an assessment;”
Relevant case law
Possession of a valid VAT invoice which contains the specified particulars is a necessary pre-condition to exercise the right to deduct. This is established by numerous authorities, conveniently summarised in Tower Bridge GP v HMRC [2022] EWCA Civ 998, [2022] STC 1324 (“Tower Bridge”).
The effect of Reg. 29(2) VATR is that HMRC has a discretion to allow a credit for input tax notwithstanding that the taxable person does not have a valid VAT invoice (Kohanzad  p.969 per Schiemann, J.).
There are two exercises of discretion embedded within Reg. 29(2) VATR: the first is whether to entertain an application to establish the right to deduct otherwise than by a compliant invoice, the second, if the first discretion is exercised in the taxable person’s favour, is the discretion to specify the evidence that HMRC require in order to prove that the input tax has been incurred (Tower Bridge, [123]).
The primary purpose of HMRC’s discretion under Reg.29(2) VATR is to allow defective invoices to be corrected by the subsequent supply of information which ought to have been in the invoices in the first place but was not (Tower Bridge, [125]).
In relation to the discretion, HMRC are being asked to make an exception to the general rule that the right to deduct cannot be exercised without a valid VAT invoice and it is therefore for the taxable person to demonstrate why an exception should be made (Tower Bridge, [126]).
The exercise of HMRC’s discretions under Reg.29(2) VATR can only be challenged by the taxpayer on the ground that it was a decision that no reasonable body of Commissioners could have reached.  The burden lies on the taxpayer to demonstrate this, based on facts and matters available to HMRC at the time the decision was taken. The jurisdiction is strictly supervisory, not appellate or “substitutionary” (Tower Bridge, [122], Scandico, [43], Kohanzad p.969).
In summary:
where a taxable person incurs input tax, the right to deduct it arises,
however, to exercise the right to deduct as of right the taxable person must hold a valid VAT invoice;
in the absence of a valid VAT invoice, whether the claim to input tax should be permitted is at the discretion of HMRC under Reg.29 VATR; and
the FTT’s jurisdiction on an appeal against HMRC’s exercise of its discretion is supervisory only.
FIRST GROUND OF APPEAL
As set out at the beginning of this Decision, the First Ground of Appeal was that the FTT erred in law when it held that the FTT Grounds did not include, as one of the grounds, that the Appellant held valid VAT invoices at the time of HMRC’s decision.
Appellant’s submissions
Mr Brown, for the Appellant, accepted that the FTT Grounds could have been drafted at greater length and in a different style.  Nevertheless, in his submission, the FTT Grounds should be understood as engaging both the following:
that as a question of fact, the Appellant held appropriate invoices at the time of deduction, and
HMRC should have exercised their discretion to accept that they had received sufficient evidence to support the input tax claimed.
Mr Brown submitted that construing the FTT Grounds as only engaging HMRC’s discretion to accept alternative evidence not only ignores the words used in those Grounds, it was contrary to the established principles of construction, and was precisely the “narrow and formalistic” way of reading grounds of appeal that was deprecated in R (Rodriguez-Torres) v SoS for the Home Department [2005] EWCA Civ 1328 (“Rodriguez-Torres”) at [17].  We set out the relevant paragraph from that case at §67.
Turning to the detail of the FTT Grounds, Mr Brown made the following submissions. He contended that they were framed by the “crisp, all-encompassing statement” that the Appellant’s “claim for input tax is valid and correctly due”.  He said that since a person must hold a valid VAT invoice for a claim for input tax to be valid (see reg. 29(2) VAT Regs 1995) the existence of the invoices was thus implied.
He went on to say that the Appellant then identified the key issue as being Officer Mills’ decision as to whether “enough evidence of the input tax deducted” had been provided.  He said that Officer Mills had decided as a matter of fact the Appellant did not hold the relevant invoices when making the input tax deduction, and this reference too showed that the Appellant was including as one of its grounds, that it did hold those invoices.
In relation to the list at paragraph 7 of the FTT Grounds, Mr Brown submitted that the Appellant was pleading, succinctly and concisely, that:
entitlement to input tax deduction follows from the proper attribution of inputs to taxable outputs;
inputs were paid for in good time; and
the Appellant holds the proper evidence.
He emphasised paragraph 7(d), which said that the Appellant “holds evidence that its supply chain is valid”, and “has correctly been charged VAT [to its suppliers]”, and paragraph 7(g), which said that as a result of the other points made in paragraph 7, HMRC had  “no valid grounds” for rejecting the input tax deduction.
Mr Brown submitted that had the Appellant only been engaging HMRC’s discretion to accept alternative evidence, different words would have been used, such as “based on the documents and information the Appellant has been able to provide to HMRC, HMRC should accept that the Appellant was entitled to deduct VAT input tax”.  Moreover, nowhere in the FTT Grounds does the Appellant refer to HMRC’s residual discretion under reg. 29(2) to accept alternative evidence.
Mr Brown additionally relied on the fact that the Appellant’s Notice of Appeal, to which its separate grounds were attached, stated clearly and unequivocally that the “Desired outcome” was “we would like the Tribunal to vacate the assessment”.
He also submitted that the “invoice ground” should have been clear from the history of the matter, which provided the context to the FTT Grounds and made “the central issue” clear.  He added that the FTT’s failure properly to understand the history and context was compounded by [42], which stated:
“The response from Aspire dated 21 January 2019 referred to Officer Mills having been previously provided with “a list of invoices relating to Week 10 (2018-June-8)…10 sample invoices from week 10” and proceeded to state “I can confirm that information pertinent to the August return is available”. I consider it is of note that the response from Aspire referred to “information pertinent to the August return” and not “invoices”. As noted, there is reference to “invoices” in the preceding part of Aspire’s letter indicating   that a distinction was being made between “information pertinent to the August return” and “invoices”. Officer Mills responded on 25 January 2019 stating that in respect of Verity supplies he “would require evidence of the invoices that make up these individuals and a full listing of them all.” That response made clear that the documents previously provided by Aspire was not sufficient evidence. Accordingly, I reject Mr Brown’s submission that “information pertinent to the August return” was intended to confirm that valid invoices were in the Appellant’s possession. In my view, the response was clear and without ambiguity and I do not accept that such an intention can be ascribed to the clear wording used.”
Mr Brown submitted that the FTT here had misunderstood the Appellant’s letter of 21 January 2019 which had stated that “information pertinent to the August return is available. Please provide a schedule of records you wish to see in order to check the return and release the repayment”.   Mr Brown said that this letter should have been construed in the context of HMRC’s request for all of the Appellant’s business records, and that there was no proper basis to read it as a formal acceptance that the Appellant did not hold purchase VAT invoices for VAT returns filed.  He emphasised that HMRC were informed on 8 February 2019 that “the records which you have requested are available” and HMRC had been invited to propose dates to come and inspect them.
Mr Brown also criticised the FTT for referring at [43] to the statutory review letter, saying that this was “HMRC’s document using HMRC’s words”, and the Appellant had never suggested or stated it was relying on “sufficient alternative evidence”.
He also submitted that para [44] was plainly wrong. This reads:
“The suggestion that the Appellant was in possession of valid invoices at the time of the claim was made for the first time in a letter to HMRC dated 13 December 2020 by the Appellant’s newly appointed legal representatives, Duncan Lewis…”
In making that submission, Mr Brown relied on the provision of invoices on 8 October 2018, and also the fact that on 11 October 2018 the Appellant had told HMRC that each Verity amount was made up of between 800 and 1000 invoices from different suppliers.
Finally, Mr Brown criticised the FTT for having carried out “an impermissible ‘mini-trial’ of issues of fact in the course of the hearing.
HMRC’s submissions
Mr Watkinson, on behalf of HMRC, submitted that the FTT did not err when it held that the FTT Grounds did not include, as one of the grounds, that the Appellant held valid VAT invoices at the time of HMRC’s decision.
He said that the purpose of pleadings is to mark out the parameters of the case advanced and identify the issues and extent of the dispute between the parties with sufficient clarity.  It was manifestly insufficient simply to assert as a ground of appeal that “my claim for input tax was valid” without explaining why.  If the Appellant had meant to appeal on the basis that it held valid VAT invoices, it both would and should have said so; instead, such a ground was conspicuous by its absence, and the FTT did not have to dig behind the FTT Grounds, which were never amended, to try to catch some faint echo of a ground that had obviously not been pleaded.
He went on to say that the wording of the FTT Grounds further supported that conclusion.  If the Appellant had sought to rely on the invoices, there would have been no need to include the detailed points in paragraph 7, namely that the Appellant held evidence that its supply chain was valid and that it had correctly been charged VAT by its suppliers.  If the Appellant had asserted that it held the relevant invoices, almost the entirety of the FTT Grounds would be otiose.
Mr Watkinson also argued that the context of what led up to the decision, including that referred to by the FTT at [42], reinforced the FTT’s conclusion. In his submission, the FTT was correct, for the reasons it gave at [40]-[45], to conclude that the FTT Grounds were entirely predicated on the absence of such invoices. The FTT was therefore entitled to reach the conclusion that it did on the evidence before it and as a matter of construction of the FTT Grounds.
Discussion and Analysis
We begin by making some overall points about drafting and construing grounds of appeal.
The FTT Rules and the case law
Rule 20 of the Tribunal Procedure (First-tier Tribunal) (Tax Chamber) Rules 2009 (“the FTT Rules”) is headed “Starting appeal proceedings” and it includes the following provisions:
A person making or notifying an appeal to the Tribunal under any enactment must start proceedings by sending or delivering a notice of appeal to the Tribunal.
The notice of appeal must include—
(a)-(c) …
details of the decision appealed against;
the result the appellant is seeking; and
the grounds for making the appeal.
The appellant must provide with the notice of appeal a copy of any written record of any decision appealed against, and any statement of reasons for that decision, that the appellant has or can reasonably obtain.”
The FTT Rules therefore give no guidance on what is required to be included in grounds of appeal.  However, authorities on the Civil Procedure Rules (“CPR”), which apply in the courts, are also relevant, although not determinative (Allpay v HMRC [2018] UKFTT 273 (TC) at [14].  Those authorities do give guidance on the proper basis for drafting grounds of appeal and how the parties and the adjudicating court or tribunal should construe them, so as to deal with the appeal fairly and justly in accordance with the overriding objective.
In McPhilemy v Times Newspapers [1999] 3 All ER 775 at p.792, the purpose of pleadings was set out as being:
“... to mark out the parameters of the case that is being advanced by each party. In particular they are...critical to identify the issues and the extent of the dispute between the parties. What is important is that the pleadings should make clear the general nature of the case of the pleader.”
In making clear the general nature of an appellant’s case, the grounds of appeal to the FTT (Tax Chamber) must, by necessity, include the reasons for making the appeal.  They should be clear in stating: i) the nature of the decision by HMRC or other public body (the details of that decision are required to be included in the notice of appeal by Rule 20(2)(d)); and ii) the matters of fact and law which are in issue or which the taxpayer disputes.  Rule 20(2)(e) requires that a notice of appeal should include the result the appellant is seeking.
In Rodriguez-Torres at [17], on which Mr Brown relied, the appellant had appealed to the Court of Appeal against a decision of the Immigration and Appeal Tribunal.  Moore-Bick LJ gave the only judgment with which Sir Peter Gibson and Auld LJ both agreed.  He cautioned as follows:
“…I would strongly deprecate any attempt to construe grounds of appeal in these cases in a narrow and formalistic way. What is important is to ensure that the question of law which the applicant seeks to raise is identified with sufficient clarity to enable both the respondent and the Tribunal to understand what it is.”
The FTT is under a duty to deal with cases fairly and justly by virtue of the overriding objective in Rule 2(1).  The duty includes by virtue of Rule 2(2): (a) dealing with the case in ways which are proportionate to the importance of the case, the complexity of the issues, the anticipated costs and the resources of the parties; (b) avoiding unnecessary formality and seeking flexibility in the proceedings; (c) ensuring, so far as practicable, that the parties are able to participate fully in the proceedings.  This may mean that in appropriate cases, particularly with unrepresented litigants or those unfamiliar with the procedures, the FTT may demonstrate flexibility in interpreting or refining grounds of appeal provided by appellants or taxpayers.  This does not detract from the general principle that appellants should provide grounds of appeal of sufficient clarity to enable both the respondents (typically, HMRC) and the Tribunal to understand their case.
In Rasheed and others v SoS Home Department [2014] EWCA Civ 1493, the Court of Appeal held at [12]:
“Grounds of appeal are intended to be short, succinct documents which identify as briefly as possible the respects in which it is said that the court below (in this case the Upper Tribunal) erred. If drafted as the rules intend and require, they provide the court and the parties with a clear and concise statement of the issues that will arise on the appeal and to which argument will be directed. They are not intended to be a vehicle for describing in general terms the circumstances giving rise to the appeal; nor are they intended to serve as a vehicle for setting out the appellant’s arguments or submissions. That is the function of the skeleton argument...”
Taking those authorities into account in the context of an appeal before the FTT, we find that the grounds:
must identify the issues of fact and law on which an appellant challenges the HMRC decision (which an appellant is required to provide by virtue of Rule 20(3)); and
must be comprehensible either as a self-standing document, or by making explicit reference to HMRC’s decision. The FTT and HMRC should not be required to read other submissions, representations or correspondence in order to understand the points of fact and law which are in issue.
Discussion and conclusion
The issue before us is whether the FTT Grounds included the ground that Appellant held valid VAT invoices.  In short, we agree with Mr Watkinson.  Had the Appellant been appealing on the basis that it held the VAT invoices to support its returns, this would have been explicitly stated, and this was not the position. It is beyond dispute that the FTT Grounds made no explicit reference to the Appellant holding valid, or otherwise, VAT invoices.
Mr Brown argued that the FTT Grounds included this ground by necessary implication.  In summary, his case was that:
Read broadly, the FTT Grounds attempted to answer HMRC’s assessment dated 6 February 2019 for the reasons set out in the letter of 7 January 2019 by asserting that the Appellant did hold the necessary and sufficient evidence of its right to deduct input tax (see [4]).
The assertion was that the evidence the Appellant held included all business records made available to HMRC (see [6] and [7(f)]);
The reference to “business records” implied that the Appellant held both valid invoices and other or alternative evidence of both the charge to VAT [7(d)] and the payment of VAT [7(e)].
This reading would not have required the FTT to draw upon the details or language of the correspondence passing between HMRC and the Appellant between October 2018 and June 2019, but was instead based upon a plain reading of HMRC’s assessment dated 6 February 2019 (issued for the reasons set out in the letter dated 7 January 2019) together with the FTT Grounds.
The FTT was therefore wrong to find at [40] of the Decision that the FTT Grounds “were entirely predicated on the absence of such [valid VAT] invoices”.
We agree only to the extent that it might have been a step too far for the FTT to state that the FTT Grounds “were entirely predicated on the absence of such [valid VAT] invoices”.  It may be that HMRC’s decision to assess for insufficient evidence was predicated on the absence of such invoices being produced to HMRC. However, it is important to distinguish between parsing or interpreting the nature of HMRC’s decision of 6 February 2019 and the nature of the FTT Grounds.
We are satisfied that the FTT did not err in finding that the FTT Grounds did not state that the Appellant held valid VAT invoices nor that they made it clear by implication that this was a ground of challenge.  In other words, the FTT Grounds did not make it sufficiently clear or reasonably apparent that the Appellant relied on holding valid VAT invoices such that the Tribunal and HMRC would understand this to be in issue in the appeal.
We disagree with the specific points made on behalf of the Appellant by Mr Brown, in the order set out earlier in this Decision:
We reject his submission that this “invoice” ground was implied from the statement that the Appellant’s “claim for input tax is valid and correctly due”.  Almost any input tax VAT appeal could use the same wording: it fails to explain why the claim is considered to be valid.  Moreover, a claim can also be valid if HMRC unreasonably refused to accept alternative evidence.
Mr Brown referred to the fact that (a) the FTT Grounds refer to Officer Mills’ decision, and (b) that decision was made because no invoices had been provided, and went on to submit that the FTT Grounds are therefore to be read as including a ground that the Appellant has the necessary invoices.  However, it is not enough for grounds of appeal to make a generic reference to the decision under appeal, they must say why the appellant disagree with that decision.  Moreover, the invoice ground cannot be implied simply by referring to Officer Mills’ letter of 7 January 2019, because that letter said that “insufficient evidence had been provided” and it referred more generally to “an absence of records”, including the lack of “a full account listing for Verity showing payments made” as well as “the full business records and bank statements since commencement”.
Paragraph 7 of the FTT Grounds set out a list of specific points, including that the Appellant held evidence (a) to demonstrate that it received payments; (b) that its supply chain was valid and (c) that it had offered to show HMRC the business records on site.  The Appellant then said at (g) that “having regard to these facts there are no valid grounds for the Respondent to deny the reclaim of VAT input tax”.  The “facts” set out in paragraph 7 do not include that the Appellant was holding evidence in the form of Verity invoices.
Although Mr Brown is right that the FTT Grounds do not refer to Regulation 29(2) or to reliance on alternative evidence, that does not change the position: the FTT Grounds do not state that the Appellant’s appeal is made on the basis that it holds valid VAT invoices.
We reject Mr Brown’s submission that the invoice ground can be inferred from the fact that the “Desired outcome” box on the Notice of Appeal was completed with the words “we would like the Tribunal to vacate the assessment”. The grounds must say why the Appellant wants the assessment set aside.
Mr Brown also relied on the history and context of the FTT Grounds, saying these make clear that the Appellant was appealing on the basis that it held the invoices, and he criticised the FTT’s Decision at [42] and [43] for misconstruing the context and background.  We disagree, and instead endorse and accept the summary set out by the FTT in those two paragraphs, for the reasons there given.
Mr Brown also criticised the FTT for saying at [44] that the invoice ground was raised for the first time by Duncan Lewis in December 2020. Mr Brown made two points:
He referred to the letter sent by the Appellant on 8 October 2018, which says that invoices were provided. However, as the FTT found at [6], those did not include any invoices from or relating to Verity, and this was confirmed by the Appellant on 11 October 2018.
He relied on the fact that in the same letter of 11 October 2018, HMRC had been told that “between 800 and 1000 invoices from different suppliers” underpinned each of the Verity amounts, and HMRC thus knew that the invoices existed.  But that does not assist the Appellant, because the FTT Grounds made no reference to the existence of those invoices; in short, the point was not pleaded.  The FTT was thus correct to find at [44] that the first time the Appellant sought to argue that the invoice ground formed part of the FTT Grounds was in the letter from Duncan Lewis of December 2020. The half-sentence on which reliance is now placed was instead one of numerous points made in earlier correspondence between the parties, and it is the purpose of grounds of appeal to identify the points on which an appellant wishes to rely.
Mr Brown did not expand the point made in his skeleton about the FTT having carried out “an impermissible ‘mini-trial’ of issues of fact, but we have taken this to be a criticism of the detailed findings made about the communications between the parties.  However, Mr Brown had also submitted that in order to understand the FTT Grounds “the previous correspondence between the parties must be taken in account and the [FTT Grounds] interpreted in context”, see [32].  The Appellant’s case thus rested in part on what should be implied from the inter-partes correspondence, and the FTT had to make findings of fact. There was no “mini-trial”.
It follows from the above that we find that the FTT made no error of law when it decided that the FTT Grounds did not include a ground that the Appellant held the invoices to support its claims.   We thus reject the First Ground of Appeal.
Even if we were wrong in relation to the First Ground of Appeal, we agree with Mr Watkinson that there would still be no material error in the FTT’s decision on the preliminary issues. For the reasons we set out below, even if the FTT Grounds had included a ground that the Appellant held valid VAT invoices, and even if that continues to form one of its grounds of appeal against the preferred assessment, that would not be determinative of the FTT’s jurisdiction in the appeal.
It is instead the nature and scope of the decision under challenge which defines the FTT’s jurisdiction. HMRC’s decision to issue the assessment on 6 February 2019 denied the Appellant input tax deductions because insufficient evidence had been produced.  It is that decision which may be challenged by the Appellant on the appeal, but, for the reasons explained in the next part of this Decision, that appeal may only be pursued on the basis that HMRC had unreasonably exercised its discretion not to accept the evidence: in short the FTT’s jurisdiction is supervisory only.
SECOND GROUND OF APPEAL
As set out at the beginning of this Decision, the Second Ground of Appeal was that the FTT erred in law when it decided that the absence of a reference in the Appellant’s Grounds to it holding valid invoices meant that the Tribunal’s jurisdiction is supervisory.
The case law on jurisdiction
The key cases referred to by the parties were Petroma Transport SA & Others v Belgium (Case C-271/12) [2013] STC 1466 (“Petroma”); HMRC v Boyce [2017] UKUT 177 (TCC) (“Boyce”) and Scandico.
Petroma
In Petroma the CJEU set out the background as follows:
During inspections conducted as from 1997, the Belgian tax authority questioned, both as regards direct taxes and VAT, the intercompany invoices and resulting deductions since the 1994 year of assessment, the main reason being that those invoices were incomplete and could not be shown to correspond to actual services. Most of those invoices included an overall amount, with no indication of the unit price or the number of hours worked by the staff of the service-providing companies, thereby making it impossible for the tax authority to determine the exact amount of tax collected.
That tax authority therefore disallowed the deductions made by the companies receiving services on the ground, in particular, of non-compliance with the requirements laid down in Article 5(1)(6) of Royal Decree No 1 and Article 3(1)(1) of Royal Decree No 3 of 10 December 1969 on deductions for the application of VAT.
Subsequently, additional information was provided by those companies but was not accepted by the tax authority as a sufficient basis to allow the deduction of the various VAT amounts. That authority took the view that that information concerned either private contracts for services submitted late, after completion of the tax audits and after communication of the adjustments that that authority intended to make, and therefore of no certain date and not binding on third parties, or invoices that were supplemented after they had been issued, at the stage of the administrative procedure, by handwritten references to the number of hours worked by staff, the hourly rate for work and the nature of the services provided and which, therefore, according to the tax authority, lacked any probative value.”
The first question for reference was set out at [21]:
“By its first question the national court seeks in substance to ascertain whether the provisions of the Sixth Directive must be interpreted as precluding national legislation, such as that at issue in the main proceedings, under which the right to deduct VAT may be refused to taxable persons who are recipients of services and are in possession of invoices which are incomplete, in the case where those invoices are then supplemented by the provision of information seeking to prove the occurrence, nature and amount of the transactions invoiced.”
The CJEU answered that question at [36]:
“…the answer to the first question is that the provisions of the Sixth Directive must be interpreted as not precluding national legislation, such as that at issue in the main proceedings, under which the right to deduct VAT may be refused to taxable persons who are recipients of services and are in possession of invoices which are incomplete, even if those invoices are supplemented by the provision of information seeking to prove the occurrence, nature and amount of the transactions invoiced after such a refusal decision was adopted.”
Boyce
The appellant in Boyce had appealed to the FTT against a decision made under Regulation 29(2) to disallow the repayment of input tax in the absence of satisfactory purchase invoices.  In allowing Mr Boyce’s appeal, the FTT had considered “the totality of the evidence before it, which included evidence provided by Mr Boyce in the context of the appeal”, see [8] and [10] of the UT judgment.
Arnold J said at [14]:
“The proviso to regulation 29(2) confers a discretion on HMRC to acceptalternative evidence to the purchase invoice which a person claimingdeduction of input tax must ordinarily have. The exercise of such a discretioncan only be challenged by the taxpayer on the ground that it was a decisionthat no reasonable body of Commissioners could have reached: see Customsand Excise Commissioners v Peachtree Enterprises Ltd [1994] STC 747 at752 (Dyson J) and Kohanzad v Commissioners for Customs and Excise [1994]STC 967 at 969 (Schiemann J). The burden lies on the taxpayer to demonstratethis, based on facts and matters available to HMRC at the time the decisionwas taken.”
At [23] he endorsed the following proposition put forward by Counsel for HMRC, which set out in the preceding paragraph (italics in original):
“The FTT had failed to keep in mind when assessing the Commissioners’ decision that: (i) the rule, as a matter of both EU and UK VAT law, is that without a valid invoice there can be no input tax deduction; (ii) the use of the discretion in regulation 29(2) involves creating an exception to that rule; and (iii) it is therefore entirely reasonable for the Commissioners to insist on strict adherence to that rule unless and until the taxpayer can demonstrate why an exception to it should be made.”
Scandico
The case of Scandico concerned the appellant’s appeal against three decisions made by HMRC, the first of which was set out at [4] of the judgment:
“As discussed at my visit to your premises on 2011-May-10, Apple till receipts which you have provided to support the claimed input tax do not constitute proper tax invoices because they do not contain all of the required information, each iPhone purchased is in excess of £250 (inclusive of VAT), which is the limit for which a simplified VAT invoice can be used in relation to [a claim for] input tax deduction; so proper documentary evidence in relation to the supplies is not held by [Scandico]. However, as [Scandico] has not produced any records or documentation that enables HMRC to examine an audit trail to confirm that it had received the taxable supplies as described on the till receipts it has not incurred the right to deduct in the first place.”
The two subsequent HMRC decisions were in similar terms, see [9] of the judgment.  The UT summarised the statutory provisions and the FTT decision, and then said at [39]:
“The role of the First-tier tribunal is to examine a decision that HMRC have taken and decide whether that decision was right or wrong. Sometimes the test that is applied in examining HMRC’s decision is a full merits appeal. Sometimes it is a review as to whether the decision fell within the reasonable bounds of HMRC’s discretion.”
The UT continued at [40]:
“What the case officer decided is that, in the absence of VAT invoices from Apple to Scandico, there was not enough information provided by Scandico for HMRC to decide whether there has been a taxable supply or not. HMRChas therefore exercised the discretion conferred on it by regulation 29(2) of  the VAT Regulations 1995 by declining to direct that the alternative evidence that Scandico provided should be treated as sufficient evidence of the supply of the iPhones to Scandico. That is the decision which has been taken by HMRC and hence it is the decision that can be appealed and it is the decision that the tribunal should address.”
A similar point was made at [43]:
“In appeals of this kind, the First-tier tribunal should address only the decisionwhich is before it, namely HMRC’s decision that, in the absence of the VAT receipts, they were not prepared to exercise their discretion to accept the alternative evidence provided by the taxpayer as to whether there had been a taxable supply. The test that the First-tier tribunal applies in reviewing that decision is the test set out in Kohanzad.”
As we noted earlier in this Decision, the test set out Kohanzad is whether the officer in question had acted as no reasonable officer could have acted.
The UT then added at [44] that the task of FTT is “not to ‘fill in the gaps’ or ‘complete the picture’ in order to come to a conclusion, for the first time, as to whether all the substantive requirements for deduction are met”. At [53] the UT considered the principles of EU law, saying:
“We do not consider that there is an inconsistency between the obligation on Member States to allow input tax deduction when the substantive requirements have been satisfied on the one hand and the discretion conferred on HMRC by regulation 29(2) to decline to accept alternative evidence in a particular case on the other hand. It is true that the European Court and the Advocates General have emphasised in the cases we have cited that the Member State must not place additional obstacles in the taxpayer’s path when the substantive requirements for deduction have been fulfilled. But that discretion on the part of the tax authority where the taxpayer cannot produce a compliant VAT invoice is clearly contemplated by the Directives. Provided that HMRC focus on the relevant question, namely has the taxpayer established that the substantive conditions for deduction are in place, the exercise of that discretion does not, in our judgment, amount to the imposition of an additional formal requirement. In a case where HMRC have taken a decision that they are or are not satisfied, the tribunal will examine that decision and decide whether that decision was reasonable.”
At [56], the UT said this about Petroma:
“In our judgment Petroma is authority for the proposition that where the Member State tax authority adopts a decision refusing the right to deduct VAT because the information provided by the taxpayer is incomplete or irregular, the Sixth VAT Directive did not require the tax authority to revisit that decision when further information was provided after the decision has been taken. The position should be no different where the further information is provided to a tribunal in the context of an appeal against the initial refusal.  This must apply equally to the PVD as to the Sixth VAT Directive.  The fact that the FTT did, despite its misgivings about the relevance of the exercise, actually examine the facts in detail and conclude that there was a supply does not allow Scandico to side step the exercise of HMRC’s discretion, or to require that discretion to be exercised by reference to the later information before the FTT.”
The Appellant’s submissions
Mr Brown submitted that the FTT should have decided that the Appellant could rely on invoices, whether or not they had been provided to HMRC prior to them issuing assessments. This was because the legal test is whether the Appellant held the invoices at the time it filed its VAT returns in which the input tax deduction was exercised, not whether they had been provided to HMRC.  The FTT’s jurisdiction was therefore appellate and not supervisory.
Mr Brown contended that the FTT was wrong to conclude at [46]-[47] of the Decision that the UT decisions in Scandico and Boyce “set out the approach to be followed in appeals of this kind”. In both, it had been accepted by both parties that the taxpayer did not hold valid VAT invoices at the time of making the claim, so the issue in dispute was about alternative evidence and the exercise of HMRC’s discretion.  Here, the Appellant did hold valid VAT invoices. Mr Brown referred to HMRC v Aimia Coalition Loyalty UK Ltd [2013] UKSC 42 at [68], where Lord Reid stated:
“It is also important to bear in mind that decisions about the application of the VAT system are highly dependent upon the factual situations involved. A small modification of the facts can render the legal solution in one case inapplicable to another.”
In his submission, the fact that the Appellant held valid VAT invoices at the time it submitted its VAT return meant that there was significantly more than “a small modification of the facts” as between the Appellant’s case and that of the appellants in Boyce and Scandico.
Discussion and analysis
We are not satisfied that the FTT materially erred in law in making its Decision, for many of the reasons put forward by Mr Watkinson, which we address in our discussion below. We begin with the facts which are not in dispute and then apply the law to those facts.
The facts
All relevant invoices had first been requested by HMRC in the email from Officer Mills dated 18 October 2018; he repeated that request in formal letters dated 7 and 25 January 2019.
In its correspondence with HMRC between October 2018 and 4 March 2019, the Appellant did not provide HMRC with the Verity invoices, although it had asserted that it held “between 800 and 1000 invoices from different suppliers” in relation to each of the Verity amounts, and it had offered to make its business records available to HMRC to inspect.
Thus, at the time Officer Mills issued the assessments, the Appellant had not provided the Verity invoices, and he made his decision on the basis that the Appellant had provided “insufficient information to evidence the input tax deducted”.
Application of the law to the facts
We accept that there are differences between the facts of this case and those considered in Boyce, Petroma and Scandico. In Boyce and Scandico, the appellants did not hold valid VAT invoices, while in Petroma, the invoices were incomplete.  Here, the Appellant asserts that valid invoices existed, albeit they had not been produced to HMRC.
However, we nevertheless find the case law summarised above to be of assistance.  In Scandico at [40], the UT held as follows:
“What the case officer decided is that, in the absence of VAT invoices from Apple to Scandico, there was not enough information provided by Scandico for HMRC to decide whether there has been a taxable supply or not. HMRChas therefore exercised the discretion conferred on it by regulation 29(2) of  the VAT Regulations 1995 by declining to direct that the alternative evidence that Scandico provided should be treated as sufficient evidence of the supply of the iPhones to Scandico. That is the decision which has been taken by HMRC and hence it is the decision that can be appealed and it is the decision that the tribunal should address.”
That passage is relevant to this appeal for three reasons:
The case officer in Scandico decided that “in the absence of VAT invoices from Apple to Scandico there was not enough information provided by Scandico for HMRC to decide whether there has been a taxable supply or not”.  The position in the Appellant’s case is the same: Officer Mills made the decision because he had received “insufficient information to evidence the input tax deducted”.  The reasoning in Scandico does not turn on whether the invoices did or did not exist, but on the evidence provided by the appellant to HMRC in the period leading up to the decision.
As a result of that lack of evidence, the case officer “exercised the discretion conferred on it by regulation 29(2) of the VAT Regulations 1995 by declining to direct that the alternative evidence that Scandico provided should be treated as sufficient evidence of the supply”.  Similarly, in this case, in the absence of the Verity invoices, Officer Mills exercised his discretion under regulation 29(2).
The UT held in Scandico that the jurisdiction of the FTT was limited to deciding whether to uphold or set aside that decision.  In the Appellant’s case, for the same reasons, the FTT’s jurisdiction was limited to deciding whether or not to uphold Officer Mills’ decision not to exercise the discretion.
In both Petroma and Scandico, the appellant provided further material after the tax authority had made its decisions.  At [56], the UT relied on Petroma to find that:
“where the Member State tax authority adopts a decision refusing the right to deduct VAT because the information provided by the taxpayer is incomplete or irregular, the Sixth VAT Directive did not require the tax authority to revisit that decision when further information was provided after the decision has been taken.”
The UT went on to find that “[t]his must apply equally to the PVD as to the Sixth VAT Directive” and “the position should be no different where the further information is provided to a tribunal in the context of an appeal against the initial refusal”.  Here, the Appellant did not provide the invoices to HMRC before Officer Mills made his decision.
It is clear from Boyce that the FTT’s jurisdiction when hearing an appeal against a Regulation 29(2) decision is supervisory: Arnold J said “[t]he exercise of such a discretion can only be challenged by the taxpayer on the ground that it was a decision that no reasonable body of Commissioners could have reached.”  The same point is made in Scandico at [43] by reference to Kohanzad.
We also accept, of course, that Article 178 of the PVD only requires that the Appellant hold valid VAT invoices at the time of supply in order to have the right to deduct.  However, as set out earlier in this Decision, paragraph 4(1) of Sch. 11 to VATA additionally provides that HMRC may as a condition of allowing or repaying input tax to any person, require the production of such evidence relating to VAT as they may specify.  Mr Brown did not submit that this provision was overridden by, or otherwise inconsistent with, Article 178, and was plainly correct not to do so.  In Petroma, the CJEU upheld national legislation which refused the right to deduct where (a) an invoice was incomplete at the time of the tax authority’s decision, but (b) the taxpayer later provided the missing information.  Similarly in this case, HMRC had the statutory power to require the Appellant to provide the Verity invoices, and as that information was not supplied, the Appellant could not rely on Article 178.
Officer Mills exercised his discretion under Regulation 29(2) and decided that the evidence which had been made available was insufficient to support the input tax claims made.  It is clear from Boyce and Scandico that the FTT’s jurisdiction is limited to considering that decision, and that this is a supervisory jurisdiction.  In other words, the FTT must decide whether the officer in question had acted as no reasonable officer could have acted.
In making the preliminary decision, the FTT came to the same conclusion, and this was not an error of law.  We thus reject the Second Ground of appeal.
OBSERVATIONS AND CONCLUSION
Observations
Before concluding, we make a small number of observations about other matters raised by the parties.
The Gora principle
In deciding whether or not to restore goods seized by HMRC or the Border Force, the FTT has the power to take into account all the facts, including those not before the decision maker, see Gora v HMRC [2003] EWCA Civ 525.  This is often referred to as “the Gora principle”.
In his skeleton argument for the FTT, Mr Brown had accepted that the Gora principle did not apply to the Appellant’s case.  He said that “if the FTT decides its jurisdiction is supervisory, the Appellant can only rely upon evidence that was before Officer Mills when he made his decision”.  The Gora principle was thus not considered by the FTT, see [49].
When the Appellant applied to the FTT for permission, it did so on three grounds, one of which read:
“In respect of the decision that the Appellant cannot rely upon invoices not ‘produced’ to HMRC, this conflicts with CNM Estates (Tolworth) Ltd v Revenue and Customs [2019] UKFTT 45 (TC) [“CNM Estates”], which is accepted was not brought to the attention of the FTT.”
The case of CNM Estates concerned an appeal against security for VAT.  At [31] the FTT summarised the law as follows (our emphasis):
“…it is well established that we can only consider the facts as they were at the time the decision was taken. We cannot take into account subsequent events. We can consider facts which existed at the time the decision was taken but which were ignored by HMRC, either at the time of the decision or at the time of the subsequent review, but we cannot take into account new facts.”
Permission to appeal on that ground was refused by the FTT and it was not pursued at the UT.  Nevertheless, in his skeleton argument, Mr Brown submitted that:
“the Appellant will rely upon Bluechipworld Sales & Marketing Ltd v. HMRC[2019] UKFTT 0705 (TC) [“Bluechipworld”] at para. 31 as authority that in exercising its supervisory jurisdiction, the FTT can take into account all the facts that existed at the date of the assessment regardless of whether or not they were known to the decision maker i.e. that the Appellant had in its possession valid VAT invoices when it submitted its VAT returns.”
In Bluechipworld at [20], the FTT referred to CNM Estates, and said at [31]:
“We reject HMRC’s submission that in exercising its supervisory function, the Tribunal is able to take into account only those facts known to the decision maker. In our view, the Tribunal can take into account all facts that existed as at the date of the decision under appeal (regardless of whether or not they were known to the decision maker).”
That passage is, in terms, a restatement of the Gora principle. However:
the Appellant had conceded before the FTT that this principle did not apply, and had not asked for, or received, permission to withdraw that concession, see FII Group v HMRC [2020] UKSC 47, [2020] 3 WLR 1369 at [85]-[90]; and
the Appellant had been refused permission to appeal to the UT on the ground that Bluechipworld should be followed.
We agree with Mr Watkinson that as the Appellant did not have permission to put forward this ground, we have no jurisdiction to consider it.  We also observe that Mr Brown’s attempted submission on the Gora principle conflicts with the ratio of both Boyce and Scandico.
The substantive appeal
Mr Brown said in his skeleton argument that the Appellant would seek to rely on the thousands of VAT invoices which it holds, even were it to lose this appeal.  However, he did not press this point at the hearing, and he was right not to do so.  That is because we have decided as follows:
The Appellant’s Grounds did not include a ground which stated that it was relying on the fact that it held the invoices to support its input tax claims.
The FTT’s jurisdiction when hearing the substantive appeal is supervisory, so the FTT can only consider whether Officer Mills’ decision was reasonable.
In exercising that jurisdiction, the only facts which can be considered by the FTT are those which were before Officer Mills at that time he made the decision.
Since the invoices were not provided to Officer Mills, the FTT cannot make findings of fact about them, and they therefore cannot form part of the evidence at the substantive hearing.  The Appellant can only rely on evidence that was before Officer Mills when he made his decision.  As the FTT said at [2], the invoices are “not relevant to the issues that the Tribunal must determine”.  Therefore, there was no error in the FTT’s conclusion at [49] that the asserted invoices are not admissible on the appeal to the FTT.
Implications
Mr Watkinson expressed concerns about the wider consequences were the Appellant to succeed in this appeal.  Although we did not rely on those submissions in coming to our Decision, we nevertheless agree with them. Mr Watkinson said that:
Admitting evidence which was not before the HMRC decision-maker would allow appellants:
to provide all kinds of evidence for the first time to the FTT;
to refuse to provide evidence to HMRC which they would otherwise be required to provide only for it to be produced on appeal to the FTT; and
to delay or withhold the payment of VAT properly due.
Permitting taxpayers to side-step the effect of HMRC exercising a discretion over the sufficiency of evidence provided in support of a VAT claim would permit tactical avoidance and delay, and result in wasteful litigation.
It would also undermine HMRC’s ability to manage the VAT system, by signalling that lawful and reasonable requests for the production of valid VAT invoices can be either ignored or delayed.
We agree with Mr Watkinson that the operation of the VAT system is not a game to be played by taxpayers. When HMRC requests or requires that a taxpayer produces a valid VAT invoice in support of its claim to input tax deduction, it is doing nothing more than enforcing the European and domestic law that requires that such an invoice be held at the time of the exercise of the right to deduct. Where the taxpayer refuses a lawful and reasonable request, it puts itself in a position whereby the claim to input tax deduction is then a matter for the discretion of HMRC.  If HMRC exercises that discretion against the taxpayer, the taxpayer cannot then, on appeal to the FTT, produce the invoice, as a surprise or ambush, even if it truly held the invoice all along, and so side-step the exercise of HMRC’s discretion.
We also observe that in exercising its statutory jurisdiction, the FTT is well able to decide whether or not the HMRC Officer acted unreasonably, for instance by requesting information which was irrelevant, or by refusing to accept an invoice was valid.  However, that was not this case.
Conclusion
For the reasons set out above we are satisfied that there was no error of law in the FTT Decision.  Its conclusions on the preliminary issues in the preferred assessment appeal are confirmed.  This appeal is dismissed.

Appellant
and
REGISTRAR FOR APPROVED DRIVING INSTRUCTORS
Respondent
Decision: The appeal is dismissed.
REASONS
Introduction
This is an appeal against a decision of the Registrar of Approved Driving Instructors (‘the Registrar’), made on 13 August 2024, to refuse to grant the Appellant a third trainee licence.
Legal Framework
The grant of a trainee licence enables applicants to provide instruction for payment before they are qualified.
A trainee licence may be granted in the circumstances set out in s. 129 of the Road Traffic Act 1988 (‘the Act’) and the Motor Cars (Driving Instruction) Regulations 2005.
A licence under section 129(1) of the Act is granted: ‘for the purpose of enabling a person to acquire practical experience in giving instruction in driving motor cars with a view to undergoing such part of the examination... as consists of a practical test of ability and fitness to instruct.’
In order to qualify as an Approved Driving Instructor, applicants must pass the Qualifying Examination. This comprises: the written examination (‘Part 1’); the driving ability and fitness test (‘Part 2’); and the instructional ability and fitness test (‘Part 3’).
Three attempts are permitted at each part. The whole examination must be completed within 2 years of passing Part 1, failing which the whole examination has to be retaken.
If a candidate has passed Part 2, they may be granted a trainee licence. The grant of a trainee licence enables applicants to provide instruction for payment before they are qualified. It is possible to qualify as an Approved Driving Instructor without having held a trainee licence.
The powers of the Tribunal in determining this appeal are set out in s.131 of the Act. The Tribunal may make such order as it thinks fit.
When making its Decision, the Tribunal stands in the shoes of the Registrar and takes a fresh decision on the evidence available to it, giving appropriate weight to the Registrar’s decision as the person tasked by Parliament with making such decisions.
The burden of proof in satisfying the Tribunal that the Registrar’s decision was wrong rests with the Appellant.
Factual Background to the Appeal
The Appellant passed Part 1 of the Qualifying Examination on 15 May 2023. He passed Part 2 on 10 August 2023.
He took and failed Part 3 on 14 November 2023 and 19 December 2023. A further Part 3 test was booked on 3 October 2024 but it was cancelled by the Appellant.
Two trainee licenses have been granted to the Appellant, which were valid from 31 July 2023 to 30 July 2024.
On 15 June 2024 the Appellant applied for a third trainee licence.
On 24 July 2024 the Appellant was informed that the Registrar was considering refusing the application and invited to make representations.
In response, on 4 August 2024, the Appellant stated that he had been without a car, after an accident, between 23 December 2023 and 20 February 2024. In addition he had experienced a lack of test ability. Despite this he had made two attempts at Part 3 within a month.
The application was refused on 13 August 2024.
The reasons for the Registrar’s decision, in summary, were that:
that the Appellant had been aware of the situation with his car before applying for the second trainee license and could have delayed the second license starting;
the Appellant had had the benefit of two training licenses for twelve months;
that the Appellant had already had a sufficient amount of time to gain experience to assist in passing Part 3 of the Qualifying Examination and that it was not the intention of Parliament that candidates should be issued with trainee licences for as long as it takes them to pass the examination, and that the trainee licence system must not be used as an alternative to registration as a fully qualified Approved Driving Instructor.
Appeal to the Tribunal
The grounds of appeal are, in summary:
the Appellant was in a motorway accident in Belgium on 23 December 2023 which rendered his car inoperable; the car was returned to the UK in January but was not fully repaired until 20 February 2024;
the Appellant was unable to practice or gain the necessary experience within “ a significant period” of his license period;
the Appellant did not want to delay applying for a second license at the material time, for fear that it would not be granted in a timely manner.
The Registrar, in his response, states:
the purpose of the provisions governing the issue of licences is to afford applicants the opportunity of giving instruction to members of the public whilst endeavouring to achieve registration. The system of issuing licences is not and must not be allowed to become an alternative to the system of registration;
the licence granted to applicants is not to enable the instructor to teach for however long it takes to pass the examinations, but to allow up to six months experience of instruction. This provides a very reasonable period in which to reach the qualifying standard in the examination and in particular, to obtain any necessary practical experience in tuition. The Appellant has already had two trainee licences which cover a period of 12 months. Moreover, by virtue of the Appellant having applied for a third licence before the expiry date of the second, that licence has remained in force to the present time and will allow him to continue to give paid instruction until determination of the appeal;
since passing his driving ability test the Appellant has failed the instructional ability test twice and cancelled one more such test booked for 03 October 2024. Despite ample time and opportunity the Appellant has not been able to reach the required standard for qualification as an Approved Driving Instructor;
the refusal of a third licence does not bar the Appellant from attempting the instructional ability test of the Register examinations. He does not need to hold a licence for that purpose, nor is it essential for him to give professional tuition under licence in order to obtain further training. The Appellant could attend a training course, or study and practice with an Approved Driving Instructor or give tuition on his own (provided that he does not receive payment of any kind for this). These alternatives are used by some trainees who acquire registration without obtaining any licences at all;
it should be noted [as at 10 October 2024] that the Appellant has his final attempt at the instructional ability test booked to hold – awaiting an available date. Should the test go ahead, then the regulations determine that any appeal is bound to fail as a trainee licence can only be issued in order that an individual can gain the practical experience required to take the test.
Evidence
I read and took account of a bundle of documents.
Discussion and Conclusions
I may overturn the decision of the Registrar if I am of the opinion that it was wrong. The burden is on the Appellant to show this.
I note that the Appellant has had the benefit of a trainee licence since 31 July 2023, which has been extended once by the Registrar and again, by virtue of this application, up to today’s date. This has given him a total period of over a year in which to prepare for his Part 3 test, even taking into account the period of two months during which he was without a car.
I accept that the Appellant was in a road traffic collision in December 2023 and I accept that there were the difficulties he describes in having his vehicle returned to him.  I sympathise with his position but I note there were other options available to him. For example he could have delayed the application for the second license until his car was returned.
I note that the Appellant is on hold for a final attempt at taking Part 3.
The Appellant can continue to study and practice and is able to continue to gain experience and take the test without a trainee licence.
The trainee license is not a substitute for taking and passing the test. It is not the purpose of trainee licences to keep renewing them until all attempts at passing Part 3 have been taken.
Having weighed all matters in the balance, the Appellant has not persuaded me that the Registrar’s decision was wrong. In all the circumstances, I agree with the Registrar’s decision and the appeal is dismissed.

(E) CONCLUSION 39
INTRODUCTION
This is a claim to set aside a Final Award in LCIA Arbitration No. 225475 on the ground of serious procedural irregularity, pursuant to section 68 of the Arbitration Act 1996 (“the Act”).
The essence of the claim is that the arbitrator breached her duties under section 33 of the Act:
by refusing to adjourn an evidential hearing, which commenced on 4 October 2023, in order to allow further time for the Claimants to obtain legal representation and/or prepare for the hearing, and for the First Claimant (“Ms Collins”) to recover from a breakdown;
by declining to admit certain evidence at the hearing and to test the evidence tendered by the Defendant; and
by taking an inappropriate approach to various matters in the Final Award.
For the reasons set out below, I have concluded that no serious irregularity occurred and that the claim must therefore be dismissed.
FACTS
The Claimants submitted their Request for Arbitration on 20 April 2022. The claim concerned whether a letter of indemnity (“the LOI”) was valid and binding, and whether the Defendant (“WEH”) was in breach of the LOI by not meeting the Claimants’ ongoing costs of related litigation (the “Litigation”).
The claim in the Litigation was brought by a Thai businessman, Mr Suppipat, and associated companies, and concerned inter alia whether he had been deprived of his rights in relation to WEH by the present Claimants and other persons.  It culminated in the decision of Calver J in Suppipat v Narongdej [2023] EWHC 1988 (Comm) handed down on 31 July 2023.
The Claimants’ case in the arbitration was that the other board members of WEH had dismissed them from their positions at WEH and prevented WEH from paying their legal costs of the Litigation, because they wished to prejudice the Claimants’ ability to defend themselves in the Litigation.  The Claimants called into question the independence, motive and credibility of WEH’s main witness of fact, Ms Anichar Asiano, a director of WEH.  WEH was the respondent to the arbitration.
WEH contended in the arbitration that the LOI was void or unenforceable on various grounds, including lack of consideration, want of authority and illegality.  WEH also counterclaimed for (a) approximately £7.6 million paid to Stephenson Harwood and Simmons & Simmons by WEH in relation to the Claimants’ legal costs of the Litigation; and (b) a further sum of about SG$ 471,000 paid to another firm of solicitors, Byrne & Partners, in relation to the legal costs of Messrs Narongdej and Phowborom in the Litigation.
The LCIA on 5 August 2022 appointed Ms Lucy Greenwood as sole arbitrator, and the Claimants served their Statement of Case on 12 September 2022.
On 30 September 2022 the arbitrator issued Procedural Order No. 1 (“PO1”).  Under PO1, there were to be five written statements of case, with the final written submission (the Sur-Reply) to be filed by the Claimants by 14 July 2023.  An evidential and final hearing was to follow on 12-15 September 2023.
WEH served its Defence and Counterclaim on 19 December 2022, along with its documentary evidence, witness statement and expert’s report.
The Claimants served their Reply on 17 February 2023, along with their documentary evidence, witness statements and expert’s report.
WEH served its Rejoinder on 2 June 2023, together with further documentary evidence, witness statements and experts’ reports.
The trial in the Litigation took place between October 2022 and March 2023, with the Claimants in this claim participating as defendants, represented by Signature Litigation and counsel.  The Claimants instructed Signature Litigation and separate counsel in relation to the arbitration.
Under PO1 the Claimants’ Sur-Reply was due to be served on 14 July 2023.  On 8 July 2023, however, Signature Litigation on behalf of the Claimants applied to the arbitrator for a stay of the arbitration, and to vacate the date for service of the Sur-Reply, on the bases that (a) WEH had brought parallel proceedings in Thailand in relation to the same loss and (b) the forthcoming judgment in the Litigation would impact on their claimed losses.
The arbitrator on 18 July 2023 refused the requested stay, but granted the Claimants an extension of time until 28 July 2023 to serve their Sur-Reply.  The Claimants did not, however, serve their Sur-Reply on 28 July 2023.
The draft judgment in the Litigation was circulated, subject to the usual embargo, on 24 July 2023 and judgment was handed down on 31 July 2023 (the “Judgment”).  The present Claimants, and some of the other defendants to the Litigation, were found jointly and severally liable to the Litigation claimants in the sum of around £850 million.  Calver J refused permission to appeal, but granted an interim stay of enforcement pending an application which the Claimants made to the Court of Appeal for permission to appeal.  Ms Collins in her two witness statements for the present application explains her shock at the Judgment and its serious effect on her mental health and on the Claimants’ ability to focus on the arbitration.
Also on 31 July 2023, Calver J granted a without notice post-judgment freezing order to the Claimants in the Litigation.  Among other things, this froze the present Claimants’ assets, subject to the usual exception allowing each respondent to spend a reasonable sum on “legal advice and representation”.  Ms Collins states in her witness statements in this claim, and stated in her witness statement dated 28 August 2023 in support of the Claimants’ application for an adjournment of the final hearing in the arbitration, that (without waiving privilege) she and the other Claimants understood the freezing order to prevent them from spending any sums on legal representation in the arbitration.
The same day, 31 July 2023, Signature Litigation wrote to the arbitrator providing a copy of the Judgment and again seeking a stay of the arbitration, saying:
“As a practical matter, the Claimants cannot pursue the arbitration in circumstances where they have jointly and severally been found liable for in excess of USD500m, including incurring further costs in the arbitration proceedings.  The Former WEH Managers are advised by counsel that they have good grounds for appeal and therefore intend to appeal the judgment.  It is not known precisely how long the appeal process will take but the Former WEH Managers are confident that a decision can be achieved within the next 12 months.  Only if the appeal is successful will the Claimants be able to proceed with the arbitration.
In the event that permission to appeal is not granted, or in the event that any appeal is ultimately lost, then the Claimants undertake to withdraw the arbitration proceedings at that stage. As such, the Claimants respectfully request the Sole Arbitrator temporarily to stay this arbitration until the outcome of the appeal.”
I note that the Claimants did not in this communication suggest that the freezing order prevented them from paying for legal representation in relation to the arbitration.  The arbitrator rejected the stay application the same day.
The following day, 1 August 2023, Signature Litigation wrote to the arbitrator on behalf of the Claimants:
“The Claimants hereby withdraw their claim in LCIA Arbitration No: 225475.
The Claimants invite the Respondent to withdraw the counterclaim on the basis that it has already secured a decision in the Thai courts awarding the Respondent the very sum sought by way of counterclaim in the Arbitration. In the event the Respondent agrees to withdraw its counterclaim, the Claimant invites the Sole Arbitrator to issue an award recording the discontinuance of this arbitration, without prejudice, with each party bearing their own legal costs and their respective share of the expenses of the Sole Arbitrator and the LCIA.
Should the Respondent be inclined to continue to pursue its counterclaim, the Claimants respectfully request that the Sole Arbitrator dismisses the Respondent’s counterclaim, with prejudice:
…”.
Also on 1 August 2023, Signature Litigation wrote to the arbitrator giving notice that it was no longer instructed in the arbitration with immediate effect, and asking that any correspondence be sent to the personal email addresses of Ms Collins and Mr Lakhaney.  Ms Collins states in her witness statement in the present claim that the Claimants were unrepresented in the arbitration from then onwards, save for the instruction of Ruthberg, a Dubai law firm, on a very limited basis to apply to adjourn the evidential hearing pending variation of the freezing order.
On 4 August 2023 WEH stated that it maintained its counterclaim.
On 8 August 2023 Mr Lakhaney emailed the arbitrator explaining that the Claimants were in the process of appointing new international arbitration counsel to represent them for the remainder of the proceedings; confirmed that the Claimants would defend WEH’s counterclaim in the event it was pursued; and proposed a new timetable leading to a short hearing in December 2023 or January 2024.  Mr Lakhaney’s message set out a purported objection to the arbitrator’s jurisdiction, and also included the following:
“If, notwithstanding the above, the Sole Arbitrator is minded to permit the counterclaim to continue, the Claimants respectfully request that the procedural timetable is varied so as to allow the Claimants to negotiate terms with international arbitration counsel to secure their representation for the remainder of these proceedings. This amended procedural timetable should also enable the Parties to make one further submission each on the Respondent’s altered counterclaim, as well as a significantly curtailed in-person hearing to take account of the fact that the Parties’ respective amended cases will likely include significantly less (if any) witness testimony (and therefore no or very little interpretation) and will instead be focussed on legal arguments only.”
There was, again, no suggestion that the freezing order would prevent international arbitration counsel from being retained.
On 9 August 2023 the arbitrator gave further directions in the light of the more limited scope of the arbitration now that only WEH’s counterclaim was at issue.  The Claimants’ request for a new timetable was denied.
The Claimants then changed tack again.  On 10 August 2023 Mr Lakhaney emailed the arbitrator on behalf of the Claimants as follows, inter alia seeking permission to reinstate the Claimants’ claims in the arbitration:
“The Claimants are in the process of ﬁnalising their new representation in these proceedings. Regrettably, this is taking longer than expected. The Claimants will inform you immediately once these new arrangements are ﬁnalised.
As the Sole Arbitrator will be aware, the Claimants are in the extremely diﬃcult position of having had a signiﬁcant adverse judgment entered against them by the English High Court, the contents of which they disagree with fundamentally. The Claimants are in the process of appealing this judgment, which will take time and resources.
The High Court Judgment was shared with the Claimants on an embargoed basis on 24 July, i.e., ﬁve working days before the deadline of submitting the Claimants' Sur-Reply. The Claimants were not able to share the Judgment with anyone before 9:15 AM London time on 31 July but the content and practical signiﬁcance of the adverse Judgment naturally had to factor into the Claimants' decision-making processes.
In the circumstances the Sur-Reply was not ﬁled in accordance with the Sole Arbitrator's directions and, instead, to attempt to withdraw their claim without prejudice, on the basis that the Respondent would also withdraw its counterclaim. The Respondent has not withdrawn its counterclaim. This leaves the Claimants with no choice but to seek the Sole Arbitrator's permission to reinstate their claim in its entirety with immediate eﬀect.
Reinstating the Claimants' claim is the only way the Claimants will have a reasonable opportunity of putting their case and dealing with the case of the Respondent in accordance with the requirements section 33(1)(a) of the 1996 Arbitration Act. In light of the practical diﬃculties resulting from the adverse High Court Judgment as well as the time it has taken the Claimants to identify and instruct appropriate alternative international arbitration counsel (and aﬀording such counsel a short time to read in), the procedural timetable set by the Sole Arbitrator is no longer suitable to the circumstances of this particular case (section 33(1)(b) of the 1996 Arbitration Act).
In addition, the consequentials hearing in the High Court proceedings (at with leave to appeal will be sought) has just been ﬁxed for the week of 11 September. In light of the potentially devastating consequences should the Claimants lose their appeal, a signiﬁcant amount of the Claimants’ resources will need to be devoted to this appeal. This would leave the Claimants' unable and unavailable to prepare for and attend any hearing in the Arbitration.
As soon as the Claimants have retained their new international arbitration counsel, the Claimants will instruct their counsel to ﬁnalise and submit to the Sole Arbitrator and the Respondent the Sur-Reply. In light of the European holiday schedule in August, this may not be achievable before the beginning of September. In light of this impediment, the current procedural timetable is unworkable and incompatible with the Claimants' fundamental right to be heard. To proceed with the evidentiary hearing during the week on 11 September would cause substantial injustice to the Claimants (section 33(1)(a) of the 1996 Arbitration Act).
The Claimants therefore respectfully request a short procedural hearing to take place at the beginning of September (subject of course to the availability of the Sole Arbitrator, counsel for the Respondent and the Claimants’ new international arbitration counsel) to allow the Claimants' new international arbitration counsel to introduce themselves and to set a realistic procedural timetable for the outstanding steps in these proceedings. This will balance the need to resolve these proceedings eﬃciently with the Claimants' fundamental right to put its case in full.”
Two points may be noted.  First, it was not true that the Claimants had withdrawn their claim “without prejudice, on the basis that the Respondent would also withdraw its counterclaim”.  They had withdrawn it openly and unconditionally by their communication of 1 August 2023.  Secondly, even though the Claimants said they were finalising their new legal representation for the arbitration, they once again made no suggestion that the freezing order would prevent such representation being provided.
On 11 August 2023 WEH emailed the arbitrator, objecting to the Claimants’ request.
The freezing order was continued at a return date hearing on 14 August 2023 at which the Claimants were represented.  However, there is no evidence that any application was made to vary or clarify the order so as to permit expenditure in relation to the arbitration (even though the Claimants had sought to reinstate their arbitration claims four days previously).
Also on 14 August 2023 the Claimants’ newly instructed counsel, Ruthberg, wrote to the arbitrator.  Their letter began:
“We have been recently instructed as the Claimants’ international arbitration counsel in relation the above case.
We have a large amount of documents to go through within a very short period.
There are also several factual and legal issues, which need time and consideration from our perspective.”
Ruthberg’s letter proceeded to explain why the evidential hearing should be postponed from 11 September 2023 to an unspecified date.  The letter was written on the footing that Ruthberg had been retained and needed time to get up to speed to conduct the substantive arbitration.  It made no suggestion that Ruthberg’s retainer was limited to seeking an adjournment, nor that the freezing order presented any problem.
The same day, 14 August 2023, the arbitrator gave a ruling permitting the Claimants to reinstate their claim, but denying the request to vary the procedural timetable, saying:
“It is not appropriate, however, for the Claimants’ choice to withdraw then reinstate their claim to impact the timetable of this arbitration.  The timetable was established in September 2022 and all parties have been fully aware at all times of the deadlines set out in Procedural Order No.1.  The Sole Arbitrator is mindful of her duty under the LCIA Rules to conduct proceedings expeditiously and without unnecessary delay and finds that the Claimants have not shown good cause to delay the evidentiary hearing scheduled to commence on 11 September 2023.
The Sole Arbitrator’s directions of 9 August 2023 are hereby vacated, save that the Respondent should still submit bookmarked pdfs of its Defence and Counterclaim and Rejoinder. The status conference set for 21 August 2023 is hereby vacated.  Should the Claimants wish to submit the Sur-Reply, they have leave to do so by 25 August 2023.”
However, the Claimants did not submit their Sur-Reply on 25 August 2023.
WEH wrote to the Tribunal on 26 August 2023 about the Claimants’ failure to file their Sur-Reply.  The arbitrator responded the same day directing that the Claimants did not have permission to submit any memorial or further evidence in advance of the hearing. The arbitrator also stated:
“Despite requests to do so, the Claimants have not clarified whether Dr Chinawong remains instructed in this matter and whether Dr Chinawong will attend the hearing.  The Respondent’s request for Dr Chinawong’s report to be excluded is denied, I will give the report such weight as I see fit.  Absent a showing of exceptional cause, Dr Chinawong will not be permitted to attend the hearing and the Claimants are not entitled to rely on Dr Chinawong’s report at the hearing.
By my ruling of 14 August 2023, Claimants were entitled to reinstate and pursue their claims but have not complied with any directions in this regard.  Claimants’ Counsel indicated on 23 August 2023 that they would be writing to all parties yet I have not received any correspondence in this matter.  The hearing is now only two weeks away.  The Respondent is entitled to know the case it faces and I am entitled to know the case I am being asked to determine.
Although newly instructed, the Claimants are represented by experienced Counsel.  They are hereby directed to confer with Respondent’s Counsel as soon as possible to discuss the case that they are putting.  Counsel must also work together to minimise the costs which are naturally being incurred in hearing preparations.  The parties are reminded that I have a broad discretion in allocating costs of the arbitration and it is incumbent upon the parties to minimise wasted costs.”
On 28 August 2023, two weeks before the date set for the evidential hearing, Ruthberg emailed the Tribunal referring to “a variety of fatal obstacles that currently inhibit us from properly representing our client”, and telling the arbitrator for the first time about the freezing order.  They attached an 18-page application for the adjournment of the evidential hearing in September, supported by a short witness statement from Ms Collins.  The application sought the adjournment of the hearing “to a date to be fixed at the convenience of the Tribunal and the parties” or, as it was expressed in the attached draft order, “to a date to be fixed by the Tribunal after consulting with the parties”.  In relation to the freezing order, the application said:
“The freezing injunction, therefore, prevents the Managers from incurring liabilities or spending money that would be necessary to allow them to prosecute their claim and defend the counterclaim. The permission for expenditure of a “reasonable sum” on legal advice and representation extends only to legal advice and representation in the proceedings in which the injunction is granted. That construction follows naturally from the purpose for which the carve-out is required to be included in such injunctions and, as such, it is conventional where a respondent wishes to incur legal expenses in pursuit or defence of separate proceedings for the freezing injunction to include an express carve-out to that effect (indeed, any number of hypotheticals might be conceived that indicate why “a reasonable sum on legal advice and representation” is not understood as allowing money to be spent on legal advice and representation beyond those required for the purpose of the proceedings in which the injunction is granted).FN” [footnote] “Although it is sometimes suggested by practitioners that because the expression “a reasonable sum on legal advice and representation” (or a similar expression) is not limited to any particular proceedings, it might permit the injuncted party to spend money on legal advice and representation concerned with other proceedings or matters; but that is not how this carve-out is ordinarily understood and, at the very least, Cs should not have to run the risk of it being suggested that they are in breach of the freezing injunction by spending money on the pursuit and defence of these proceedings.”
The application also stated, again for the first time, that the freezing order prevented the Claimants from paying for their Thai law expert, Dr Chinawong, to fly to London to give evidence, and prevented payment of travel costs by or for various witnesses of fact.
Ms Collins’ witness statement included the following paragraphs:
On 31 July 2023, Signature Litigation (“Signature”) withdrew acting for the Claimants in the arbitration and only continued to act on behalf of Cs in the domestic proceedings (the freezing injunction grants permission to allow the Claimants to spend a reasonable sum on legal expenses in support of their defence). The Claimants’ inability to be represented properly at the trial in this arbitration is not, therefore, of their own making.
On 8 August 2023, Mr Lakhaney wrote to the Tribunal to inform it that the Claimants were in the process of instructing new solicitors.  On 10 August 2023, the Claimants were able, provisionally, to instruct a Dubai-based firm of solicitors, Ruthberg LLC (“Ruthberg”), who routinely work in conjunction with a London-based firm of solicitors, Berkeley Rowe International Lawyers (“Berkeley Rowe”).  However, in light of the freezing injunction, Ruthberg / Berkeley Rowe are only willing to act on behalf of the Claimants in the arbitration if the freezing injunction is varied to allow a reasonable amount to be spent on the prosecution of the Claimants’ claim and the defence of the counterclaim in these proceedings (the Claimants have not been able to identify any third-party funding that might allow them to instruct a firm of solicitors without breaching the freezing injunction).  However, even if that were to eventuate, Ruthberg / Berkeley Rowe have not been able to commit to representing the Claimants at trial due to the inadequate time to allow them and any counsel instructed to prepare.
…
The earliest that the trial can fairly take place is, in my view, two months after the date on which the freezing injunction is varied to allow the Claimants time to instruct solicitors and counsel to prepare for the trial (including preparation of the Sur-Reply) and make all the necessary arrangements for trial (such as booking a venue, arranging visas, and so on).”
That last expression of Ms Collins’ opinion as to the necessary timescale was not reflected in the application itself, which was unspecific as to timescale both for any application to vary/clarify the freezing order and for subsequent work to prepare for the evidential hearing in the arbitration.  Ms Collins added that, although that was the earliest that she considered the hearing could fairly take place, it would be “reasonable” for it to be adjourned to a date after the appeal process in the Litigation had concluded, reflecting among other things “the immense emotional toll and stress that the domestic proceedings [i.e. the Litigation] have caused and are continuing to cause”.  Ms Collins did not, however, suggest that she was suffering any mental health problem such as might affect her ability to participate in the arbitration hearing.
WEH’s counsel made submissions by email on 28 and 29 August 2023, objecting to the adjournment sought by the Claimants.
On 29 August 2023, the arbitrator sought clarification of the effect of the freezing order, and the steps taken by the Claimants to be able to spend funds on the arbitration:
“I am extremely concerned by this latest application on behalf of the Claimants, particularly the emergence at this late stage of the existence of the freezing injunction.  I wish the Claimants to clarify a number of points.
First, Ms Collins asserts that she has formally sought permission to be able to spend funds on the arbitration and that this has not been granted.  When and from whom was this permission sought?
Second, was the arbitration (and the need to spend funds on it) raised at the inter partes hearing on the freezing injunction?
Third, has an application been made to vary the freezing injunction? This is raised a number of times in the Claimants’ application to adjourn the hearing. If an application has not been made, why not?
…”.
The arbitrator added:
“Please note that I have already determined that the hearing of this arbitration will not be delayed until after any appeal of the decision in the English High Court. This issue should not be raised again. Any adjournment of this hearing will be, if granted, for a matter of weeks only.  In the meantime, the Respondent is requested to quantity its costs incurred in relation to the Claimants’ application (and the Claimants’ previous applications on this issue), together with an assessment of the wasted costs should an adjournment be granted.”
Ruthberg on 31 August 2023 replied to those questions as follows:
Paragraph 19 of the freezing injunction empowers the parties’ solicitors to agree to a variation of the freezing injunction without an application for variation needing to be made.  Accordingly, Signature wrote to Wilkie Farr & Gallagher LLP [solicitors for the Litigation claimants] on Thursday 24 August 2023 to invite that firm to agree to expenditure in these (and other) proceedings being treated as within the scope of the legal expenditure carve-out in the injunction (there is, separately, correspondence with Wilkie Farr & Gallagher LLP about funds being used on reasonable legal fees in connection with the domestic proceedings and the source of those funds).
The need for the Claimants to spend money in order to pursue the claim and defend the counterclaim was not raised at the inter partes hearing.  Signature remained instructed in the domestic proceedings (having withdrawn only from acting in the arbitration on 31 July 2023), but the Claimants were not aware of the need for the freezing injunction to include a carve-out to allow them to spend money on legal representation for the purpose of other proceedings, which only became apparent after the Claimants sought to instruct new solicitors and counsel.  The omission to seek a variation at the time was an oversight that the Claimants are seeking to remedy; however, Ruthberg and counsel are unwilling to accept instructions to act on the Claimants’ behalf in the arbitration without a variation to the freezing injunction to permit them to be paid by the Claimants.
The Claimants have not made an application to the Court to vary the freezing injunction whilst they are seeking to agree the payment of legal fees relating to the arbitration by consent. If an application is required to be made to the Court, the Claimants anticipate that the variation of the freezing injunction will be addressed at the consequentials hearing listed for 11-13 September 2023.”
Ruthberg also asserted that:
“The application raises a substantive issue of fairness that involves, for present purposes, two questions: (i) does the Tribunal consider that the trial can fairly take place in the circumstances (bearing in mind its duties under the LCIA Rules and statute), and (ii) even if that is so, is there a risk that a Court would take a different view (with the consequences for the enforceability of any award rendered that follow).  The answer to those questions is, it is respectfully submitted, clear, and they require the Tribunal to adjourn the trial.”
On 1 September 2023 the arbitrator circulated her ruling.  She summarised the position, including recording submissions from WEH in the following terms:
“The Respondent addressed the Application in detail on 28 August 2023, objecting to the Application and, understandably (in the Sole Arbitrator’s view), pointing out that the Claimants had not raised the issue of the freezing injunction with the Sole Arbitrator or the Respondents for almost a month.  It asserted that the Application was “another guerrilla tactic which lacks any substance”.  It argued that the Respondent would suffer “substantial prejudice” were the Application to be granted.  It did not specify the form any such alleged prejudice would take.” (footnotes omitted)
and ruled:
“Under the LCIA Rules (in particular Article 14) the Sole Arbitrator has a broad discretion to conduct the arbitration in the manner she sees fit, ensuring the “fair, efficient and expeditious conduct of the arbitration”.  She must balance the competing interests of the parties in a fair and judicious manner.  Here, although it is deeply regrettable that the Claimants did not, for whatever reason, alert the Sole Arbitrator and the Respondent to the existence of the freezing injunction until the eleventh hour, she determines that a short adjournment of the hearing is appropriate in order for the Claimants to address the scope of the freezing injunction.
It is not appropriate, however, for the Claimants to reopen previous decisions of the Sole Arbitrator.  The adjournment is therefore granted on very limited grounds.
The Sole Arbitrator hereby directs:
the adjournment has been granted solely to allow the Claimants time to address the scope of the freezing injunction.  If it transpires that the freezing injunction does not permit the Claimants to spend monies on Counsel in this arbitration, this is not a ground for a further adjournment in this case;
the Claimants are not permitted to file or seek to file any new submissions or evidence;
pre-hearing briefing limited to 30 pages as per Procedural Order No.1 will be due one week prior to the rescheduled evidentiary hearing;
the Claimants are to pay all costs incurred in relation to the adjournment (and also, for the avoidance of doubt, all costs incurred in relation to the Sole Arbitrator’s rulings of 18 July 2023 and 14 August 2023);
the rescheduled evidentiary hearing in this matter will take place in October/November, subject to the availability of Counsel and the Sole Arbitrator.  In this regard, the Sole Arbitrator has availability to hear this matter over five days as follows:
4-6 and 9-10 October;
19-20 and 23-25 October;
13-17 November;
20-24 November;
Counsel is directed to revert to the Sole Arbitrator by close of business on 4 September 2023 confirming their availability.”
On 4 September 2023 Ruthberg emailed the arbitrator stating that they expected the freezing order issue to be resolved by the end of the consequentials hearing, but that would leave insufficient time to prepare for a hearing on 4-6 and 9-10 October 2023, and that one of the two associates working on the matter would be away during that period.  They said they expected their counsel to be available on 20-24 November but needed to check witness availability.  WEH pressed for a hearing on 4-6 and 9-10 October 2023.  On 5 September, Ruthberg stated that their counsel would be available for the evidential hearing on either 20 to 24 November, alternatively on 24 to 25 October and 15 to 17 November though it would be preferable not to split the hearing in that way. (I note that the period between the consequentials hearing – listed for 11-13 September – and 24 to 25 October was considerably less than the two-month period referred to in Ms Collins’ witness statement.) WEH then on 6 September indicated that 4 to 6 and 9 to 10 October had been made available; and that of the other dates, only 20 to 24 November was possible but would be very difficult due to personal commitments of WEH’s two factual witnesses.
Later on 6 September, the arbitrator directed that the evidential hearing would take place on 4 to 6 and 9 to 10 October 2023.
The consequentials hearing in the Litigation took place on 13 September 2023 before Calver J.  Despite instructing leading counsel to appear at the hearing, it appears the Claimants issued no application to vary the freezing order.  Instead, the Claimants’ counsel at the hearing made oral submissions indicating that permission had been sought from the Claimants in the Litigation for certain UK gilts worth about £1 million, held for Ms Collins by a Mr Barnard, to be liquidated and for the proceeds to be paid to Signature Litigation.  The present Claimants sought permission to use up to £500,000 of the proceeds in the arbitration proceedings.  Counsel for the claimants in the Litigation objected, saying:
“If they want to sell the shares, they need either to seek our agreement themselves, that is Signature for Ms Collins … for a variation of the freezing order to allow them to sell it or they apply to the court.  And let me make it plain; in circumstances where we have the most profound doubt as to what happened to the remainder of the £2.4 million, which Colome has received by way of dividends, we would oppose the sale of gilts.  Whilst they remain gilts, we know what they are, we know where they are, they are preserved.  As soon as they are liquidated and paid to Signature’s account, we will no doubt be told they are being used for legal expenses in X, Y, Z, location, which we then have to consider, come to the court about, etc.  There is plenty of money in the account.  If they need more money, then they need to justify it.
So insofar as there is a sort of ad hoc … application by Mr Dale [counsel for Ms Collins and the other Signature Litigation defendants] on his feet for a variation of the freezing order to enable it to be sold, I resist it.  We require full details of where those gilts, the money came from, before we would consider it.  And that is reasonable given the very profound doubts we and the court must have as to the reliability of anything which comes from or on behalf of Ms Collins at this stage.”
Colome was the 6th Defendant in the Litigation, jointly represented with Ms Collins and various other defendants by Signature Litigation.  Mr Dale KC responded, objecting that the Litigation claimants were seeking to prejudice the present Claimants in their legal representation.  Calver J ruled that any application to vary the freezing order would have to be made formally on proper notice to the Litigation claimants.  That ruling was reflected in a written order dated 13 September 2023 and sealed on 2 October 2023.
It is evident from the transcript quoted above that, at least from the Litigation claimants’ standpoint, the present Claimants were not merely seeking permission to spend money on the arbitration: they wanted permission to sell a particular valuable asset in circumstances where there was reason to believe that other funds existed which could be used instead, to the potential prejudice of the Litigation claimants.
The arbitrator on 18 September 2023 requested an update from the present Claimants’ counsel on the consequentials hearing the previous week.  Ruthberg responded simply by providing a copy of an extract from the transcript, including the passages I refer to above.
Then on 22 September 2023, Ruthberg wrote to the arbitrator saying:
“As you are aware, the Claimants cannot spend any sums in relation to this arbitration, as they would be in contempt of Court. The current order applies to everything except very limited personal expenses. It should further be noted that the Claimant cannot even presently pay venue fees without the risk of imprisonment.
The Claimants can only request an adjournment until the issue of the Freezing Order is resolved.
We have reiterated in the past the importance of this case as well as legal representation needed to ensure it is conducted fairly.
We should be in a clearer position on this matter by the end of November window previously requested, in which the Respondent is available in. Any potential detrimental impact raised by the Respondent is offset by the fact that as demonstrated, the Claimant cannot spend any monies on anything apart from a limited sum on the main case.”
The arbitrator responded the same day, denying the request for a further adjournment:
“The Claimants did not inform me of the existence of the freezing order and its impact on the Claimants’ ability to disburse funds in this arbitration until 28 August 2023.  On 29 August I asked “has an application been made to vary the freezing injunction?...If an application has not been made, why not?”. Claimants’ Counsel responded on 31 August 2023 that “if an application is required to be made to Court, the Claimants anticipate that the variation of the freezing injunction will be addressed at the consequentials hearing listed for 11-13 September 2023.”  It now appears that no application has been made to vary the freezing injunction, but that, according to Claimants’ Counsel on 19 September 2023 “an application will be made as soon as possible.” Today, there is a further request to delay the hearing, with no indication of whether an application to vary the freezing injunction will ever be made.
The freezing injunction was obtained against the Claimants on 31 July 2023.  There has been ample opportunity to make the requisite application.  The renewed request is denied. ”
The Claimants wrote to the arbitrator again on 26 September 2023:
“We believe that there is a misunderstanding which we hope this email will clarify.
The Freezing Order prohibits any use of assets except as specified with the consent of the other side’s lawyer, Wilkie Farr & Gallagher (“WFG”). A formal request was made to WFG of funds for the Arbitration. Arguably this was the ‘initial application’ to release funds.
WFG refused the request to use funds for the Arbitration.
With finance being a serious and legitimate issue, our clients made the same request to the same Judge who imposed the freezing order at the Consequential Hearing.  This is because, again, the freezing order does have a consent mechanism that didn’t need a formal application to vary the order. It would have been a waste of costs as well an aggressive act if our clients had made an application before the hearing. Such request was declined by the Judge – not least because Arbitrations are confidential and he needed further details - who then asked that a formal application be made for a variation of the Freezing Order.
Such application is currently being prepared but is hampered by the fact that the Claimants in the Arbitration are also making an application to stay the Judgement of Calver, J pending determination of application for leave to appeal.
As stated previously, our clients has every reason to continue with the Arbitration, they are however massively hampered by an inability to pay for the same.
In light of the above, we kindly request you revisit the decision made on Friday to allow for a few more weeks until our clients can in fact be represented properly.”
The arbitrator responded the same day indicating that the hearing dates were maintained.
On 28 September 2023 Mr Lakhaney emailed the arbitrator on behalf of the Claimants saying:
“We write to you directly as we cannot pay our lawyers despite the fact that they are in fact ready and willing to take this matter forward.
We understand the hearing dates for the arbitration will remain fixed as per your last communication. As we have informed you, we are unfortunately unable to incur any costs to book the venue, however as Ms Collins resides in the UK, she shall attend the arbitration in person at any venue that you instruct her to attend. As Mr Lakhaney and Mr Reansuwan are not in country, they will be unable to attend given the same costs issues. Mr Lakhaney can make himself available via Zoom.
The process to vary the worldwide freezing order is taking more time than expected which in addition to procedure is hampered by the fact that we are unable to instruct a firm to make the application as we are unable to pay any new legal fees as per the current orders in the UK proceedings. Given this, we will unfortunately have no legal representation with us, no witnesses with the exception of Ms Collins and Mr Lakhaney (via video link) and no administrative assistance and a such we will not be able to submit a pre-hearing brief which we understand is due on 29 September.
We again reiterate that we are in this position precisely because of the Defendant’s tactically cutting off funding that it was obliged to provide, and the Defendants are taking advantage of a situation of their making. We will be unable to properly pursue this claim until we have sought and obtained a variation of the Worldwide Freezing Order.
In the above circumstances we believe that it would be against the basic principles of justice for the Arbitration not to be adjourned until the Worldwide Freezing Order has been varied. Notwithstanding, Ms Collins will attend the Arbitration hearings at the appointed dates if Latham & Watkins can provide details of the time and venue.”
The arbitrator replied on the same day saying:
“Thank you for your email below, the contents of which are duly noted. Ms Collins (and any other Claimants) are invited to attend any and all parts of the hearing and Ms Collins is welcome to make an opening submission setting out the Claimants’ position on the claim and counterclaim.
While the hearing is a firm setting and will not be moved by me, it is always open to the parties to reach agreement on the arbitration procedure and it may be that the Claimants wish to reach out to the Respondent’s representatives in this regard.
I also invite the Respondent’s representatives to ensure that the Claimants are fully informed regarding hearing logistics, have received copies of the joint hearing bundle and are generally assisted where necessary as a matter of professional courtesy, given the Claimants’ lack of legal representation.  Please also reach out to the Claimants to discuss and amend the indicative hearing timetable as appropriate.”
On 29 September 2023 Mr Lakhaney replied to the arbitrator, on behalf of the Claimants, saying:
“… Latham & Watkins have reached out as to the hearing logistics and have asked us some questions in relation to the hearing, to which we are not clear about, but Ms Collins will reach out directly to Latham & Watkins to discuss. We had one other matter that we would please request you to consider:
Prior to Signature Litigation coming off the record, they had put together various documents to be submitted to the Respondent’s last submission. I have attached the main documents for reference - including a draft Sur Reply, signed witness statements (incl. an expert witness statement), final unsigned witness statements (that can be signed), and relevant exhibits (exhibits not attached given size constraints). We understand that it is late but as we will not be in a position to conduct cross examinations of witnesses nor argue legal points we wanted to know if we can submit these documents so as to address the Respondent’s last submission and at least be able to provide some final submissions in writing for you to consider as you make your decision.
Subsequently, we have also found one additional email in Ms Collins’ possession which is from Watson Farley & Williams (WEH’s corporate lawyer) addressed to the WEH Board of Directors specifically in relation to the Letter of Indemnity and their views on its validity. We think this is a material document and would request that it is entered into evidence.…”
The attachments to Mr Lakhaney’s email were a Sur-Reply (albeit marked as a draft), two signed witness statements, three unsigned witness statements, a signed expert’s report and one email.
Also on 29 September, WEH filed its Pre-Hearing Brief.
Later the same day, in reply to Mr Lakhaney’s email, the arbitrator wrote to the parties:
“Please note that I have removed representatives from Ruthberg LLC from this correspondence, given that I understand that the Claimants are no longer represented in these proceedings.
I am disappointed by the Claimants’ extremely late filing of a lengthy submission and evidence (in the form of a further expert report, witness statements and one additional exhibit).  There was no reason why this could not have been filed sooner, rather than waiting until two working days before the evidentiary hearing.
I have determined that, in light of the fact that the Claimants are no longer legally represented and have indicated that they will not be filing a Pre-Hearing Brief, that the draft Sur-Reply will stand in lieu of a Pre-Hearing Brief.  I will consider it alongside the Respondent’s Pre-Hearing Brief, which I received a few minutes ago.
In relation to the late evidence, should the Respondent choose to make a formal application to exclude this evidence, I will hear that application during the evidentiary hearing.  Should the Respondent not make an application, or should I determine, following any such  application, that the evidence should be admitted to the record, I will, of course, accord that evidence the weight I consider it deserves.
Finally, I wish to pick up on a point in Mr Lakhaney’s email of this afternoon.  He says “we will not be in a position to conduct cross examinations of witnesses nor argue legal points” during the evidentiary hearing.  As I made clear in my email of yesterday, as litigants in person the Claimants are invited to attend all parts of the evidentiary hearing and will be permitted to put their positions on the claim and counterclaim and participate fully in the hearing, including cross examination of witnesses and making an opening submission, should they so wish.”
Also on 29 September 2023, WEH replied, again complaining about the late filing by the Claimants, and the fact that the Sur-Reply referred to new evidence, and stated that WEH would face prejudice were new documents and evidence admitted.  It asked the arbitrator to confirm that only those parts of the draft Sur-Reply which referred to material on the record as of 1 September 2023 be taken into account, and the balance disregarded. WEH also suggested that, in light of the fact that only Ms Collins and Mr Lakhaney would be attending, revisions should be made to the timetable for the evidential hearing.
On 30 September 2023 the arbitrator replied to WEH. She clarified that the evidence filed by the Claimants the previous day would not form part of the record until after WEH had made any application to exclude, and to the extent no such application was made, or was unsuccessful, the arbitrator would give the evidence such weight as it deserved.
On 1 October 2023 Mr Lakhaney sent a further email to the arbitrator, contending that Calver J had denied the Claimants permission to fund lawyers for the arbitration, which had led to Ruthberg not finalising the Claimants’ arbitration submissions and then coming off the record.  The email also included this:
Instructing new solicitors with an inability to spend our own funds has been challenging but we are speaking to firms on the matter so as to seek a variation of the WFO, it is just taking time.
In the meanwhile, as these hearing dates have been fixed and we are representing ourselves, we think that even in draft form, the replies, witness statements, and exhibits (all prepared but not served by Signature Litigation) are better than anything we would be able to prepare ourselves (as laypeople with no legal or arbitral background). These submissions would also do a better job presenting our case as they directly address the points made by the Respondent’s. We did not send the exhibits and attachments to the documents sent earlier given size issues – please do let us know if these would be helpful / should be sent to you as you make your decision on whether to include them.
We also do not agree with the characterization of “guerilla tactics”. There is no reason that we would risk not having made these submissions earlier at the risk of them being disregarded. We believed we had solicitors engaged and that they would have finalized these documents for submission but as explained above due to a restriction of payments, this ended up not being the case.
We also believe that the additional email that was recently located and not disclosed that sent from Watson Farley & Williams and addressed to the Respondent’s board of directors goes to the heart of the matter and is material to these proceedings.
We appreciate your confirmation that we are free to engage in the proceedings to the extent we wish, and we will attempt to do so to the best of our abilities given the circumstances. We also confirm that the Respondent’s lawyers did email us at 11:27pm UK time Thursday and asked for a response by 12pm the following day. We informed them that we would reach out on Monday. While their questions are second nature to them as professional litigators, we do need a little bit more time to consider what is being asked and the subsequent implications.
We do ask that you please take the above into account as you make your decision. We do apologize again as we appreciate that this is unorthodox but are sincerely attempting to do our best given where we are.”
On 2 October 2023 at 6.09pm Mr Lakhaney wrote to the arbitrator again saying:
“We have been under a huge amount of pressure and stress since losing the UK civil case, legal funding and solicitors together with a judgment that has prevented us from using funds we have on account.
In addition:
As we have stated previously, in the UK civil proceedings, we had been diligently preparing appeal, interim stay, and stay documentation for submission to the Court of Appeal. The Permission to Appeal Skeleton, Grounds of Appeal, Stay Skeleton and ancillary documentation The preparation of these documents had as you can appreciate consumed all of our time, especially as they had to be submitted within 21 days of the consequential hearing for the UK civil proceedings.  Today these documents were submitted.
We strongly dispute the current ruling in the UK civil case, and we understand the Respondents have used parts of that ruling in their most recent skeleton. We believe that any views taken in relation to that judgement should also take into account our grounds for appeal (which we can share with you if requested).
We again appreciate your invitation to participate in these proceedings. However, we believe that we have had an inability to present the claim / defend the counterclaim properly due to the lack of legal representation due to the freezing order and the fact that our solicitors were forced to stand down. We have tried to follow the process for obtaining agreement on accessing the funds we have available, and this is ongoing. We have had no interaction with lawyers or our experts and witnesses and have had to submit incomplete documents which is obviously not satisfactory.
The Respondent’s will have one of the world’s leading law firms, administrative staff and a KC and neither Ms Collins or Mr Lakhaney have no legal or arbitral background. We are worried that with no representation we would have no protection / be at risk of incriminating ourselves in other civil and criminal proceedings brought by the Respondents (in these proceedings) and the Claimants (in the UK civil proceedings).
As Claimants, we have repeatedly asked for a stay to these proceedings to allow us time to obtain access to our funds – we feel that this situation is very prejudicial to us as we are proceeding with attempting to amend the freezing order, but it will not be done in time to affect this hearing.
Given the above, Ms Collins is not in any emotional state to attend the hearing alone or submit herself to cross examination without counsel and the risk of further incriminating herself in other proceedings brought by the respondent.
Mr Lakhaney shares the same concerns as above but will make himself available via video link for cross examination. Mr Lakhaney will reach out to Latham & Watkins on arranging a logistics.” (emphasis in original)
Ms Collins in her witness statement in the present proceedings says she had, by this stage, suffered a breakdown and collapsed at home.  If so, Mr Lakhaney’s email did not convey that to the arbitrator, referring only to Ms Collins being “not in any emotional state to attend the hearing alone or submit herself to cross examination without counsel”.  Nor did Mr Lakhaney’s email seek an adjournment on the grounds of Ms Collins’ ill health.
The arbitrator replied the following morning, 3 October 2023, noting among other things that “The decision of the Claimants not to participate in the hearing, save for the willingness of Mr Lakhaney to make himself available for cross-examination (which is appreciated), will impact the indicative timetable suggested for the evidentiary hearing.”  The arbitrator also referred to travel disruption the following day and asked the parties to consider deferring the start of the hearing to 5 October.
Ms Collins replied shortly afterwards, saying:
“My doctor, whom I saw yesterday and today, has instructed me to convey to you that I am not fit to attend the hearing as I am suffering from anxiety and depressive order.  I attach my written evidence.”
She attached a “Statement of Fitness for Work For social security or Statutory Sick Pay” dated 3 October 2023, in which the doctor said “Mrs Collins is taking venlafaxine antidepressant medication and has been referred to the mental health services and psychiatrist”.  The Statement advised that Ms Collins would not be fit for work for four weeks.
Ms Collins’ email did not state that she or the Claimants were requesting an adjournment, and it does not appear to have been understood as doing so by the arbitrator, who simply responded “Thank you for this information.  I wish you a prompt recovery.”  In the Award, after quoting Mr Lakhaney’s email of the evening of 2 October (quoted above), the arbitrator said:
“It was therefore only on the eve of the evidentiary hearing that it became apparent that the Claimants had elected not to attend and not to exercise their rights to address the Sole Arbitrator and cross-examine the Respondent’s fact and expert witnesses, on the stated grounds of concerns about possible incrimination in relation to other proceedings and, additionally in relation to Ms Collins, medical grounds.FN” (Footnote) “Ms Collins provided medical evidence of her inability to attend the evidentiary hearing by email on 3 October 2023.”
Again on 3 October, WEH replied to the arbitrator’s first email of that morning, saying:
“The Respondent’s team has already made arrangements (including booking hotels, etc.) to attend the IDRC tomorrow and wishes for the hearing to proceed as planned, in particular because of the urgent need for the Tribunal to resolve the issue of whether the Claimants should be allowed to introduce a significant quantity of new evidence on the eve of the hearing. No good reason has been advanced by the Claimants as to why they should be given permission for this (which flies in the face of your previous orders) but we understand that you still wish the Respondent to address you on the matter at the hearing. That is the first order of business and the Respondent needs your decision so that it can plan the rest of the hearing accordingly. It is not feasible to wait until Thursday before addressing this as the new evidence impacts all aspects of the hearing (opening submissions, witness and expert evidence). The Respondent therefore wishes to address you on this in person at the IDRC tomorrow morning, so that it knows where it stands and the hearing can proceed accordingly.”
The arbitrator responded indicating that the hearing would proceed as planned on 4 October.
Mr Lakhaney replied to the arbitrator later the same day to WEH’s point about new evidence, saying that “when your previous order was made there was the prevailing view / assumption that we would have legal representation who would make submissions and represent us. This is a material fact that has changed and we request that this be taken into consideration as the Respondent’s make their request and you make your decision.”
The evidential hearing commenced on the morning of 4 October 2023.   The Claimants were not present or represented.  WEH applied to exclude the draft Sur-Reply and draft evidence.  After hearing submissions, the arbitrator made a decision, which was confirmed in a written ruling later that day saying:
The draft witness statements of Emma Louise Collins, Aman Lakhaney and Thun Reansuwan are not admitted to the record;
The witness statements of Wichai Thongtang and Nuttawut Phowborom, and the second expert report of Dr Nattaphol Chinawong, are admitted to the record, with the Tribunal to give those such weight as it considers appropriate taking account those witnesses have not been made available for cross examination;
The email from Watson Farley & Williams to Emma Louise Collins dated 9 November 2020 is admitted to the record.
The Claimants’ draft Sur-Reply dated 28 July 2023 will be admitted to the record and stand as the Claimants’ pre-hearing brief, save that any references in that document to new material are excluded. The Tribunal has approved a redacted version of the draft Sur-Reply proposed by the Respondent (see ‘A-007’).
…
Further, please note that the hearing was adjourned today to give the Respondent time to address the new evidence that has been admitted to the record and will resume on Friday 6 October at 10.00am. We have separately notified Mr Lakhaney that we anticipate he will be required for cross examination from 1:00 pm (London) / 8.00 am (New York) on Friday 6 October and will be in touch with him tomorrow to confirm.”
The following day, 5 October 2023, Mr Lakhaney emailed the arbitrator saying:
“In relation to the below notice, we are not clear / do not agree with the Claimant’s witness statements not being admitted on the record as there seems to be a distinction between signed and unsigned statements – a technicality as our statements could easily have been signed before being emailed. We had asked about how to share the documents referred to therein (given size constraints) but received no response. I do reiterate that this does not seem fair as we remain litigants in person and these statements and documents were quite important as they showed the WEH board of directors, shareholders, and other key stakeholders were fully aware of the litigation and approved the payment of legal expenses.
I confirm that I have been notified by Latham & Watkins that I will be required for cross examination at 1:00 pm (London) / 8.00 am (New York) on Friday 6 October at their New York City offices and will be there at the appointed time unless otherwise notified.”
The evidential hearing reconvened on 6 October 2023. Again, the Claimants were not present or represented at the hearing, save that Mr Lakhaney was cross-examined remotely.  WEH made its opening submissions, during which process the arbitrator intervened on numerous occasions to seek clarification of matters.  WEH called its experts, which affirmed their reports and answered brief supplementary questions from counsel (including expressing disagreement with the Claimants’ new expert report i.e. the 2nd report of Dr Chinawong).  This was followed by cross-examination of Mr Lakhaney, who had submitted two witness statements.  The arbitrator intervened on several occasions to query the basis for a question or to ask counsel to move on, and several further times to ask the witness a question.  WEH’s witnesses of fact then affirmed their written evidence, and stated in examination in chief that they did not agree with the Claimants’ new evidence of fact.  The arbitrator did not put any questions to WEH’s experts or witnesses of fact.  The evidentiary hearing was then closed.
Ms Collins exhibited to her evidence in the present proceedings a report from a consultant psychiatrist dated 11 October 2023 and a letter from a GP dated 13 October 2023.  These indicated that Ms Collins had presented with acute stress and anxiety about two weeks previously; was at moderate risk of suicide at first presentation and distraught; had reported suicidal thoughts since August-September; had been diagnosed as suffering from adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood; and had improved somewhat since then.
Submissions in relation to costs were made on behalf of the parties on 20 October and 3 November 2023.
On 17 November 2023 the arbitrator circulated her Award.  In summary, she rejected the Claimants’ claim, and allowed WEH’s counterclaim. In the disposition of the Award, the arbitrator:
declared that the LOI was unenforceable and rejected the Claimants’ claim that WEH was in breach of it;
directed that the Claimants, on a joint and several basis, should repay to WEH the £7,654,186 odd which had been paid to Stephenson Harwood and Simmons & Simmons in relation to the Claimants’ legal costs, and awarded pre- and post-award interest on that sum;
directed that the First to Third Claimants should repay to WEH the sums disbursed to Byrne & Partners in relation to the legal costs of Messrs Narongdej and Phowborom, plus pre- and post-award interest on those sums; and
directed the Claimants to pay WEH’s legal costs of the arbitration in the sum of USD 3,067,291, plus the arbitration costs of £47,700.
PRINCIPLES
Section 33 of the Act provides:
— General duty of the tribunal.
The tribunal shall—
act fairly and impartially as between the parties, giving each party a reasonable opportunity of putting his case and dealing with that of his opponent, and
adopt procedures suitable to the circumstances of the particular case, avoiding unnecessary delay or expense, so as to provide a fair means for the resolution of the matters falling to be determined.
The tribunal shall comply with that general duty in conducting the arbitral proceedings, in its decisions on matters of procedure and evidence and in the exercise of all other powers conferred on it.”
Section 68 provides:
— Challenging the award: serious irregularity
A party to arbitral proceedings may (upon notice to the other parties and to the tribunal) apply to the court challenging an award in the proceedings on the ground of serious irregularity affecting the tribunal, the proceedings or the award. A party may lose the right to object (see section 73) and the right to apply is subject to the restrictions in section 70(2) and (3).
Serious irregularity means an irregularity of one or more of the following kinds which the court considers has caused or will cause substantial injustice to the applicant—
failure by the tribunal to comply with section 33 (general duty of tribunal);
the tribunal exceeding its powers (otherwise than by exceeding its substantive jurisdiction: see section 67);
failure by the tribunal to conduct the proceedings in accordance with the procedure agreed by the parties;
failure by the tribunal to deal with all the issues that were put to it;
any arbitral or other institution or person vested by the parties with powers in relation to the proceedings or the award exceeding its powers;
uncertainty or ambiguity as to the effect of the award;
the award being obtained by fraud or the award or the way in which it was procured being contrary to public policy;
failure to comply with the requirements as to the form of the award; or any irregularity in the conduct of the proceedings or in the award which is admitted by the tribunal or by any arbitral or other institution or person vested by the parties with powers in relation to the proceedings or the award.
If there is shown to be serious irregularity affecting the tribunal, the proceedings or the award, the court may—
remit the award to the tribunal, in whole or in part, for reconsideration,
set the award aside in whole or in part, or
declare the award to be of no effect, in whole or in part.
The court shall not exercise its power to set aside or to declare an award to be of no effect, in whole or in part, unless it is satisfied that it would be inappropriate to remit the matters in question to the tribunal for reconsideration.
The leave of the court is required for any appeal from a decision of the court under this section.”
It has been stated that section 68 is designed as a longstop remedy, available only where the tribunal has gone so wrong in its conduct of the arbitration in one of the respects listed in section 68(2) that justice calls out for it to be corrected: Konkola Copper Mines v U&M Mining Zambia Ltd [2014] EWHC 2374 (Comm) at [14].  A challenge under section 68 involves a “high hurdle” and there will be a serious irregularity only if what has occurred is far removed from what could reasonably be expected from the arbitral process: Islamic Republic of Pakistan v Broadsheet LLC [2019] Bus LR 2753 at [17].
Article 14 of the LCIA Rules (effective 1 October 2020) includes these provisions:
“Article 14 Conduct of Proceedings
Under the Arbitration Agreement, the Arbitral Tribunal’s general duties at all times during the arbitration shall include:
a duty to act fairly and impartially as between all parties, giving each a reasonable opportunity of putting its case and dealing with that of its opponent(s); and
a duty to adopt procedures suitable to the circumstances of the arbitration, avoiding unnecessary delay and expense, so as to provide a fair, efficient and expeditious means for the final resolution of the parties’ dispute.
The Arbitral Tribunal shall have the widest discretion to discharge these general duties, subject to the mandatory provisions of any applicable law or any rules of law the Arbitral Tribunal may decide to be applicable; and at all times the parties shall do everything necessary in good faith for the fair, efficient and expeditious conduct of the arbitration, including the Arbitral Tribunal’s discharge of its general duties.
…
Without prejudice to the generality of the Arbitral Tribunal’s discretion, after giving the parties a reasonable opportunity to state their views, the Arbitral Tribunal may, subject to the LCIA Rules, make any procedural order it considers appropriate with regard to the fair, efficient and expeditious conduct of the arbitration.”
In some situations it has been held that a party needs legal representation in order to have a fair hearing.  In Airey v Ireland (1979-80) 2 EHRR 305, the European Court of Human Rights held the unavailability of legal aid to an applicant seeking to petition for judicial separation from her husband to be in breach of Article 6 of the Convention.  She could not effectively conduct her own case in circumstances where:
“In Ireland, a decree of judicial separation is not obtainable in a District Court, where the procedure is relatively simple, but only in the High Court. A specialist in Irish family law, Mr. Alan J. Shatter, regards the High Court as the least accessible court not only because “fees payable for representation before it are very high” but also by reason of the fact that “the procedure for instituting proceedings . . . is complex particularly in the case of those proceedings which must be commenced by a petition”, such as those for separation.
Furthermore, litigation of this kind, in addition to involving complicated points of law, necessitates proof of adultery, unnatural practices or, as in the present case, cruelty; to establish the facts, expert evidence may have to be tendered and witnesses may have to be found, called and examined. What is more, marital disputes often entail an emotional involvement that is scarcely compatible with the degree of objectivity required by advocacy in court.
For these reasons, the Court considers it most improbable that a person in Mrs. Airey’s position (see para. 8 above) can effectively present his or her own case. This view is corroborated by the Government’s replies to the questions put by the Court, replies which reveal that in each of the 255 judicial separation proceedings initiated in Ireland in the period from January 1972 to December 1978, without exception, the petitioner was represented by a lawyer (see para. 11 above).” (§ 24)
The court made clear that that did not mean effective access to a court required legal representation in all civil cases: there may be cases where representing oneself secures adequate access even to the High Court, and “much must depend on the particular circumstances” (§ 26).
The Court of Appeal in Terluk v Berezovsky [2010] EWCA Civ 1345, in a rolled up hearing, held there to be an arguable case that the trial judge was wrong to refuse an adjournment to allow the defendant to a libel case time to seek and obtain legal representation; but dismissed the appeal on the facts in circumstances where there was no clarity as to where the funding for legal representation was going to come from.
Fairness may require an adjournment due to a party’s inability to attend for health reasons.  In Teinaz v Wandsworth LBC [2002] EWCA Civ 1040 the Court of Appeal said:
A litigant whose presence is needed for the fair trial of a case, but who is unable to be present through no fault of his own, will usually have to be granted an adjournment, however inconvenient it may be to the tribunal or court and to the other parties. That litigant's right to a fair trial under Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights demands nothing less. But the tribunal or court is entitled to be satisfied that the inability of the litigant to be present is genuine, and the onus is on the applicant for an adjournment to prove the need for such an adjournment.
If there is some evidence that a litigant is unfit to attend, in particular if there is evidence that on medical grounds the litigant has been advised by a qualified person not to attend, but the tribunal or court has doubts as to whether the evidence is genuine or sufficient, the tribunal or court has a discretion whether or not to give a direction such as would enable the doubts to be resolved. Thus, one possibility is to direct that further evidence be provided promptly. Another is that the party seeking the adjournment should be invited to authorise the legal representatives for the other side to have access to the doctor giving the advice in question. The advocates on both sides can do their part in assisting the tribunal faced with such a problem to achieve a just result. I do not say that a tribunal or court necessarily makes any error of law in not taking such steps. All must depend on the particular circumstances of the case. I make these comments in recognition of the fact that applications for an adjournment on the basis of a medical certificate may present difficult problems requiring practical solutions if justice is to be achieved.
…
... If a party chooses deliberately not to attend, then that is clearly most material to the exercise of discretion. But to my mind it is no less clear that if a doctor has advised his patient not to attend the hearing and the patient obeys that advice, it is unfair to describe the patient as choosing not to attend and to treat that as a factor against exercising the discretion to adjourn.”
The appellant in Teinaz had provided a standard form sick certificate, which had then been supported by a more detailed letter from the doctor explaining his condition and the doctor’s advice, including advice that (a) if the appellant did not take at least two weeks off work he would be in serious danger with a great risk to his health, and (b) he must equally avoid any stress-inducing task including attending any court.
In Solanki v Intercity Telecom Ltd [2018] EWCA Civ 101 the Court of Appeal held that a judge should have granted an adjournment to a litigant who sought a 6-8 week adjournment to recover from stress-related illness, supported by a “comprehensive” (§ 19) letter from his GP setting out the appellant’s condition and treatment over a period of almost a year.
Solanki was followed in Bilta (UK) Ltd (in liquidation) v Tradition Financial Services Ltd [2021] EWCA Civ 221, where two important witnesses had been unable to attend the trial of a complex fraud case for bona fide medical reasons but there was every reason to believe they could have attended given an adjournment.  The Court of Appeal stated the principle at § 30:
“… the guiding principle in an application to adjourn of  this type is whether if the trial goes ahead it will be fair in all the circumstances; that the assessment of what is fair is a fact-sensitive one, and not one to be judged by the mechanistic application of any particular checklist; that although the inability of a party himself to attend trial through illness will almost always be a highly material consideration, it is artificial to seek to draw a sharp distinction between that case and the unavailability of a witness; and that the significance to be attached to the inability of an important witness to attend through illness will vary from case to case, but that it will usually be material, and may be decisive.  And if the refusal of an adjournment would make the resulting trial unfair, an adjournment should ordinarily be granted, regardless of inconvenience to the other party or other court users, unless this were outweighed by injustice to the other party that could not be compensated for.”
APPLICATION
Ground 1: evidential hearing in October 2024
The Claimants submit that the arbitrator was in breach of her section 33 duty by granting an unrealistically short adjournment of the evidential hearing from 11 September 2023 to 4 October 2023 in response to the Claimants’ application of 28 August 2023; and then in pressing ahead with the evidential hearing on 4 October 2023 in the face of requests from the Claimants to reconsider her decision given the obvious continuing difficulties the Claimants faced with the lack of legal representation, and Ms Collins’ mental health issues.  The Claimants draw particular attention to a number of points, which may be summarised as follows:
The Claimants did not have any legal representation in relation to the arbitration, save in respect of the adjournment application, after Signature Litigation ceased to represent them on 1 August 2023.
As the arbitrator was told, Ruthberg and Berkeley Rowe were willing to act only if the freezing order were varied; and the Claimants had not been able to find any third-party funding by that stage.
Even after funding was obtained, the Claimants’ lawyers would need enough time to prepare for the hearing.  Ms Collins explained in the witness statement provided to the arbitrator that the earliest the evidential hearing could take place was two months after the date of variation of the freezing order to allow the Claimants’ counsel to prepare.
The arbitrator failed to grapple with the point that Ruthberg and Berkeley Rowe were not at that stage prepared to commit to preparing for, or representing the Claimants at, the evidential hearing until the funding issue was resolved; and seems to have proceeded on the incorrect basis that Ruthberg had been preparing and assisting the Claimants substantively in relation to the evidential hearing since mid-August 2023.
The lack of legal representation was not a choice made by the Claimants but a direct consequence of the freezing order having been made, and then of the Litigation claimants (who are linked to WEH) not agreeing to a variation of the freezing order to allow expenditure on legal fees for the arbitration.  That was plainly tactical on the part of those ultimately behind WEH in order to prejudice the Claimants’ ability to bring their claim and to defend WEH’s counterclaim in the arbitration.
The Claimants were led to believe by their lawyers, Signature Litigation, that submissions would be made at the return date of 14 August 2023 for variation of the freezing order, and that a formal application would be made prior to the consequentials hearing on 11 to 13 September 2023. The lawyers failed in both those respects and the Claimants are considering a potential claim against them.
Even if a variation to the freezing order had been obtained after 13 September 2023, it would have still left insufficient time for any legal representatives to prepare for the evidential hearing prior to 4 October 2023, as had been made clear to the arbitrator by both Ms Collins and Ruthberg.
Ms Collins’ evidence is that she suffered a breakdown on 2 October 2023, requiring emergency medical treatment.  Whilst the arbitrator was informed about Ms Collins’ medical diagnosis only shortly before the hearing, indications had been provided at an earlier stage which put the arbitrator on notice of the issues she was facing.  In particular, in her evidence in support of the adjournment application made on 28 August 2023, Ms Collins had explained “the immense emotional toll and stress that the domestic proceedings have caused and are continuing to cause.”
It is unrealistic to suggest (as WEH does) that Mr Lakhaney, Ms Siddique or Mr Reansuwan could have attended the hearing, made submissions, and asked questions of WEH’s witnesses.  None of them is legally trained.  Ms Siddique had no or very limited involvement in the relevant matters (as recorded by the arbitrator in the Final Award).  Further, as with Ms Collins, Mr Lakhaney and Mr Reansuwan had been busy dealing with developments in the Litigation.  Given the volume of evidence, expert evidence and submissions made in the arbitration it was unrealistic to consider they could have prepared adequately for the evidential hearing. By contrast, WEH had an experienced specialist legal team which had no doubt been focusing on preparation for many weeks.
I am unable to accept the Claimants’ submissions that the arbitrator breached her section 33 duties or that a serious irregularity occurred.
On the materials made available to the arbitrator, the Claimants’ lack of legal representation was a result of their failure, over a period of time, to take proper and prompt steps to obtain a variation of the freezing order (assuming such a variation to have been necessary).
As set out earlier, the Claimants’ solicitors wrote to the arbitrator on 31 July 2023, in the immediate aftermath of the Judgment and the freezing order, about the future of the arbitration, making no suggestion that there was any problem about legal representation in the arbitration.  Mr Lakhaney’s messages of 8 August and 10 August likewise gave no hint of any such problem, even though they specifically contemplated the engagement of international legal counsel for the arbitration.
There was an obvious opportunity to address any need to vary the freezing order at the return date on 14 August, but it was not taken up: even though the Claimants had four days’ previously sought permission (in Mr Lakhaney’s 10 August message) to reinstate their arbitration claims.  Even Ruthberg’s letter of 14 August, the day of the return date hearing, made no suggestion of any difficulty about funding of legal representation in the arbitration.
The Claimants thus did not raise the problem about the freezing order until 28 August, almost a month after it had been made and only two weeks before the then date for the evidential hearing.
Even then, their (long and detailed) application for an adjournment was unspecific both about how long it would take to make an application to vary/clarify the freezing order, and about how much time might be required for subsequent preparation work.  (I have already made the point that Ms Collins’ two-month estimate was not reflected or justified in Ruthberg’s 18-page adjournment application, and was inconsistent with Ruthberg’s apparent willingness to have a hearing six weeks after the date of the consequentials hearing in the Litigation.)
In these circumstances it is unsurprising that the arbitrator was reluctant – taking into account the aspect of her section 33 duties concerning the avoidance of unnecessary delay – to grant a lengthy or open-ended adjournment.
In any event, having obtained an adjournment from the arbitrator, the Claimants inexplicably failed again to take the obviously necessary steps required in order to seek variation/clarification of the freezing order at the consequentials hearing in September, despite having continuing legal representation in the Litigation.  No application notice was issued or served.  Instead, counsel for the Claimants made an oral application which, predictably, the Litigation claimants and the judge were unwilling to entertain without proper notice having been given.  Even then, the transcript indicates that the Claimants sought to cherry pick an asset to sell in order to fund legal representation, in circumstances where there were evidently grounds on which the Litigation claimants and the court would seriously question why other funds could not be used instead.  Thus, even as made orally, the attempted application was calculated (whether deliberately or not) to fail or at least to give rise to further enquiry and likely delay.  Whilst the Claimants now seek to blame their legal representatives, no information was given to the arbitrator to suggest that the representatives had done anything other than act on the Claimants’ instructions.  In these circumstances, any debate about whether the period between the consequentials hearing and the evidential hearing was adequate becomes somewhat hypothetical; but, in any event, given the lack of any reasoned basis for seeking a longer period (see § 84 above) I would not have concluded that the arbitrator acted unfairly in listing the start of the evidential hearing for 4 October 2023.
Following the consequentials hearing, the Claimants in their communications to the arbitrator of 22, 26 and 28 September and 1 October 2023 continued to give no estimated date by which any application to vary the freezing order would be made.
I do not accept the Claimants’ suggestion that the arbitrator was under the misapprehension that Ruthberg had been helping the Claimants prepare for the evidential hearing (as opposed to merely the application to adjourn): there is no evidence of any such misapprehension, and in § 26 of the Award the arbitrator quoted the Claimants’ message of 31 August indicating that Ruthberg were unwilling to accept instructions to act in the arbitration without a variation of the freezing order.  The arbitrator’s ruling of 1 September was explicitly premised on the effect of the freezing order, and it specifically contemplated in § (i) that, absent a variation, the Claimants might have to proceed without representation in the arbitration.
In all these circumstances, the arbitrator’s decision to proceed with the hearing on 4 October 2023 was fair and consistent with her duties under section 33 of the Act and LCIA Article 14.  The Claimants had had ample opportunity to resolve any problem about the freezing order and obtain legal representation, but had made no realistic efforts to do so.  They remained entitled to represent themselves, for example through Ms Collins or Mr Lakhaney.  As recorded in Calver J’s judgment, Ms Collins had been co-CEO and then CEO of WEH for six years, and Mr Lakhaney had been its Head of Corporate Finance and a director.  It appears that Mr Lakhaney had been actively engaged in procedural steps in the Litigation following the Judgment; and, as quoted above, he engaged in detailed correspondence with the arbitrator about the arbitration.  As recorded in §§ 49 and 52 above, the arbitrator took steps to ensure that the Claimants were fairly treated as unrepresented parties and to ensure they understood they were entitled to participate fully in the evidential hearing; and, given the Claimants’ lack of representation, the arbitrator decided to allow their draft Sur-Reply to stand in lieu of a Pre-Hearing Brief.
Ms Collins’ mental health problems were communicated to the arbitrator only at the last minute, and Mr Lakhaney’s message on the evening of 2 October made no reference to Ms Collins having suffered a breakdown (as she now says she had).  The medical evidence submitted to the arbitrator on the morning of 3 October, the day before the hearing, was a standard form statutory sickness note.  In all the circumstances (and given the history), had Ms Collins’ problems been put forward as a ground for an adjournment, the arbitrator might reasonably have been sceptical about them and sought further and better evidence.  However, they were not so put forward: the arbitrator was not asked to adjourn on this ground, either by Ms Collins in her message of 3 October or by Mr Lakhaney: whether in his message of 2 October or when he appeared remotely at the hearing to give evidence.
In all the circumstances, I do not consider that the arbitrator acted unfairly by not (effectively of her own volition) adjourning the hearing in response to Ms Collins’ message and its attachment.
Nor, in any event, would I have been persuaded that any substantial injustice was caused by Ms Collins’ absence.  It would have been open to Mr Lakhaney to make submissions on the Claimants’ behalf, and there is no indication that Ms Collins’ oral testimony would have been critical to the outcome  Although reference is made in the Award to part of her witness statement and to her absence (§§ 72 and 73), the issues in the arbitration turned to a large degree on questions of law and construction and/or documentary evidence.  The arbitrator also had the benefit of Ms Collins’ written evidence, the Claimants’ other signed witness statements and expert evidence, and the submissions in their Reply and draft Sur-Reply.
Ground 2: approach to Sur-Reply and evidence
The Claimants submit that although the draft Sur-Reply and additional evidence were late (and no formal application was made to admit them), fairness required the arbitrator to admit them in full in circumstances where the Claimants were unrepresented and Ms Collins was unable to attend for medical reasons.  It is said that WEH could if necessary have been given additional time to review and address them.
However, the new material comprised an 80-page draft Sur-Reply, five witness statements (three of them unsigned), an expert’s report and one document.  It was sent to WEH only two business days before the hearing.  As WEH points out, the documents appear to have been in final or near final form since at least 28 July.  The arbitrator decided to allow the draft Sur-Reply to stand in place of a Pre-Hearing Brief and to admit in evidence the two signed witness statements, the expert’s report and the document.  She had already received evidence from the Claimants with their Reply on 17 February 2023.  Award § 12 indicates that the arbitrator had before her witness statements from six witnesses of fact including Ms Collins and Mr Lakhaney.  In all the circumstances, it was not unfair for her to refuse also to admit, at the very last minute, three unsigned witness statements.
The Claimants also submit that at the evidential hearing, the arbitrator failed to act fairly and impartially by not testing the credibility of WEH’s main witness of fact, Ms Asiano, nor the cogency of WEH’s case in general.  I do not accept that submission.  The Claimants had been given a fair opportunity to participate in the hearing, whether legally represented or not, and in person or remotely.  It was for the arbitrator to determine to what extent she found it necessary to probe WEH’s evidence and submissions (which, as noted earlier, she did) in order to decide the issues before her.  Having reviewed the transcript and the Award, I am satisfied that she acted fairly.
Ground 3: approach to issues
The Claimants say the arbitrator took an inappropriate approach in the Final Award in that, at least:
she failed to identify the weight she had given to the Claimants’ evidence;
contrary to the rule in Hollington v Hewthorn [1943] KB 587, she relied on findings made about the Claimants’ credibility as witnesses in the Judgment and in the Thai proceedings, rather than carrying out her own evaluation; and
she failed, adequately or at all, to address all the disputes of fact and law on the parties’ respective evidence in explaining how she had come to her conclusions.
As an example of (i)/(iii) above, the Claimants say their evidence was that the other members of WEH’s board, and its legal representatives, were made aware of the LOI and the fact that payments had been made pursuant to it to the Claimants’ lawyers in relation to the Litigation.  They complain that the arbitrator appears to have ignored this evidence, and to have accepted Ms Asiano’s evidence unquestioningly, despite the serious concerns raised about her by the Claimants.
However, as Teare J said in UMS Holding Ltd v Great Station Properties SA [2017] EWHC 2398 (Comm), [2018] Bus LR 650 (after reviewing the case law):
… A contention that the tribunal has ignored or failed to have regard to evidence relied upon by one of the parties cannot be the subject matter of an allegation of a serious irregularity within section 68(2)(a) or (d), for several reasons. First, the tribunal's duty is to decide the essential issues put to it for decision and to give its reasons for doing so. It does not have to deal in its reasons with each point made by a party in relation to those essential issues or refer to all the relevant evidence. Second, the assessment and evaluation of such evidence is a matter exclusively for the tribunal. The court has no role in that regard. Third, where a tribunal in its reasons has not referred to a piece of evidence which one party says is crucial the tribunal may have (i) considered it, but regarded it as not determinative, (ii) considered it, but assessed it as coming from an unreliable source, (iii) considered it, but misunderstood it or (iv) overlooked it. There may be other possibilities. Were the court to seek to determine why the tribunal had not referred to certain evidence it would have to consider the entirety of the evidence which was before the tribunal and which was relevant to the decision under challenge. Such evidence would include not only documentary evidence but also the transcripts of factual and expert evidence. Such an enquiry (in addition to being lengthy, as it certainly would be in the present case) would be an impermissible exercise for the court to undertake because it is the tribunal, not the court, that assesses the evidence adduced by the parties. Further, for the court to decide that the tribunal had overlooked certain evidence the court would have to conclude that the only inference to be drawn from the tribunal's failure to mention such evidence was that the tribunal had overlooked it. But the tribunal may have had a different view of the importance, relevance or reliability of the evidence from that of the court and so the required inference cannot be drawn. Fourth, section 68 is concerned with due process. Section 68 is not concerned with whether the tribunal has made the ""right"" finding of fact, any more than it is concerned with whether the tribunal has made the ""right"" decision in law. The suggestion that it is a serious irregularity to fail to deal with certain evidence ignores that principle. By choosing to resolve disputes by arbitration the parties clothe the tribunal with jurisdiction to make a ""wrong"" finding of fact.”
And similarly, as regards the expression of an arbitrator’s reasons for their award:
… the duty to act fairly imposed by section 33 does not require the tribunal to refer in its award to all of the evidence regarded by the losing party as key or to deal with all of the submissions made in relation to the evidence but simply, in the language of section 52(4) , to set out ""the reasons for the award"". All that can be said is that such an approach to writing the reasons for an award is different from the current practice of the courts when writing judgments. It is true that where the evidence alleged to be key by the losing party is not referred to by the tribunal that party may sometimes be left in doubt as to what the tribunal thought of that evidence, but in circumstances where the parties have agreed that their chosen tribunal is the sole judge of fact they cannot expect the court to review the evidence in order to form a view as to whether, as is likely to be the case, the tribunal has regarded the evidence as unhelpful (for one or more reasons) or, as is unlikely to be the case, the tribunal has ignored or overlooked the evidence. As was noted by the DAC in its report (paragraph 280) ""the test is not what would have happened had had the matter been litigated. To apply such a test would be to ignore the fact that the parties have agreed to arbitrate, not litigate."" Were the court able to scrutinise the content or quality of a tribunal's reasons the court would have something akin to a general supervisory jurisdiction over arbitrations which it does not have. Such scrutiny would frustrate one of the principal purposes of the Arbitration Act 1996 which was, as explained in Lesotho, to limit the court's intervention in arbitration. As Tomlinson J. said in ABB AG v Hochtief Airport, at paragraph 80, a tribunal's reasons may be ""unsatisfactory"" but that is not a serious irregularity within section 68. ""It is not for this court to tell an international commercial tribunal how to set out its award or the reasons therefor.""”
See also Islamic Republic of Pakistan v Broadsheet LLC [2019] EWHC 1832 (Comm), [2019] Bus LR 2753 at [40].
The arbitrator in the present case set out the reasons for her Award in clear, detailed and sufficient terms.
Whilst the arbitrator cited among other things the findings made about the Claimants’ credibility by Calver J and in the Thai proceedings, she expressly recognised that she was not bound by them (Award § 93), and made her own findings about them and about the issues before her.  Section D of the Award, comprising paragraphs 82 to 122, sets out in detail the arbitrator’s reasoning and conclusions about the LOI.   Moreover (as to the Hollington v Hewthorn point), section 34 of the Act provides that an arbitrator is entitled to determine procedural and evidential matters including “whether to apply strict rules of evidence (or any other rules) as to the admissibility, relevance or weight of any material”.
CONCLUSION
For all these reasons, I find no merit in the Claimants’ claim.  The challenge to the Award must be dismissed.

LUTON BOROUGH COUNCIL
Respondent
Decision: The appeal is struck out under Rule 8(3)(a) of The Tribunal Procedure (First-tier Tribunal) (General Regulatory Chamber) Rules 2009 (“the Rules”).
REASONS
The Appellant lodged an appeal using the GRC1 form with the Tribunal on 8 May 2024. The appeal was incomplete because the Appellant did not include with the appeal a copy of the decision they are seeking to challenge.
Rule 22(3) of the Rules provides that if the proceedings challenge a decision, the Appellant must provide with the notice of appeal a copy of any written record of that decision, and any statement of reasons for that decision that the Appellant has or can reasonably obtain.
Case Management Directions dated 30 July 2024 directed the Appellant to provide a copy of the decision they sought to challenge by 14 August 2024.
The Appellant failed to comply with the directions.
Case Management Directions dated 15 October 2024 directed the Appellant to provide to the Tribunal the decision of the Respondent they sought to challenge. It was explained that the decision was likely to be a letter sent to the Appellant .
The Appellant was directed to provide the decision by no later than 29 October 2024. The Appellant was told that if the letter was not provided the appeal would be struck out for not complying with the direction and no further directions would be sent.
The Appellant has failed to comply with the Case Management Directions of 15 October 2024.
In an email dated 30 July 2024, the Appellant indicated that she was confused about what was required.
I am satisfied that the Case Management Directions dated 15 October 2024 made clear to the Appellant what was required.
There are grounds to strike out the proceedings because the Appellant has failed to comply with a direction which stated that failure by the Appellant to comply with the direction could lead to the striking out of the proceedings.
The Appellant may apply for the proceedings to be reinstated under Rules 8(5) and (6) of the Rules. The application must be in writing and be received by the Tribunal within 28 days after the date on which this Decision is issued.

The Appellant is a registered tobacco and nicotine vapour product retail business. Three Fixed Penalty Notices (“FPN”) was issued to the Appellant for offences under the Act which took place on 4 and 5 June 2024. The FPNs relate to a criminal offence committed by the Appellant. The FPN remain outstanding and there is a pending application to the Sheriff Court.
Muhammad Umer Shahbaz, on behalf of the Appellant, in representations submits that the First-tier Tribunal does have jurisdiction under Schedule 10 paragraph 5 of the Consumer Rights Act 2015 (“CRA”).
Schedule 10 concerns the imposition of financial penalties relating to secondary ticketing and is relevant only to a breach of a duty imposed by Chapter 5 of Part 3 of the CRA which has no connection to the Act under which the FPN were issued in this case and provides no jurisdiction for appeal to the First-tier Tribunal.
The Appellant asserts that the Tribunal should issue CMD under the powers contained in Rule 5(3)(k) of the Rules. The Tribunal has no jurisdiction in this matter and it is not appropriate in those circumstances to transfer the proceedings to another court or tribunal. The FPN were issued for a criminal offence for which the Sheriff Court has jurisdiction.

.............................
SIR ANDREW McFARLANE P:
This is the judgment of the Court, to which all three members have contributed.
The single question of law at the centre of this appeal is whether the court has any jurisdiction to set aside a validly made order for the adoption of a child, other than by way of an appeal. If the central question is answered in the affirmative, then subsidiary issues will arise as to the manner and basis upon which that jurisdiction should be exercised.
The issue is one of importance. It is plainly important to the children at the centre of this appeal, their adopter and their natural mother. They, in common, sadly, with a cohort of adoptive families, have experienced adoption breakdown with the result that it is now said to be in the interests of the children for the adoption order to be set aside. It is, however, an issue that is also important in policy terms. The unique attribute of an adoption order, in contrast to any other order that may be made for the welfare of a child, is that it is ‘for life’ and, in common with the legal relationship established at birth, can only be extinguished by the making of a subsequent adoption order. If the court does have jurisdiction to set aside a validly made adoption order where, subsequently, it is held to be in the child’s best interests to do so, then the ability to achieve permanence, security and stability for all adopted children may be compromised.
The appeal is from an order of Mrs Justice Lieven (Re X and Y (Revocation of Adoption Orders) [2024] EWHC 1059 (Fam)). The applicant [‘AM’], who is the single adoptive mother of two children, X and Y, aged 17 and 16 at the time of the hearing before the judge, had applied to revoke the adoption orders, which had been made in 2013. The revocation application was supported by both children, who were held to be Gillick competent, and by their natural mother [‘BM’]. Lieven J held that the court lacked jurisdiction to set aside an adoption order solely on grounds relating to the adopted child’s welfare. She therefore concluded that she had no power to revoke the adoption orders on welfare grounds, and must, therefore, refuse the application.
The adoptive mother’s appeal is supported by the children and their natural mother. As originally constituted, there was, thus, no voice to be heard in opposition. For that reason, and because part of the appellant’s case sought a declaration of incompatibility under Human Rights Act 1998, s 3 and, further, because of the clear policy implications raised by the issue, the court invited the Secretary of State for Education [‘the SoS’] (as the government department responsible for adoption policy) to intervene. We are very grateful to the SoS for taking up that invitation and contributing fully to the appeal proceedings.
Adoption in England and Wales is entirely a creature of statute. The statutory scheme contained within the Adoption and Children Act 2002 [‘ACA 2002’] does not include an express provision permitting a court to revoke an adoption order on welfare grounds. The law reports contain a number of instances where the Court of Appeal has set aside an adoption order on appeal, on some occasions a very significant time after the order had been made. Since 2013, there have also been a small number of first instance decisions in the High Court where an application to set aside an adoption order has been granted on solely welfare grounds. It will be necessary to look at each of these decisions in some detail to determine whether they do establish the existence of the jurisdiction that the appellant and those supporting the appeal now rely upon.
The Factual Context
The factual background to this application was set out in some detail by Lieven J at paragraphs 5 to 25 of her judgment. In summary the essential factual elements are:
X and Y were placed with AM in August 2012. They were then just over 5 and 4 years old. They had previously spent a prolonged period in foster care, during which they had had significant contact with their birth mother, BM;
The children did not settle well and asked for continuing contact with BM. AM agreed to them spending time with BM and her extended family and the children became more settled;
In 2017-19, X expressed a wish to live with BM, whereas Y was clear that she wanted to remain with AM;
BM had a third child who, after a period with his maternal grandmother, went to live with BM. BM then had two more children, whom she has cared for throughout their lives;
In 2020, during the Covid lockdown, AM allowed BM and her youngest children to move in for a period to live with her, X and Y in the adoptive home to help BM to escape from an abusive relationship;
In August 2021, X and Y left AM’s home and eventually moved to live with BM;
In May 2022, X, who had by then been introduced to her birth father, moved to live with him;
In February 2023, the local authority issued care proceedings. Y told the children’s guardian that she wanted to stay with BM and did not want AM to continue to have parental responsibility for her. X wanted to live with her birth father, but to maintain a relationship with AM;
In April 2023, AM made the present application to revoke the adoption orders;
In May 2023, child arrangement orders were made for Y to live with BM and for X to live with her birth father under CA 1989, s 8. A one year supervision order was made to the local authority;
X’s placement with her birth father subsequently broke down and she spent time living with BM and then AM before settling back with BM.
Before Lieven J, in April 2024, X’s position, which had been that she no longer wanted to be ‘unadopted’, changed to supporting the application and wanting to remain with BM. Y maintained the position that she had consistently held for some time, which was to support AM’s application and to be ‘unadopted’.
Although, following a thorough review of the relevant authorities, Lieven J held that the court lacked jurisdiction to revoke an adoption on purely welfare grounds, she went on to record her assessment in terms of the welfare of X and Y at paragraph 94:
“I do however wish to note, that I accept, certainly in the case of Y, it would be in her best interests to revoke the order. She plainly finds the present legal fiction distressing and the fact that it reflects neither reality nor her own sense of self, deeply upsetting. This has been her position consistently for a long period. The position is less clear cut in respect of X. I do not intend to carry out a detailed analysis of her welfare interests given that I have found I have no power to revoke.”
The statutory scheme
In order to understand the statutory structure, and the legislative force, that lies behind an adoption order, it is necessary to consider the key provisions of ACA 2002.
X and Y, in common with many children who are adopted from the care system, were made subject to orders under CA 1989, s 31 placing them in the care of another local authority. By a separate order, that local authority was authorised to place them for adoption under ACA 2002, s 21:
‘21 Placement orders
A placement order is an order made by the court authorising a local authority to place a child for adoption with any prospective adopters who may be chosen by the authority.
The court may not make a placement order in respect of a child unless—
the child is subject to a care order,
the court is satisfied that the conditions in section 31(2) of the 1989 Act (conditions for making a care order) are met, or
the child has no parent or guardian.
The court may only make a placement order if, in the case of each parent or guardian of the child, the court is satisfied—
that the parent or guardian has consented to the child being placed for adoption with any prospective adopters who may be chosen by the local authority and has not withdrawn the consent, or
that the parent’s or guardian’s consent should be dispensed with.
This subsection is subject to section 52 (parental etc. consent).
A placement order continues in force until—
it is revoked under section 24,
an adoption order is made in respect of the child, or
the child marries, forms a civil partnership or attains the age of 18 years.’
ACA 2002, s 21 provides that a placement order may only be made where the ‘significant harm’ threshold criteria in CA 1989, s 31 for the making of a care order are satisfied (or the child has no parent or guardian), and where each parent or guardian with parental responsibility consents or where that parent’s consent should be dispensed with under ACA 2002, s 52.
ACA 2002, s 52(1) provides:
‘52 Parental etc. consent
The court cannot dispense with the consent of any parent or guardian of a child to the child being placed for adoption or to the making of an adoption order in respect of the child unless the court is satisfied that—
the parent or guardian cannot be found or lacks capacity (within the meaning of the Mental Capacity Act 2005) to give consent, or
the welfare of the child requires the consent to be dispensed with.’
ACA 2002, s 52 is subject to s 1 which requires the court to afford paramount consideration to the welfare of the child ‘throughout his life’ [s 1(2)]:
‘1 Considerations applying to the exercise of powers
Subsections (2) to (4) apply whenever a court or adoption agency is coming to a decision relating to the adoption of a child.
The paramount consideration of the court or adoption agency must be the child’s welfare, throughout his life.
The court or adoption agency must at all times bear in mind that, in general, any delay in coming to the decision is likely to prejudice the child’s welfare.
The court or adoption agency must have regard to the following matters (among others)—
the child’s ascertainable wishes and feelings regarding the decision (considered in the light of the child’s age and understanding),
the child’s particular needs,
the likely effect on the child (throughout his life) of having ceased to be a member of the original family and become an adopted person,
the child’s age, sex, background and any of the child’s characteristics which the court or agency considers relevant,
any harm (within the meaning of the Children Act 1989 (c. 41)) which the child has suffered or is at risk of suffering,
the relationship which the child has with relatives, with any person who is a prospective adopter with whom the child is placed, and with any other person in relation to whom the court or agency considers the relationship to be relevant, including—
the likelihood of any such relationship continuing and the value to the child of its doing so,
the ability and willingness of any of the child’s relatives, or of any such person, to provide the child with a secure environment in which the child can develop, and otherwise to meet the child’s needs,
the wishes and feelings of any of the child’s relatives, or of any such person, regarding the child.
…
In coming to a decision relating to the adoption of a child, a court or adoption agency must always consider the whole range of powers available to it in the child’s case (whether under this Act or the Children Act 1989); and the court must not make any order under this Act unless it considers that making the order would be better for the child than not doing so.’
There is a deal of authority on the meaning of the phrase in s 52(1)(a): ‘the welfare of the child requires the consent to be dispensed with’. In particular:
Re P (Placement Orders: Parental Consent) [2008] EWCA Civ 535, [2008] All ER (D) 265 (May), [2008] 2 FLR 625;
Re B (Care Proceedings: Appeal) [2013] UKSC 33, [2013] All ER (D) 103 (Jun), [2013] 2 FLR 1075;
Re B-S (Adoption: Application of s 47(5)) [2013] EWCA Civ 1146, [2013] All ER (D) 145 (Sep), [2014] 1 FLR 1035;
Re R [2014] EWCA Civ 1625, [2014] All ER (D) 179 (Dec), [2015] 1 FLR 715.
It is not necessary to rehearse those matters here, save to record that the test for dispensing with consent is not undertaken by applying an ordinary welfare balance. The court must be satisfied that the child’s welfare requires adoption, as opposed to any other lesser arrangement. After a full welfare evaluation of all of the pros and cons, undertaken in a holistic rather than linear manner, the court must consider that the highest level of intervention, namely adoption, is proportionate and necessary to meet the particular child’s welfare needs.
Reference to adoption being the highest level of intervention is justified by reference to the statutory definition of an adoption order in ACA 2002, s 47:
‘46 Adoption orders
An adoption order is an order made by the court on an application under section 50 or 51 giving parental responsibility for a child to the adopters or adopter.
The making of an adoption order operates to extinguish—
the parental responsibility which any person other than the adopters or adopter has for the adopted child immediately before the making of the order,
any order under the 1989 Act or the Children (Northern Ireland) Order 1995,
any order under the Children (Scotland) Act 1995 (c. 36) other than an excepted order, and
(ca) any child assessment order or child protection order within the meaning given in section 202(1) of the Children’s Hearing (Scotland) Act 2011,
any duty arising by virtue of an agreement or an order of a court to make payments, so far as the payments are in respect of the adopted child’s maintenance or upbringing for any period after the making of the adoption order.
“Excepted order” means an order under section 9, 11(1)(d) or 13 of the Children (Scotland) Act 1995 or an exclusion order within the meaning of section 76(1) of that Act.
An adoption order—
does not affect parental responsibility so far as it relates to any period before the making of the order, and
in the case of an order made on an application under section 51(2) by the partner of a parent of the adopted child, does not affect the parental responsibility of that parent or any duties of that parent within subsection (2)(d).
Subsection (2)(d) does not apply to a duty arising by virtue of an agreement—
which constitutes a trust, or
which expressly provides that the duty is not to be extinguished by the making of an adoption order.
An adoption order may be made even if the child to be adopted is already an adopted child.
Before making an adoption order, the court must consider whether there should be arrangements for allowing any person contact with the child; and for that purpose the court must consider any existing or proposed arrangements and obtain any views of the parties to the proceedings.’
The status conferred by an adoption order is established by ACA 2002, s 67:
‘67 Status conferred by adoption
An adopted person is to be treated in law as if born as the child of the adopters or adopter.
An adopted person is the legitimate child of the adopters or adopter and, if adopted by—
a couple, or
one of a couple under section 51(2),
is to be treated as the child of the relationship of the couple in question.
An adopted person—
if adopted by one of a couple under section 51(2), is to be treated in law as not being the child of any person other than the adopter and the other one of the couple, and
in any other case, is to be treated in law, subject to subsection (4), as not being the child of any person other than the adopters or adopter;
but this subsection does not affect any reference in this Act to a person’s natural parent or to any other natural relationship.
In the case of a person adopted by one of the person’s natural parents as sole adoptive parent, subsection (3)(b) has no effect as respects entitlement to property depending on relationship to that parent, or as respects anything else depending on that relationship.
This section has effect from the date of the adoption.
Subject to the provisions of this Chapter and Schedule 4, this section—
applies for the interpretation of enactments or instruments passed or made before as well as after the adoption, and so applies subject to any contrary indication, and
has effect as respects things done, or events occurring, on or after the adoption.
In contrast to a placement order, which may be revoked under ACA 2002, s 24, the 2002 Act does not make any provision for the revocation of an adoption order save in the rare circumstances where a child adopted by one natural parent as sole adoptive parent subsequently becomes a legitimated person on the marriage of, or formation of a civil partnership by, the natural parents [ACA 2002, s 55] or where the child is subsequently made the subject of a further adoption order [s 46(5)].
The following integral elements in the statutory scheme make it plain that adoption is to be reserved for cases where the welfare of the child requires intervention so as to remove the child from their birth family, but that, where such intervention is necessary then the removal, as a matter of law, is intended to be life-long and intended to extinguish, in legal terms, natural family relationships so that it is as if the adopted child had been born to their adopter:
The court’s determination is to be based on ‘the child’s welfare throughout his life’ [s 1(1)];
The court must have regard to ‘the likely effect on the child (throughout his life) of having ceased to be a member of the original family and become an adopted person’ [s 1(4)(c)];
A child may only be placed by a local authority under a placement order where the circumstances would justify the making of a care order and where the requirements regarding parental consent are satisfied [s 21(2)+(3)];
Parental consent may only be dispensed with where the welfare of the child ‘requires’ adoption (as opposed to any lesser intervention), applying s 1 and considering welfare ‘throughout his life’ [s 52];
An adopted person ‘is to be treated in law as if born as the child of the adopters or adopter’ [s 67(1)], ‘is the legitimate child of the adopters or adopter’ [s 67(2)] and ‘is to be treated in law … as not being the child of any person other than the adopters or adopter’ [s 67(3)(b)];
Parliament has made no provision for the revocation of an adoption order, other than following legitimation or the making of a subsequent adoption order [s 55 and s 46(5) (see below)].
In cases that do not involve adoption, there is no legal mechanism by which natural parents or children can extinguish the parental bond between them, however much they may wish to do so. The statutory scheme replicates this state of affairs in respect of adoptive parents and adopted children. The only gateway out of a legal parent/child relationship is adoption. In this context, it is to be noted that in ACA s 46(5) Parliament has made express provision for an adoption order to be made even if the child to be adopted is already an adopted child.
For completeness, it has long been recognised that there is a significant, qualitative, difference between adoption and any other arrangements by which a child may be looked after by those other than his/her parents. Some 40 years ago, in Re H (Adoption: Parental Agreement) (1982) 3 FLR 386, Ormrod LJ answered the question ‘What do the adoptive parents gain by an adoption order over and above what they have already got on a long-term [fostering] basis?’. He said:
“To that the answer is always the same – and it is always a good one – adoption gives us total security and makes the child part of our family and places us in parental control of the child; long-term fostering leaves us exposed to changes of view of the local authority, it leaves us exposed to applications, and so on by the natural parent. That is a perfectly sensible and reasonable approach; it is far from being only an emotive one.”
That passage was quoted with approval by Lord Ackner in the House of Lords in Re C (A Minor) (Adoption Order: Conditions) [1988] 2 FLR 159 at 168G.
More recently, in Re V (Long-Term Fostering or Adoption) [2013] EWCA Civ 913, Black LJ offered a non-exhaustive list of the material differences between long-term fostering and adoption, drawing particular attention to the contrasting degree of security that the two models offer. The list [at paragraph 96] included:
Adoption makes the child a permanent part of the adoptive family to which he or she fully belongs. To the child, it is likely, therefore, to ‘feel’ different from fostering. Adoptions do, of course, fail but the commitment of the adoptive family is of a different nature to that of a local authority foster carer whose circumstances may change, however devoted he or she is, and who is free to determine the caring arrangement.
Whereas the parents may apply for the discharge of a care order with a view to getting the child back to live with them, once an adoption order is made, it is made for all time.”
Lieven J’s Judgment
The legal case on jurisdiction was fully argued before this court and we will, shortly, turn to our analysis of the decided cases. In those circumstances, and whilst paying full respect to the judge for her careful review of the law, it is not necessary to do more than summarise the approach taken to the issues of law by Lieven J.
The primary submission on behalf of the appellant at first instance was that the court had a power under its inherent jurisdiction to revoke the orders. Reliance was placed upon a number of High Court decisions, commencing with that of Bodey J in Re W (Inherent Jurisdiction: Permission Application: Revocation and Adoption Order) [2013] EWHC 1957 (Fam). An alternative ground was also advanced that a power to revoke existed under Matrimonial and Family Proceedings Act 1984, s 31F(6):
‘31F Proceedings and decisions
The family court has power to vary, suspend, rescind or revive any order made by it, including—
power to rescind an order and re-list the application on which it was made,
power to replace an order which for any reason appears to be invalid by another which the court has power to make, and
power to vary an order with effect from when it was originally made.’
Lieven J was not satisfied that the court had the power to revoke an adoption order on the sole basis of the adopted person’s welfare. She concluded that the statute clearly only permits revocation in one circumstance, namely legitimation. The judge did, however, accept that there is a power to revoke or set aside an adoption order under the inherent jurisdiction, but she distinguished the circumstances of the present application, which was based solely on welfare interests, as opposed to other cases that have been based on procedural irregularity. Lieven J held that the inherent jurisdiction cannot be used to “cut across” the statutory scheme to achieve an outcome which was clearly contrary to Parliament’s intention to restrict the very narrow circumstances in which an adoption order can be revoked.
The parties had submitted that the present case was of an exceptional nature sufficient to justify the court intervening. Lieven J did not consider that that argument was made out in the light of the increase in breakdown of adoption placements in recent years, with some basic statistics indicating that between 4% and 9% breakdown each year.
Finally, Lieven J decidedly rejected the applicant’s alternative submission based on MFPA 1984, s 31F(6) as being applicable to adoption orders stating (at paragraph 90) that:
“It would have been little short of extraordinary for Parliament to have introduced a power to revoke adoption orders, with no limitations or process, without including any further provisions.”
On that basis, Lieven J refused the application to revoke the adoption orders.
The Appeal
We are extremely grateful to counsel for the clarity of their written and oral submissions. Those submissions have formed the basis of our in-depth review of each of the relevant cases. It is not necessary, and would be potentially confusing, to take space here in summarising what each counsel submitted with respect to each of these authorities. Without any disrespect to the thoroughness of the submissions, we will do no more at this stage than summarise the key points that were made.
There was a degree of common ground between all parties upon the policy considerations identified by Ms Louise MacLynn KC and Mr Tom Wilson for the SoS:
A central tenet of the legislative scheme for adoption is that the making of an adoption order, unlike any other order in Family proceedings relating to children, is ‘definitive and final’;
It has a ‘transformative effect’ which is quite different to almost any other order and treats the child as if born to the adopter in circumstances where the order may only be revoked under s 55 or by subsequent adoption [s 46(5)];
Powerful policy considerations militate away from any measure which dilutes or undermines the finality and certainty of an adoption order, which is intended to be final and for life;
The purpose of an adoption order is to effect a permanent transfer of parental status, regardless of subsequent events.
For the appellant, Ms Deirdre Fottrell KC (who did not appear below), leading Mr Dorian Day and Ms Samantha Smith (who did), focussed the appeal upon the following basis:
Despite the strong policy context identified by the SoS, the High Court has accepted that the court does have power to revoke an adoption order under the inherent jurisdiction, albeit that the law sets a very high bar for doing so;
Central to AM’s case is the ‘necessity’ for the court to correct the legal fiction which is said to exist where the de facto parent of these two young people is, once again, their birth mother. Lieven J was wrong in her analysis of when and how the power under the inherent jurisdiction should be exercised;
The circumstances in which the power may be exercised are narrow and fact-dependent. Their existence does not of itself offend the compelling public policy considerations as to the transformative nature of adoption;
Neither the High Court nor the Court of Appeal has excluded ‘welfare’ as a consideration to be taken into account when determining an application to revoke adoption, albeit that welfare will not be the paramount consideration.
The approach taken by Lieven J in holding that it would only be in an ‘exceptional’ case that the court might exercise jurisdiction to set aside was in error. Where, as here, there is, it is said, ‘a legal contrivance’ (namely the continuing adoption order) which runs contrary to the child’s welfare, this should not be tolerated.
At the hearing, the appellant no longer pursued the claim that the relevant provisions of ACA 2002 are not compatible with ECHR, Art 8.
For the local authority, Mr Nick Brown (who appeared below), supported the appeal and argued that the ACA 2002 did not establish a comprehensive statutory scheme regarding revocation. The courts had been justified in developing a jurisdiction to revoke orders under the High Court’s inherent jurisdiction. That development had been principled and legitimate. Mr Brown submitted that there was a pressing and developing social need not to see young people ‘trapped in a legal fiction’, which he submitted was the position of Y in this case.
By a Respondent’s Notice the local authority sought to uphold the judge’s decision not to revoke the adoption order with respect to X, but for reasons other than those of the judge (lack of jurisdiction), namely on welfare grounds.
For BM, Mr Andrew Norton KC (who did not appear below), leading Ms Elisabeth Richards (who did), fully supported the submissions made by Ms Fottrell and, on paper, by the SoS. He submitted that this court had sufficient information to make the welfare evaluation necessary to support revocation of Y’s adoption order, but might have to remit the case of X for further consideration.
In her skeleton argument for the SoS, Ms MacLynn summarised what she described, on instructions, as ‘a continuing public policy imperative of the utmost importance that the finality and integrity of a properly made adoption order be protected’. We regard the propositions underpinning the SoS’s position as important and therefore repeat them in full:
Adoption legislation, including that which preceded the ACA 2002, has been drafted in clear and unequivocal terms to ensure that an adoption order creates a complete, life-long, and irreversible transfer of parental status.
The Secretary of State considers that it remains the case that it will ‘gravely damage the lifelong commitment of adopters to their adoptive children’ if there is a possibility of the child or the birth parents seeking to challenge the finality of an adoption order.  That could lead to a public perception that adoption is reversible and a less serious undertaking than biological parenting and risks diminishing the value and importance of adoption as a means of providing a permanent family to children in care.
The research is consistent that one of the central factors relevant to the success of an adoptive placement is the stability of the adoptive family relationships and the commitment of the adoptive parents to the child.
The Secretary of State also considers that any measure which weakens or undermines the finality and certainty of an adoption order risks deterring potential prospective adopters from seeking to adopt a child.
The long-established public policy considerations must be viewed through a modern lens. Open adoptions, involving post-adoption contact between the child and their birth family, are increasingly common and are largely considered to be in a child’s best interests. However, such arrangements inevitably rely on adoptive parents having the confidence in the stability of their legal and familial relationship with the child, which may be undermined if the finality of adoption is weakened.
Similarly, in the era of social media, it is increasingly likely that an adopted child, whether in the context of an adoption breakdown or not, will be able to make contact with their birth family. Again, the finality and certainty of the adoptive family relationships will be central to managing any such contact.”
The SoS’s written position had been that she did not seek to argue that a power to revoke under the inherent jurisdiction does not, or should not, exist to be exercised in ‘highly exceptional and very particular circumstances’. It was submitted that, by excluding even exceptional circumstances, Lieven J had adopted an improperly narrow interpretation of the caselaw, in particular Webster v Norfolk County Council (see below).
By the time that Ms MacLynn addressed the court, as the final advocate to do so, a line of distinction had begun to be identified during the hearing between cases where an adoption order had been set aside on appeal, and other cases where revocation had been ordered at first instance. She told the court that the SoS would not argue against the jurisdiction being limited to cases on appeal.
For Y, Mr Timothy Bowe KC and Mr Mark Cooper-Hall (who both appeared below) strongly submitted that Y was trapped in an identity that she totally rejected. Unless the adoption order were revoked, her status now and in the future would be wholly out of kilter with all of those around her in her family. Y had considered the prospect of being ‘readopted’ by BM, under s 46(5) and, Mr Bowe reported, she was fundamentally opposed to such an outcome.
In her reply, Ms Fottrell submitted that this case was ‘highly exceptional’ because of the operation of law placing AM back as the children’s carer with parental responsibility under the CA 1989, s 8 orders that had been made, yet not being recognised in law as their mother. These facts therefore place the case in the very small category of cases justifying revocation.
The decided cases
By the close of the hearing, it was clear to all three members of the court that it was necessary to look at each of the previously decided cases in turn in order to unpick the basis on which they had been determined and to identify the origin and development of the jurisprudence in favour of there being a free-standing jurisdiction to revoke an adoption order under the inherent jurisdiction of the High Court, rather than upon appeal.
The parties to the appeal agreed that two principal propositions can be extracted from the decided cases. The first is that the High Court has the inherent power (sometimes described as an inherent jurisdiction) to revoke an adoption order, but only in “exceptional and very particular circumstances” (Webster v Norfolk County Council [2009] EWCA Civ 59, [2009] 2 All ER 1156, [2009] 1 FLR 1378 at §149). The second is that neither the High Court, nor this court, has excluded the child’s welfare as a consideration which can be taken into account when determining an application for revocation.
These propositions, although they are agreed and have been accepted in a number of cases, are not correct. In order to explain, it is necessary to revisit the decided cases in some detail.  We were referred to six decisions of this court, eleven later decisions of the High Court, and one more recent decision of this court.
Decisions of the Court of Appeal
Re F (R) (An Infant) [1970] 1 QB 385, [1969] 3 All ER 1101 – CA
An adoption order was made in February 1969 on the basis that the child’s mother could not be found.  When she learned of the order in April 1969, she applied to this court for permission to appeal out of time and for the adoption order to be set aside.  She produced evidence to support her case that all reasonable steps to find her had not been taken.  The court (Salmon, Edmond Davies and Karminski LJJ) extended the time for appealing.  As to that, Salmon LJ stated at 1103B:
“I would like to point out that, in cases of this kind, an extension is not granted lightly. The infant’s interest has to be taken into account, and particularly what has happened since the date when the order was made and the date of the application. I am not laying down any general principle, but if some years had gone by, I think a very exceptional case would have to be made out for the court in its discretion to extend the time; but here we are dealing with a delay of only a few months. So I would grant leave…”
The court then set aside the adoption order and remitted the matter for rehearing. In doing so, Salmon LJ said at 1103H:
“Counsel for the respondents during the course of the argument has contended very persuasively that this court has no power, having regard to the language of the Adoption Act 1958 and the County Court Rules, to do anything except dismiss this appeal. I am afraid that I do not agree with him. As Edmund Davies LJ pointed out to counsel in the course of the argument, it would follow, if he were right, that even though the mother was on her way to the court to protest on the morning when the proceedings were held and had the misfortune to meet with a motor car accident or a train accident which prevented her from arriving and she came the next day, however strong her case was for keeping the infant, she would be debarred for ever. For my part, I am not prepared to accede to that argument. I think that this court has an inherent jurisdiction to remit a case of this kind when the mother has come forward in circumstances such as these, so that the whole of the matter may be reconsidered. We are here dealing with the future of a little child, and that is much too important to depend on any esoteric points of law or practice.”
Concurring, Edmund Davies LJ described this court as having “the inherent power” to rectify the situation that had arisen, while Karminski LJ observed at 1106B:
“The power of this court to hear an appeal on a matter of this kind must depend on its inherent jurisdiction. It would be, in my view, wholly wrong to say that, in a case of this kind, where we are dealing with an infant, this court has no jurisdiction to correct a mishap – I do not say an error – of the kind that has happened here.”
Re F was an appeal out of time. It shows that this court may use its power to extend time for appealing from an adoption order in an exceptional case. It also shows that this court has the power (which it referred to as an inherent jurisdiction) to set aside an adoption order, in that case on the basis of an irregularity in the process by which it was obtained. The decision concerns the powers of this court. It does not relate to the question of whether the High Court has an inherent jurisdiction to revoke an adoption order.
Re M (Minors) (Adoption) [1991] 1 FLR 458 – CA
A divorced father agreed to the adoption of his children by their mother and her husband, and adoption orders were made in February 1988.  At the time of the orders, the mother had advanced cancer, from which she died in May 1988. The children, who were aged 12 and 11 by the time of the appeal in March 1990, wanted to live with their father. The father, with the support of the step-father, applied for permission to appeal out of time.
This court allowed the appeals and set aside the orders.  Glidewell LJ, with whom Stocker LJ and Butler-Sloss LJ agreed, stated at 459:
“In my view this is, as Lady Justice Butler-Sloss said during the course of argument, a classic case of mistake. It is quite clear that the present appellant was wholly ignorant of his former wife’s condition and, had he known of it, he obviously would not have consented to the adoption. That ignorance vitiates his consent and means that it was of no effect. In the absence of that consent it is very doubtful whether the adoption order would have been made. Since it is clearly in the best interests of the children that the adoption order should be set aside, for those reasons, I would extend the time for both these appeals because formally they are separate appeals, and allow both appeals.
I should say as a postscript that this is, if not unique, at the very least a wholly exceptional case. I say that because I do not want the setting aside of this adoption order in these circumstances to be thought of as some precedent for any related set of facts in another case.”
Re M was, like Re F, an appeal out of time from adoption orders that were vitiated by irregularity, in that case a mistake of fact. In deciding whether to allow the appeal out of time, the court inevitably took account of the children’s welfare, but it was not considering the position of the court of first instance. It was careful to emphasise that it did not intend to set a precedent for the revocation of adoption orders in other cases.
Re B (Adoption: Jurisdiction to Set Aside) [1995] Fam 239, [1995] 3 All ER 333, [1995] 3 WLR 40 – CA, affirming Re B (Adoption: Setting Aside) [1995] 1 FLR 1
This was an appeal from a decision of Sir Stephen Brown P. The appellant Mr R, who was born in 1959, was adopted in that year by a Jewish couple. In adulthood, he worked in the Middle East, where he encountered serious difficulties. In 1989, he traced his birth parents and discovered that his father was a Muslim Arab. He applied to set aside the adoption order. His application was refused by Sir Stephen Brown P, who held that the adoption order had been regularly made and had been acted upon throughout the appellant’s minority. In those circumstances the court had no power to set it aside. His decision was affirmed by this court (Sir Thomas Bingham MR, Simon Brown LJ and Swinton Thomas LJ).
On appeal, Mr R argued, relying on Re F and Re M, that the High Court had an inherent power to set aside the adoption order on the basis of a fundamental mistake.
Swinton Thomas LJ rejected this submission. At 337e he stated:
“In my judgment such an application faces insuperable hurdles. An adoption order has a quite different standing to almost every other order made by a court: it provides the status of the adopted child and of the adoptive parents. The effect of an adoption order is to extinguish any parental responsibility of the natural parents. Once an adoption order has been made, the adoptive parents stand to one another and the child in precisely the same relationship as if they were his legitimate parents, and the child stands in the same relationship to them as to legitimate parents. Once an adoption order has been made the adopted child ceases to be the child of his previous parent and becomes the child for all purposes of the adopters as though he were their legitimate child.
There are certain specific statutory provisions for the revocation of an adoption order. Section 52 of the Adoption Act 1976 provides for the revocation of an adoption on legitimation. Section 53 provides for the annulment of overseas adoptions. Those exceptions provide for specific cases. Unlike certain other jurisdictions, there are no other statutory provisions for revoking a validly made adoption order. Parliament could have so provided if it had wished to do so. Accordingly Mr Levy QC is compelled to submit that the court has an inherent power to set aside an adoption order made in circumstances such as these where, as he puts it, the order was made under a fundamental mistake of fact.”
Referring to earlier cases, he observed at 338a:
“I would prefer myself to regard those cases not as cases where the order has been set aside by reason of a procedural irregularity, although that has certainly occurred, but as cases where natural justice has been denied because the natural parent who may wish to challenge the adoption has never been told that it is going to happen. Whether an adoption order can be set aside by reason of fraud which is unrelated to a natural parent's ignorance of the proceedings was not a subject which was relevant to the present appeal.”
At 339d, he listed a number of distinctions between the present case and Re M, one being that that case was an appeal. Referring to the Scottish case of J and J v C's Tutor 1948 SC 636, where adopters believed that they were adopting a healthy child, when the child in fact had a grave disability, he remarked at 340g that:
“There may be many reasons, indeed good reasons, for an adoptive parent or an adoptive child subsequently to regret the adoption order that had previously been made… To allow considerations such as those put forward in this case to invalidate an otherwise properly made adoption order would, in my view, undermine the whole basis on which adoption orders are made, namely that they are final and for life as regards the adopters, the natural parents and the child.”
Simon Brown LJ accepted that there had been a fundamental mistake that went to the very nature of the adoptive placement and that an appeal within a short time of the adoption order being made might well have succeeded. However, asking whether anything could be done 35 years later, he stated at 342b:
“Tempting though it is to come to the aid of this appellant in his plight, I too have reached the clear conclusion that we cannot; that to do so would involve a radical and impermissible distortion of the long-established adoption regime in this country.”
He held that the cases relied on provided no support for the appellant’s case.  In contrast to the present case, they were all appeals.  At 342d he stated that the only ways of challenging adoption orders, save in the narrow circumstances provided for by sections 52 and 53 of the Adoption Act 1976, are by certiorari or appeal (if necessary, by leave to appeal out of time).  At 342j he added that:
“It is, in short, one thing to allow an appeal (even an appeal out of time) on the ground of mistake; quite another to recognise it as a broad general basis of challenge available on judicial review or upon such unique form of process as is now before us. And, indeed, even upon appeal, as this court made very plain in Re M, only rarely will an adoption order be set aside on the ground of mistake: there are, as Swinton Thomas LJ's judgment has made plain, compelling reasons for treating adoption orders as of peculiar finality. Had the appellant's mother discovered the nature of the placement and herself appealed within a short time of the order being made, then, particularly if her appeal was supported by Mr and Mrs R, it might well have succeeded. But today, even supposing (contrary to the fact) that the appellant himself had been a party to the order and thus was entitled to appeal against it, it is inconceivable that any court would now grant him leave to appeal out of time and proceed to discharge the order. Exceptional though this case undoubtedly is and strong though the appellant's grievance, more important still is the integrity of the adoption system: its inviolability must be the ultimate imperative.”
Sir Thomas Bingham MR also emphasised the unique nature of adoption at 343d:
“The act of adoption has always been regarded in this country as possessing a peculiar finality. This is partly because it affects the status of the person adopted, and indeed adoption modifies the most fundamental of human relationships, that of parent and child. It effects a change intended to be permanent and concerning three parties. The first of these are the natural parents of the adopted person, who by adoption divest themselves of all rights and responsibilities in relation to that person. The second party is the adoptive parents, who assume the rights and responsibilities of parents in relation to the adopted person. And the third party is the subject of the adoption, who ceases in law to be the child of his or her natural parents and becomes the child of the adoptive parents.
The Adoption Act 1976, in ss 52 and 53, makes provision for revocation and annulment of adoption orders. It is, however, noticeable that these provisions are very narrowly drawn, and no general challenge is permitted to adoption orders (otherwise than by way of appeal in the usual way).”
At 343h he observed that the courts have been very strict in their refusal to allow adoption orders to be challenged otherwise than by way of appeal. As to that, he continued at 344b:
“An adoption order is not immune from any challenge. A party to the proceedings can appeal against the order in the usual way. The authorities show, I am sure correctly, that where there has been a failure of natural justice, and a party with a right to be heard on the application for the adoption order has not been notified of the hearing or has not for some other reason been heard, the court has jurisdiction to set aside the order and so make good the failure of natural justice. I would also have little hesitation in holding that the court could set aside an adoption order which was shown to have been obtained by fraud.
None of these situations pertains here. No party to the adoption proceedings has at any stage appealed against the order. The order was regularly made, and there was no procedural irregularity of any kind. It is not suggested that any party to the proceedings deliberately misled the court which made the adoption order.”
Referring to Re M, he said at 344f:
“… it does not appear that the members of the Court of Appeal were opening the door to a new and wide-ranging jurisdiction to set aside adoption orders, but were simply showing a measure of indulgence to an appellant seeking an extension of time. In granting that indulgence the court were no doubt alive to the interests of the children, which would in the circumstances described to the court be much better served by revocation of the adoption order. Even so, the court was at pains to emphasise the exceptional nature of the case which had led it to allow the application and the appeal and to discourage reliance on the decision as a precedent. I do not think this decision can properly be treated as modifying in any way the earlier authorities, which were not in any event cited, so far as one can tell from the report. In the end, and much as I would like to help the appellant, I feel that it is impossible to do so without creating a discrepancy between English and Scottish authority, which is in itself highly undesirable in a field such as this, and without a risk of disturbing in a potentially mischievous way the basic assumption upon which the adoption regime is founded in this country.”
This treatment of Re B is comprehensive because it is unquestionably the most relevant case to the present appeal, and because it is binding upon us. It is the only decision of this court to directly consider the question of whether the High Court had an inherent power to revoke an adoption order, and it is strong authority for the proposition that the power did not exist, even in the special circumstances of that case.
For completeness, it is right to note that Re B was decided before the passage of the Human Rights Act 1998. However, the Appellants rightly acknowledge that the European Court of Human Rights has not found the operation of the Adoption and Children Act 2002 to be incompatible with the Convention: see for example Y.C. v. United Kingdom (no. 4547/10), [2012] 2 FLR 332.
Re K (Adoption and Wardship) [1997] 2 FLR 221 – CA
An adoption order was made in 1994 in relation to E, an orphaned baby who had been rescued from the conflict in Bosnia and brought to England. Notice of the proceedings was not given to the child’s state-appointed guardian, or to surviving members of her family. The guardian and the grandfather appealed out of time from the adoption order.  This court allowed the appeal and remitted the adoption application to the High Court.
Having reviewed previous cases, Butler-Sloss LJ stated at 228:
“The law seems to me to be clear that there are cases where a fundamental breach of natural justice will require a court to set an adoption order aside.
I am satisfied that a fundamental injustice occurred to the guardian and, through him, to the natural family, and indeed to E herself since the wider considerations of her welfare were not considered. There was no proper hearing of the adoption application in January 1994, and in my judgment the order cannot stand. The delay, although unfortunate, cannot be laid at the door of those seeking to set the adoption order aside and, balancing the importance of the status of an adoption order against the plethora of procedural irregularities going to the root of the adoption process, the balance tips strongly in favour of setting the order aside. The procedure in this case displays all the characteristics of a fundamental breach of natural justice which, on the facts of this case, cannot be overlooked.”
Re K is another case where it was held on appeal that there had been procedural failings on such a scale as to amount to a fundamental breach of natural justice. It again concerns the powers of this court, and not those of the High Court.
Webster v Norfolk County Council [2009] EWCA Civ 59, [2009] 2 All ER 1156, [2009] 1 FLR 1378 – CA
Three young children were adopted in 2005 after the court found that one of them had suffered fractures and that they were caused by one or both of his parents. The parents then had a fourth child, and during proceedings about him they were permitted to obtain fresh expert evidence about the fractures. That report suggested a non-abusive explanation. In 2008, the parents applied for permission to appeal out of time against the adoption orders and permission to file the report as fresh evidence. Although there had been no rehearing of the medical evidence, this court (Wall LJ, Moore-Bick LJ and Wilson LJ) considered the applications on the premise that the family had been victims of a serious injustice. Nevertheless, permission to appeal and to file fresh evidence was refused.
Giving the leading judgment, Wall LJ emphasised at §18 that the court’s role was limited to deciding the two applications before it. It was not suggested that there was any procedural irregularity or other defect in the adoption proceedings, and the applications proceeded on the basis that the adoption orders were properly and lawfully made (§132).
In a section of his judgment between §145-164, Wall LJ considered whether it was open “to this court” (i.e. the Court of Appeal) to set aside the adoption orders some years after they were made. He reviewed Re F, Re M, Re B and Re K, and concluded at §161 that:
“… they seem to me to reinforce the proposition that adoption orders, validly and regularly obtained, will not be disturbed even if, as in Re B they leave the adopted person denied of a proper ethnic identity.”
He continued at §163 that:
“The question, therefore, is whether or not a substantial miscarriage of justice, assuming that this is what has occurred, is or can be sufficient to enable the adoption orders in the present case to be set aside.”
He concluded that the applications should be dismissed for two reasons.  The first, at §177, was that:
“the adoption orders… were made in good faith on the evidence then available, and… those orders must stand.”
The second was that the further evidence could have been obtained for use at the trial with reasonable diligence: §180.
In the course of his consideration, Wall LJ made these general observations:
“[148] In my judgment,… the public policy considerations relating to adoption, and the authorities on the point—which are binding on this court—simply make it impossible for this court to set aside the adoption orders even if, as Mr and Mrs Webster argue, they have suffered a serious injustice.
[149] This is a case in which the court has to go back to first principles. Adoption is a statutory process. The law relating to it is very clear. The scope for the exercise of judicial discretion is severely curtailed. Once orders for adoption have been lawfully and properly made, it is only in highly exceptional and very particular circumstances that the court will permit them to be set aside.”
Wilson LJ, concurring, considered at §204 that it was far too late for the parents to bring appeals for two reasons. First, because of the interests of the children, who had been in their adoptive homes for almost four years.  Second, because of:
“the vast social importance of not undermining the irrevocability of adoption orders.”
Webster is another case in which this court was considering an application to extend time for appealing. It concerned the functions of the Court of Appeal, and is a further illustration of how reluctant this court has been to extend time for appealing from regularly-made adoption orders. The question of whether the High Court had a power to revoke an adoption order did not arise, and there is consequently no reference in the judgments to the question of whether or not there is an inherent jurisdiction. “The court” to which Wall LJ referred at §149, when speaking of judicial discretion being severely curtailed, and adoption orders only being set aside in highly exceptional and very particular circumstances, was this court, not the High Court. Unfortunately, as we will see below, that distinction has not been understood in a number of later decisions.
Re W (A Child) (Adoption Order: Set Aside and Leave to Oppose) [2010] EWCA Civ 1535, [2011] 1 FLR 2153, [2010] All ER (D) 264 (Nov) – CA
A child, born in 2005 to a mother afflicted by drugs, was removed from her care at the age of two. In 2008, a placement order was made in the Family Proceedings Court and he was placed for adoption in the following year. The mother apparently achieved abstinence and, some time after an adoption application was made, she expressed the wish to recover care of the child. However, notice of the adoption hearing was sent to the wrong address, and in March 2010 a circuit judge made an adoption order.
In April 2010, the mother applied to revoke the placement order, which was not possible once the child had been placed for adoption. In May 2010, she learned of the adoption order and she applied to the circuit judge to set aside the order. In July 2010, that judge transferred the application to the High Court, where a hearing was listed “to determine whether the adoption Order should be set aside and if so whether the Mother should be given leave to oppose an adoption application”.
The hearing took place in September 2010 before Holman J, who had appeared as amicus curiae in Re B. He noted that he was sitting as a first instance judge, and not as an appeal court. He observed that there was no statutory provision for the extremely rare and exceptional situation where a valid adoption order may later be set aside. He considered it to be permissible, pragmatic and consistent with the purpose of the 2002 Act, to set aside the adoption order, with the consequence that the legal position would revert to what it was immediately before that, namely that the placement order would again be in force. He then considered section 47(5) of the 2002 Act and the question of whether leave should be granted to oppose the making of the adoption order. He set aside the adoption order, granted the mother permission to oppose the making of an adoption order and gave directions for the future conduct of the adoption application.
The adopters appealed, and this court (Thorpe LJ, Munby LJ and Coleridge J) allowed the appeal. No submissions were made about the propriety of a first instance judge setting aside an adoption order. Instead the court considered that the adoption order inevitably had to be set aside and focused on the question of whether the judge had been right to grant permission under section 47(5). One sees this in the extempore judgment of Thorpe LJ at §16:
“[16] Standing back for a moment, it seems to me that there are a number of fundamentals that directed or guided the outcome of the case. The first is that the judge, sitting as he was in the county court, had two options. Manifestly the order of HHJ Hallon was so procedurally flawed that it could not stand. It was inevitable that it had to be set aside. If he set that aside and granted the application for permission, then he must have directed a retrial of the adoption application, not, as before, seemingly unopposed, but at the future hearing fully opposed. Alternatively, if he set aside the flawed order but refused the mother's application for permission, it fell to him, sitting as he was in the county court, to make the adoption order afresh, still an unopposed application. Of course we know that the judge took the first of those two courses.”
At §17, he discusses the nature of section 47(5):
“[17] The making of the adoption application in the county court gave the mother a new opportunity, namely to apply for permission to oppose the adoption application. However it cannot be too strongly emphasised that that is an absolute last ditch opportunity and it will only be in exceptionally rare circumstances that adoption orders will be set aside after the making of the care order, the making of the placement order, the placement of the child, and the issue of the adoption order application.”
Thorpe LJ was there referring to the setting aside of adoption orders on appeal. Later, at §21, he described the mother’s ground for setting aside the adoption order as being “of the greatest strength”.  In contrast, her application for permission to apply to set aside the placement order was “short on merit”, and the judge had been wrong to grant it.  In consequence, this court set aside his order and, exercising its own powers, set aside the original adoption order and remade it as at the date of the hearing before the judge.
It is to be noted that the four experienced family judges who sat in Re W all appear to have accepted or assumed the existence of a power of a first instance court to set aside an adoption order on procedural grounds, some months after it had been made. But the court heard no argument about that (the prevailing view being that the adoption order had to be set aside) and the preceding authorities were not cited: only those relating to section 47(5) were considered.
The decisions at first instance
Re PW (Adoption) [2013] 1 FLR 96 (Parker J)
PW was, by an order made by magistrates, adopted at the age of 17 by family friends, and she remained close to them throughout her life. However, at the age of 69, she applied to the High Court for the adoption order to be revoked, claiming that it should not have been made. At the hearing, she conceded that she instead needed to apply for permission to appeal out of time. Parker J conducted a careful review of the authorities, and held at §34 that:
“I am satisfied that the only basis upon which I can undertake this application is by way of appeal. To that the question of delay is crucial. An appeal cannot proceed without an extension of time being given.”
At §45 she continued:
“It is obvious that PW’s whole family, natural and adopted, wants to put things right as they see it but the reality is that this is retrospective and a wish to rewrite history…  Unfortunately, it is not possible to put the clock back.”
She therefore refused to extend time for appealing and dismissed the application for permission to appeal.
G v G (Parental Order: Revocation) [2012] EWHC 1979 (Fam), [2013] 1 FLR 286 (Hedley J)
D was born by surrogacy in January 2011 and lived with the commissioning parents, Mr and Mrs G. In May 2011 a parental order was made after what was later found to be a gravely flawed process, with no parental reporter’s report and no consideration of the statutory conditions. In September 2011 the parents separated and in November 2011, Mr G applied for the order to be set aside, both on procedural grounds and on the basis that Mrs G had been having an affair and had concealed her true intention to raise D as a single parent. Hedley J noted Mrs G’s submission that the matter should have been dealt with by way of an appeal and not by an originating application. He found considerable merit in it, but exercised an original jurisdiction because it was necessary to investigate the evidence, and because the route of appeal and remission was not practicable now that the surrogate mother, SK, had withdrawn her consent: hence a fresh parental order could not be made.
Hedley J reviewed the cases on revoking adoption orders and concluded, at §43-44:
“[43] In the end I have concluded that I should refuse this application. I have done so for four principal reasons. First, given that the parental order is like an adoption order, an order conferring status, there should, so far as is possible, be certainty and clarity and, therefore, the court in considering such an application should be guided by the authorities on revoking adoption orders. There is no statutory power to do so nor any inherent power other than in the sort of circumstances raised in Re M (Minors) (Adoption) and Re K (Adoption and Wardship). The bar is set very high. Secondly, although the court, Mr G and SK, were undoubtedly misled by Mrs G in her silence, both as to the affair and her pessimistic perception of the marriage, that, in my judgment, comes nowhere near the circumstances that existed in Re M (Minors) (Adoption), which in any event was said should not be used as a precedent on its facts, or in Re K (Adoption and Wardship). Thirdly, I do not believe that a revocation of this order is consistent with D’s welfare, indeed if anything it conduces against it. This is in sharp contradistinction to Re M (Minors) (Adoption). Mrs G is the only mother that he has known and his welfare will be undermined if she is deposed from that role. Fourthly, I am satisfied that the court would have reached the same decision as it did, even if all the matters revealed in the Cafcass report had been considered properly by the judge, and I think it more likely than not that such an order would have been made had all the information been disclosed, provided, of course, SK’s consent and Mr G’s application had continued.
[44] I have also concluded that I should not set aside this order for the purposes of protecting the integrity of the court process. My reasons are essentially the third and fourth reasons above, namely welfare and the same outcome. I am also influenced by the fact that on the present position of SK there could not be an effective rehearing of this case on its merits. It follows that whilst I concluded that I have original jurisdiction to entertain this application to revoke a parental order, both on the basis of deception and the seriously flawed process, I have concluded, for the reasons given, that I should refuse the application.”
As can be seen, the circumstances in which Hedley J was prepared to exercise an original jurisdiction were specific to the legal framework for parental orders, under which the consent of the surrogate mother is indispensable. The decision does not support the proposition that the High Court has an original jurisdiction to revoke an adoption order.
Re W (Inherent Jurisdiction: Permission Application: Revocation and Adoption Order) [2013] EWHC 1957 (Fam), [2013] 2 FLR 1609 (Bodey J)
In 2004, an adoption order was made for a four-year-old girl. In 2012, it broke down and she was placed in foster care. The adopters wanted no more to do with her. The local authority took care proceedings and applied for permission to invoke the inherent jurisdiction and for the adoption order to be revoked. At §6, Bodey J recorded that:
“[6] It is common ground (a) that the only statutory ground for revocation of an adoption order under the Adoption and Children Act 2002 is inapplicable here and therefore (b) that the only possible vehicle for revocation would be the inherent jurisdiction of the High Court. It is also accepted that the inherent jurisdiction can be used for revocation, but only in exceptional circumstances.”
For the last two propositions, he relied on Re B at 340g and Webster at §149, but, as we have seen, those cases do not sustain these conclusions. Permission to invoke the inherent jurisdiction was at all events refused, see §12:
“[12] Balancing the advantages and disadvantages, I have come to the clear conclusion that I should refuse leave to invoke the inherent jurisdiction. It is far less likely than likely that a revocation order would ultimately come to be made and the ‘process’ would stir up all the sorts of potential problems at the human level which I have tried to envisage. In short, it is a Pandora’s box and the court should, in my view, only go there if it seems proportionate, necessary and reasonably likely to be ultimately successful. I do not think that the application fulfils those prerequisites.”
PK v Mr and Mrs K [2015] EWHC 2316 (Fam), [2016] 2 FLR 576 (Pauffley J)
PK was adopted at the age of four by Mr and Mrs K. They sent her overseas to carers who abused her. She returned to England at the age of 14 and was reunited with her birth family. She applied for the adoption order to be revoked. The adoptive parents did not appear. Pauffley J applied the legal framework that had been adopted as common ground by Bodey J. She concluded, at §14-15 that:
“[14] Whilst I altogether accept that public policy considerations ordinarily militate against revoking properly made adoption orders and rightly so, instances can and do arise where it is appropriate so to do. This case, it seems to me, falls well within the range of “highly exceptional and very particular” such that I can exercise my discretion to make the revocation order sought.
[15] There are, it seems to me, powerful reasons in favour of revocation. The sole contraindication surrounds the public policy issue.”
She spelled out the welfare reasons at §25-26:
“[25] If I were to decline to revoke the adoption order and refuse to allow PK to change her name back to that of her natural mother, it seems to me that there would be profound disadvantages in terms of her welfare needs. PK would continue to be, in law, the child of Mr and Mrs K. They would have parental responsibility and the legal rights to make decisions about and for her. But there would be considerable, maybe even insuperable, obstacles in the way of them exercising parental responsibility for PK given that they play no part in her life and she wishes to have nothing to do with them.
[26] Moreover, against the background described, there would be emotionally harmful consequences for PK if she were to remain the adopted child of Mr and Mrs K.”
Re O (A Child) (Human Fertilisation and Embryology: Adoption Revocation) [2016] EWHC 2273 (Fam), [2016] 4 WLR 148 (Sir James Munby P)
C1 was born by IVF to a same-sex couple, X and Y. There was a paperwork error, and the couple were erroneously told by the clinic that they needed to adopt the child in order to achieve legal parentage. An adoption order was made by a district judge. Sir James Munby P’s conclusion in this and a number of other cases was that, contrary to what the clinic had advised, the couple had as a matter of law been C1’s legal parents from birth, and he so declared. He then asked at §25-31 whether the court (i.e. the High Court) had the power to revoke the adoption order, and found that it did. At §27, he stated:
“[27] There is no need for me to embark upon any detailed analysis of the case law. For present purposes it is enough to draw attention to a few key propositions: (i) Under the inherent jurisdiction, the High Court can, in an appropriate case, revoke an adoption order. In relation to this jurisdictional issue I unhesitatingly prefer the view shared by Bodey J in In re W (Inherent Jurisdiction: Permission Application: Revocation and Adoption Order), para 6, and Pauﬄey J in PK v K, para 4, to the contrary view of Parker J in In re PW (Adoption), para 1.  (ii) The eﬀect of revoking an adoption order is to restore the status quo ante: see In re W (Adoption Order: Set Aside and Leave to Oppose), paras 11–12. (iii) However, “The law sets a very high bar against any challenge to an adoption order. An adoption order once lawfully and properly made can be set aside ‘only in highly exceptional and very particular circumstances’”: In re C (A Child) (Adoption: Placement Order), para 44, quoting Webster v Norfolk County Council, para 149. As Pauﬄey J said in PK v K, para 14: “public policy considerations ordinarily militate against revoking properly made adoption orders and rightly so.” (iv) An adoption order regularly made, that is, an adoption order made in circumstances where there was no procedural irregularity, no breach of natural justice and no fraud, cannot be set aside either on the ground of mere mistake (In re B (Adoption: Jurisdiction to Set Aside)) or even if there has been a miscarriage of justice (Webster v Norfolk County Council). (v) The fact that the circumstances are highly exceptional does not of itself justify revoking an adoption order. After all, one would hope that the kind of miscarriage of justice exempliﬁed by Webster v Norfolk County Council is highly exceptional, yet the attempt to have the adoption order set aside in that case failed.”
Finally, at §29 and §31:
“[29] The present case is unprecedented, indeed far removed on its facts from any of the previously reported cases. The central fact, even if no one recognised it at the time, is that when Y applied for the adoption order she was already, not merely in fact but also in law, C1’s mother. It follows that the entire adoption process was carried on while everyone, including the District Judge, was labouring under a fundamental mistake, not, as in In re B (Adoption: Jurisdiction to Set Aside), a mistake of fact but a mistake of law, and, moreover, a mistake of law which went to the very root of the adoptive process; indeed, a mistake of law which went to the very root of the need for an adoption order at all. The entire adoption proceeded upon what, in law, was a fundamentally false basis.
…
[31] To make an order revoking the adoption order, as I propose to do, will not merely right a wrong; it will recognise a legal and factual reality and put an end to a legal and factual ﬁction, what Ms Fottrell rightly described as a wholly contrived position. And it will avoid for the future—and this can only be for C1’s welfare, now, into the future and, indeed throughout life—all the damaging consequences to which X, Y and the guardian have drawn attention. As Ms Fottrell put it, C1’s welfare will be better served by restoring the status quo ante and setting aside the adoption order. I agree. I can detect no convincing argument of public policy pointing in the other direction; on the contrary, in this most unusual and highly exceptional case public policy marches in step with justice to X, Y and C1; public policy demands that I make the order which so manifestly is required in C1’s best interests.”
Re O arose from a very specific situation in which the revocation of the adoption order was a formality, albeit an important one.
Re J (A Minor) (Revocation of Adoption Order) [2017] EWHC 2704 (Fam), [2018] 1 FLR 914 (Hayden J)
A child was placed for adoption and an adoption application was made. His mother applied for permission to oppose the making of the order. The matter came before a circuit judge at a first directions hearing, who dismissed the application in a written judgment, but then, inexplicably, went on to make the adoption order. The local authority immediately recognised the error and contacted the judge the next day, and she is described as ‘purporting’ to revoke the adoption order. The matter was referred administratively to Hayden J, apparently before the order was sealed. He revoked the judge’s order, describing it as “a complete aberration”, and observed, at §12-13:
“[12] It strikes me that there are two equally legitimate alternatives here, either to refer the matter to the Court of Appeal or to address it myself in this Court.  The latter course has the obvious attraction of avoiding delay.  Primarily however, I have come to the conclusion that as [the judge’s] purported Revocation Order was outside her powers, thus plainly void and as it was intercepted before being drawn or sealed, consideration of revocation may properly be addressed in the High Court.  On the facts of this case, probably uniquely, I am also satisfied that the Court can and indeed should consider revoking the Order of its own motion.
[13] For the reasons which are set out above, I consider the circumstances in which this adoption order was made are ‘highly exceptional and very particular’ to use Pauffley J’s elegant and succinct phase.  Whilst the Law Reports do not reveal this situation as having occurred before, there are some similarities with Re. K (Adoption & Wardship) [1997] 2 FLR 221. There the Court of Appeal indicated that where an adoption procedure had been fatally flawed, an application to revoke should be made to the High Court.  Here there was, in short, a complete absence of due process and a wholesale abandonment of correct procedure and guidance.  That is a clear basis upon which to consider whether the Order should be revoked.”
Again, the steps taken to remedy the errors in that case were clearly appropriate, though the decision in Re K does not in fact indicate that an application to revoke should be made to the High Court. The court in Re J did not consider the option of correcting the judgment or order under the slip rule (see below).
Re J (Adoption: Appeal) [2018] EWFC 8, [2018] 4 WLR 38, [2018] 2 FLR 519 (Cobb J)
J was the child of teenage parents. When he was five years old, by which time his father had largely dropped out of his life, his mother married an older man. They applied to adopt J, asserting untruthfully that the father’s details and whereabouts were unknown. In 2013, an adoption order was made by magistrates. In 2016, the father tried to resume a relationship with J, and was shocked to learn that he had been adopted. In 2017, he appealed to the High Court. The appeal was not opposed by the mother or step-father, who had by then separated. Cobb J granted permission to appeal out of time, allowed the appeal and set aside the adoption order. During a thorough review of the authorities, he stated, at §26:
“[26] Adoption orders which have been lawfully and properly made will only be set aside in highly exceptional and very particular circumstances, (see Wall LJ in Webster v Norfolk CC & Others [2009] EWCA Civ 59 at [149]).  This can be achieved in one of two ways, either by an appeal, or under the court’s inherent jurisdiction (as to the latter, see for instance Re W (Inherent Jurisdiction: Permission Application: Revocation and Adoption Order) [2013] EWHC 1957 (Fam), and PK v Mr and Mrs K [2015] EWHC 2316 (Fam)). Given the procedural irregularity in the making of the decision under attack, the father rightly chose the appeal route.”
Cobb J set aside the adoption order because the integrity of the order had been materially undermined (§33). After separate consideration, he made an agreed contact order in favour of the father.
Re J was therefore an appeal out of time based on an original procedural error.
ZH v HS (Application to Revoke Adoption Order: Procedure in Non-Agency Adoption Placement) [2019] EWHC 2190 (Fam), [2020] 1 FLR 96 (Theis J)
In 2016, the High Court made an adoption order for T in favour of her aunt and uncle. T’s mother, who had been overseas at the time of the order, arrived in the UK in 2018 and applied for revocation. All parties agreed that the order should be revoked and T should be placed in her care. Theis J found that the adoption order had been the result of a flawed process with numerous errors and omissions.  She followed the approach taken in Re O, and summarised, at §43:
“[43] In the context where the authorities have repeatedly made clear that it is only in exceptional and very particular circumstances that the court will permit the order to be revoked the critical considerations for the court are:
Was the adoption order lawfully and properly made?
The effect of revocation on the affected child.”
Reasons of convenience apart, it is not apparent why the application in that case was dealt with at first instance, rather than by way of an appeal out of time.
HX v A Local Authority and Others (Application to Revoke Adoption Order) [2020] EWHC 1287 (Fam) [2020] All ER (D) 16 (Jun), [2021] 1 FLR 82 (MacDonald J)
A birth father without parental responsibility applied to revoke an adoption order made in 2019 in respect of a child who had been the subject of a placement order, on the basis that he had been unaware of the adoption proceedings. MacDonald J found that the local authority had not taken reasonable steps to ascertain the father’s identity and whereabouts. However, the failures did not represent the type of fundamental breach of natural justice sufficient to justify the revocation of the adoption order.  In an extensive review of the authorities, he read Re B as limiting the inherent jurisdiction (by which he meant the jurisdiction of the High Court) to revoke an adoption order to those cases in which a failure of natural justice has occurred – see §33, and also 38(iii) and (iv):
“38 (iii) Within this context, the court’s discretion under the inherent jurisdiction to revoke a lawfully made adoption order is severely curtailed and can only be exercised in highly exceptional and very particular circumstances.
Those highly exceptional circumstances must comprise more than mistake or misrepresentation or serious injustice and amount to a fundamental breach of natural justice.”
Basing himself on Webster, MacDonald J considered that he was exercising an original jurisdiction, albeit one that he framed narrowly with reference to Re B.
CD v Blackburn and Darwen Borough Council [2020] EWHC 3411 (Fam) (Peel J)
In April 2020, adoption orders were made by a circuit judge for three children who had been subject to placement orders. In July 2020, the birth mother applied to the High Court revoke the orders on the basis that she did not accept the outcome of the care proceedings. Peel J directed himself in accordance with Re O and ZH v HS. He dismissed the mother’s application as being without merit.
An appeal by the mother was dismissed by this court in Re I-A (Children) (Revocation of Adoption Order) [2021] EWCA Civ 1222. Applying the approach summarised in HX and AX v BX, it held that there had been a procedural irregularity when the adoption order was made, but in the circumstances of the case it did not meet the high hurdle of a fundamental breach of natural justice so as to require a court to revoke the order.
Before Peel J, and on appeal, there was no argument about the powers of the High Court to have entertained the mother’s application.
AX v BX (Revocation of Adoption Order) [2021] EWHC 1121 (Fam), [2021] 4 WLR 80, [2022] 1 FLR 759 (Theis J)
A and B, aged 18 and 16 at the time of the judge’s decision, were adopted in 2011. In 2018 they made contact with their birth family and the adoptive placement broke down. They were subject to care proceedings and interim care orders were made. The adoptive parents did not seek their return. A and B applied to revoke the adoption order with the support of their children’s guardian and without opposition from the adoptive parents. Theis J nevertheless carefully considered the court’s powers:
“[33] It is well established that the High Court has, by way of its inherent jurisdiction, power to revoke an adoption order. The circumstances in which a court may revoke a lawfully granted adoption order under the inherent jurisdiction is set out in a number of well-known authorities, both on appeal and at first instance. The authorities disclose no preference as between the use of the inherent jurisdiction or on appeal, save that Cobb J in Re J (Adoption: Appeal) [2018] 2 FLR 519 at paragraph 20 suggested an appeal may be the preferred route where procedural irregularity is the ground for revocation.”
Theis J took the relevant principles from the summary given by Sir James Munby P in Re O and reviewed a number of other authorities, leading to these observations at §77-78.
“[77] The starting point in these applications is the lodestar provided in paragraph 149 in Webster. The position could not be set out more clearly. The court’s discretion under the inherent jurisdiction to revoke a lawfully made adoption order is severely curtailed and can only be exercised in ‘highly exceptional and very particular circumstances’. The permanent and lifelong nature of adoption orders and the very powerful public policy reasons, as articulated in the cases, underpin this rationale. The cases, Webster included, have given examples of when, on the very particular facts of the case, the discretion has and has not been exercised. Obviously, each case is highly fact dependent. In my judgment, there is no exhaustive category of cases where the court may exercise its discretion, although Webster and other cases make it clear the very steep hill that has to be climbed and why.
[78] I also reject the submission that welfare can play no part in the exercise of the court’s discretion. The cases demonstrate it clearly has been to a greater or lesser extent, depending on the circumstances of the case (for example Re M, PK and Re O). That approach is not inconsistent with the provisions in s 1 (7) ACA 2002, which expressly includes welfare considerations in applications to revoke an adoption order. It is not necessary for me to determine whether welfare in the exercise of the court’s inherent jurisdiction should specifically be guided by the statutory framework for welfare as set out in s 1 ACA 2002, although I agree with the submissions that it should not be inconsistent with it.”
Theis J then offered this summary at §80:
“[80] (1) An adoption order is a transformative order that changes the child’s status in a way that is intended to be legally permanent.
Once made the effect of an adoption order is to extinguish any parental responsibility of the natural parents and any continuing legal relationship between the natural parent and the child. By virtue of s 67 ACA 2002 the child is treated in law as if born as the child of the adoptive parent(s).
The only statutory ground for revocation is provided by s 55 ACA 2002 when, pursuant to s 1(7) ACA 2002, the court’s paramount consideration is [the] child’s welfare throughout his life.
There are strong public policy reasons for not permitting the revocation of adoption orders once made based on (i) the intended permanent and lifelong nature of such orders; (ii) the damage to the lifelong commitment of adopters if there was a possibility of challenge to the validity of the order, and (iii) the impact on the availability of prospective adopters if they thought the natural parents could, even in limited circumstances, secure the return of the child after the adoption order was made.
There is jurisdiction to revoke an adoption order under the inherent jurisdiction of the High Court. Any discretion is severely curtailed where an adoption order has been lawfully and properly made and can only be exercised ‘in highly exceptional and very particular circumstances’ (per Webster [149]).
Although each case will turn on its own facts, the highly exceptional circumstances must comprise more than mistake or misrepresentation or serious injustice and amount to matters such as a fundamental breach of natural justice.
Welfare can, in appropriate cases, be taken into account in deciding whether to exercise the court’s discretion where the highly exceptional and particular circumstances of the case justify it (see Re M, Re B, Re PK and Re O). The extent to which it can, or should be taken into account will vary, depending on the circumstances of the particular case.”
The last three paragraphs are the culmination of the High Court’s assertion of an inherent jurisdiction to set aside adoption orders by a process of balancing public policy and welfare considerations. Applying that approach, Theis J revoked the adoption orders. She recognised the strong public policy considerations that normally weighed against revoking properly made adoption orders, but found that there were “compelling highly exceptional and particular circumstances” that supported revocation. The adoption had not turned out as intended and the relationship between the children and the adopters had completely broken down. There would be an adverse psychological and emotional impact on A and B if they remained in a legal fiction, unrelated to their day to day reality. The Article 8 identity rights of A, B, the mother and the adoptive parents were engaged.  The balancing exercise came down firmly in favour of the orders being revoked.
The facts of AX v BX are notably similar to the facts in the present appeal.
Analysis of the authorities
The key authority remains the decision of this court in Re B, which stated that the courts should be strict in their refusal to allow adoption orders to be challenged otherwise than by way of appeal. Nevertheless, that is what had happened at first instance in the decision that came to this court on appeal in Re W, and in nine of the eleven first instance cases, the exceptions being Re PW (Parker J) and Re J (Cobb J). When entertaining applications to revoke adoption orders, the High Court has relied on the dicta of Wall LJ in Webster but, as seen above, those observations did not relate to the powers of the High Court at all. Parker J was therefore correct to hold that the only remedy available to the applicant in Re PW was an application for permission to appeal out of time. The misunderstanding that there is an inherent jurisdiction in the High Court to set aside an adoption order first appears in Re W (Bodey J) and became codified as received wisdom after that, in particular in Re O (Sir James Munby P).
Evidently, the child’s welfare is to be taken into account in deciding whether to grant permission to appeal out of time, but there is no support in Re B for the proposition that adoption orders can be set aside on welfare grounds. On the contrary, the development of the law in that direction has been at odds with the insistence in Re B on the inviolability of regularly made adoption orders as being the ultimate imperative. The requirement for an extension of time for appealing is an important filter in protecting adoption orders from challenge, and it should not be circumvented by the assumption of an original jurisdiction at first instance.
There may nevertheless be very narrow and specific instances in which the High Court finds it necessary to entertain an application to revoke an adoption order, but they will only arise where for some reason an appeal, in or out of time, is not possible. That was the position in G v G (Hedley J), where the special statutory environment of surrogacy made it impracticable to bring an appeal.
There may also be cases, where the failure to serve a party has been so quickly identified that the court, whether the High Court or the Family Court, can correct the position by using its powers under the Family Procedure Rules 2010.  FPR 27.5 provides:
“Application to set aside judgment or order following failure to attend
Where a party does not attend a hearing or directions appointment and the court gives judgment or makes an order against him, the party who failed to attend may apply for the judgment or order to be set aside.
An application under paragraph (1) must be supported by evidence.
Where an application is made under paragraph (1), the court may grant the application only if the applicant –
acted promptly on finding out that the court had exercised its power to enter judgment or make an order against the applicant;
had a good reason for not attending the hearing or directions appointment; and
has a reasonable prospect of success at the hearing or directions appointment.”
The use of this statutory power does not amount to the exercise of an originating inherent jurisdiction. It is not clear why the power was not considered in Re W (Holman J and CA), where the mother had not been given notice of the adoption hearing. A recent unreported case provides a good example of its use in this context. A circuit judge made an adoption order in the absence of the birth mother, who had attended every hearing so far. She contacted the court the next day, saying that she had wanted to attend the hearing but had not had notice. The judge made a further order that day, giving the mother the chance to apply to set aside the order within 7 days. She did so, and he relisted the matter a week later. After hearing submissions and some evidence, he accepted that the mother had not had notice. He set aside the adoption order and made a new adoption order. That was an appropriate exercise of that court’s powers and the mother’s application for permission to appeal from the adoption order on other grounds was refused by this court.
The court (High Court or Family Court) may also be able to employ FPR 2010 29.16, known as the slip rule:
“Correction of errors in judgments and orders
The court may at any time correct an accidental slip or omission in a judgment or order.
A party may apply for a correction without notice.”
This power, and its equivalent in CPR 40.12, is most often used to correct minor blemishes or omissions in orders. However, it can be deployed wherever there has genuinely been an accidental error or omission, but not as a way for the court to have second or additional thoughts: Santos-Albert v Ochi [2018] EWHC 1277 (Ch), [2018] WLR (D) 315, [2018] 4 WLR 88 at §27. It is strongly arguable that the circuit judge’s “obvious aberration” in making an adoption order in Re J (Hayden J) was an accidental error, as seen by her immediate attempt to set it aside the next day. That course was apparently open to her, but in view of the sensitivity once the prospective adopters had learned of the judgment, it was sensible for the matter to be resolved by the family presiding judge. However, it was not seemingly necessary to rely on any inherent jurisdiction to achieve that outcome.
As to the decision in Re O, for strict correctness, Sir James Munby P could have sat in the Court of Appeal and set aside the adoption order unopposed under CPR PD52A 6.4-6.5. That would have been possible because the setting aside of the order was a formality, albeit an important one, being no more than a corollary to the declaration of parentage, and with no competing third party or public interest. The important point is that the temptations of convenience must not become a slippery slope towards the assumption of a legal power.
It follows from the above that the statements about the extent and nature of the powers of the High Court, originating in Re W, continuing in Re O, and culminating in the summary in AX v BX at §80(5)-(7), are not correct and should not be followed. It further follows that the two cases in which adoption orders were set aside for welfare reasons (Re PK and AX v BX) were wrongly decided, albeit from the best of motives. As was made clear in Re B, the fact that an adoption has turned out badly and that revocation would serve the interests of the adopted person, whether a child or an adult, is not a reason for the court to supply a remedy that Parliament has chosen not to provide.
The court is of course required to act within a human rights framework and it is possible to imagine such an extreme situation arising that the revocation of an adoption order becomes necessary if the court is to comply with its Convention obligations. However, the remedy in such a case would almost certainly be an appeal out of time, and not an originating application. Further, it is highly unlikely that the Article 8 right to respect for family life or for personal identity could ever be of such weight as to justify an outcome that is at odds with the statutory scheme of adoption that has prevailed in this country for a century. Such an outcome would (per Re B at 340g) “undermine the whole basis on which adoption orders are made, namely that they are final and for life as regards the adopters, the natural parents and the child”.  Any change in that state of affairs is a matter for Parliament.
Conclusions
The conclusion that we have reached on consideration of the previously decided cases, which holds firmly that there is no jurisdiction at first instance to set aside a validly made adoption order, is on all fours with the summary of the underlying policy considerations put forward by the SoS, which we accept [paragraph 36 above]. Those policy considerations are, in turn, plainly in line with the approach of Swinton Thomas LJ, Simon Brown LJ and Sir Thomas Bingham MR in Re B. These are matters of fundamental principle with respect to adoption. Adoption orders are transformative, have a peculiar finality and are intended to be irreversible, lasting throughout life, as if the child had been born to the adopter. That high degree of permanence, from which the benefits to the child of long-term security and stability should flow, is the unique feature that marks adoption out from all other orders made for children; it is, at its core, what adoption is all about. We agree with the SoS that it would gravely damage the lifelong commitment of adopters to their adoptive children if there were a possibility of the finality of the adoption order being challenged on welfare grounds.
In reaching our decision, we have been acutely aware that it will be profoundly unwelcome to each of the lay parties in this appeal. We have particularly heard what Y has said so clearly to us through the well-placed submissions of Mr Bowe. In the circumstances of this case, where she and her sister have never fully left their birth family and committed to their adoptive home, despite the consistently child-centred efforts of AM, Y and, maybe to a lesser extent, X will be profoundly upset by this outcome. If the court did have a welfare based jurisdiction then the outcome, as Lieven J indicated, would probably have been different.
We are also very conscious that this is by no means an isolated case and that there will be other, possibly many other, adoptive relationships which have broken down and for whom the ability to resort to the court to revoke the adoption order would be earnestly welcomed. But, for the reasons we have given, both the law, as passed by Parliament and as previously interpreted by this court, and the policy underlying the statutory adoption regime have inevitably led us to hold as we have done.
For the reasons that we have given, the appeal must be dismissed. Rather than holding, as all parties submitted was the case, that Lieven J’s interpretation of the extent of any inherent jurisdiction to revoke an adoption order was too narrow, we have concluded that the reality is that no such jurisdiction exists.

JUDGE BRIDGET SANGER
Between
WAQAR MOHAMMED AYUB
Appellant
and
REGISTRAR FOR APPROVED DRIVING INSTRUCTORS
Respondent
Decision: The appeal is dismissed.
REASONS
Introduction
This is an appeal against a decision of the Registrar of Approved Driving Instructors (‘the Registrar’), made on 14 June 2024, to refuse to grant the Appellant a second trainee licence.
Legal Framework
The grant of a trainee licence enables applicants to provide instruction for payment before they are qualified.
A trainee licence may be granted in the circumstances set out in s. 129 of the Road Traffic Act 1988 (‘the Act’) and the Motor Cars (Driving Instruction) Regulations 2005.
A licence under section 129(1) of the Act is granted: ‘for the purpose of enabling a person to acquire practical experience in giving instruction in driving motor cars with a view to undergoing such part of the examination... as consists of a practical test of ability and fitness to instruct.’
In order to qualify as an Approved Driving Instructor, applicants must pass the Qualifying Examination. This comprises: the written examination (‘Part 1’); the driving ability and fitness test (‘Part 2’); and the instructional ability and fitness test (‘Part 3’).
Three attempts are permitted at each part. The whole examination must be completed within 2 years of passing Part 1, failing which the whole examination has to be retaken.
If a candidate has passed Part 2, they may be granted a trainee licence. The grant of a trainee licence enables applicants to provide instruction for payment before they are qualified. It is possible to qualify as an Approved Driving Instructor without having held a trainee licence.
The powers of the Tribunal in determining this appeal are set out in s.131 of the Act. The Tribunal may make such order as it thinks fit.
When making its Decision, the Tribunal stands in the shoes of the Registrar and takes a fresh decision on the evidence available to it, giving appropriate weight to the Registrar’s decision as the person tasked by Parliament with making such decisions.
The burden of proof in satisfying the Tribunal that the Registrar’s decision was wrong rests with the Appellant.
Factual Background to the Appeal
The Appellant had previously been on the Register between January 2019 and January 2022.
The Appellant passed Part 1 of the Qualifying Examination on 9 February 2023. He passed Part 2 on 10 July 2023.
The Appellant booked Part 3 test on 16 April 2024 but cancelled the appointment. He booked a further test on 11 June 2024, which was cancelled by DSA. He booked a third appointment, which he took on 17 June 2023. He failed the test on this, his first attempt.
The Appellant was in receipt of a trainee licence which was valid from 4 December 2023 to 3 June 2024.
The register records his 21AT/S being completed on 20 May 2024.
On 24 May 2024 the Appellant applied for a second trainee licence. This was before the expiry if his first trainee license.
On 29 May 2024 he was informed, by the Registrar, that he was considering refusing the application and invited to make representations.
In response, the Appellant stated that it had been difficult to obtain a part 3 test in the time frame.
The application was refused on 14 June 2024.
The reasons for the Registrar’s decision, in summary, was that
The Appellant had failed to comply with the conditions of his first license, in that the training objectives on the ADI 21AT training record form were not completed in the first three months of the license period. Nor had he provided any evidence of lost training time;
the Appellant had failed the instructional ability test and cancelled a further test booked for 16 April 2024;
the Appellant had already had a sufficient amount of time to gain experience to assist in passing Part 3 of the Qualifying Examination and that it was not the intention of Parliament that candidates should be issued with trainee licences for as long as it takes them to pass the examination, and that the trainee licence system must not be used as an alternative to registration as a fully qualified Approved Driving Instructor.
Appeal to the Tribunal
The grounds of appeal are, in summary:
The Appellant was unable to book a test once three months had elapsed; he felt it was unfair for DVSA to reject his application on that basis;
He had moved abroad and missed an email reminding him of the standards check but had restarted the process; to refuse a second trainee license was prejudicial to his progress;
He failed a test on 17 June 2024 and the reason he gives is that the first test (11th June) was cancelled at short notice and the pupil he was meant to take was no longer available owing to it being a religious holiday. In order to avoid being out of work, he had to “source” an unfamiliar pupil, a family friend.
The Registrar, in his response, states:
the purpose of the provisions governing the issue of licences is to afford applicants the opportunity of giving instruction to members of the public whilst endeavouring to achieve registration. The system of issuing licences is not and must not be allowed to become an alternative to the system of registration;
the licence granted to applicants is not to enable the instructor to teach for however long it takes to pass the examinations, but to allow up to six months experience of instruction. This provides a very reasonable period in which to reach the qualifying standard in the examination and in particular, to obtain any necessary practical experience in tuition. Moreover, by virtue of the Appellant having applied for a second licence before the expiry date of the first, that licence has remained in force to the present time and will allow him to continue to give paid instruction until determination of the appeal;
since passing his driving ability test the Appellant has failed the instructional ability test once and cancelled one more such test booked for 16 April 2024. Regrettably, DVSA cancelled one such test booked for 11 June 2024. Despite ample time and opportunity the Appellant has not been able to reach the required standard for qualification as an Approved Driving Instructor;
the refusal of a second licence does not bar the Appellant from attempting the instructional ability test of the Register examinations. He does not need to hold a licence for that purpose, nor is it essential for him to give professional tuition under licence in order to obtain further training. The Appellant could attend a training course, or study and practice with an Approved Driving Instructor or give tuition on his own (provided that he does not receive payment of any kind for this). These alternatives are used by some trainees who acquire registration without obtaining any licences at all;
it should be noted [as at 25 June 2024] that the Appellant has not yet booked his second attempt at the instructional ability test.
The Appellant submitted a response as follows:
all but 2 of the 40 hours of his training were completed within the timeframe. The 2 hours that were not completed within the timeframe were due to illness on the day of a scheduled webinar;
the Respondent has failed to take into account the waiting time for part 3 tests in considering that 6 months is an appropriate timeframe in which to reach the qualifying standard and the Appellant is not able to provide training without a license because his training provider requires him to be licensed and he does not own his own vehicle or have the resources to purchase one;
the original test on 16th April was cancelled after the death of a relative. The re-booked test was on 11th June with a familiar pupil  but was rearranged to a date the pupil could not attend, owing to it being Eid (a religious festival). So as not to lose the date the Appellant arranged for a family friend to attend, with whose driving he was not familiar;
the Appellant is looking for the earliest available date.
Evidence
I read and took account of a bundle of documents.
Discussion and Conclusions
I may overturn the decision of the Registrar if I am of the opinion that it was wrong. The burden is on the Appellant to show this.
I accept the Appellant’s evidence in respect of his non-compliance with the training timetable.
I accept the evidence of the Appellant with regard to the reasons for his test cancellations and I have sympathy with his position.
However, it seems to me that there were other options open to the Appellant, in that he could have further rearranged the date or sought another pupil with whom he was more familiar. I note that a driving instructor will not be familiar with the driving style of every pupil, particularly new ones, and note that it is the performance of the trainee instructor that is being assessed, not the performance of the pupil, in a part 3 test.
I note that the Appellant has already had the benefit of trainee licences covering a period of 6 months from 2023-December-4 initially and, by virtue of this application, up to today’s date. This is over a year, which should have been adequate time to prepare.
I also note that the Appellant, at the time the bundle was prepared, had not booked his second test. He may by now have done so.
The Appellant can continue to study and practice and is able to continue to gain experience and take the test without a trainee licence.
The trainee license is not a substitute for taking and passing the test. It is not the purpose of trainee licences to keep renewing them until all attempts at passing Part 3 have been taken.
Having weighed all matters in the balance, the Appellant has not persuaded me that the Registrar’s decision was wrong in any way. In all the circumstances, I agree with the Registrar’s decision and the appeal is dismissed.

APPROVED JUDGMENT
Deputy High Court Judge Karen Ridge:
Introduction
This is an application under s. 289 Town and Country Planning Act 1990 for permission to appeal the decision of the First Respondent’s appointed Inspector to dismiss the Appellant’s appeal against an enforcement notice issued by the Second Respondent.  That enforcement notice was issued on 27 October 2023 in relation to land adjacent to Romani Street, St Albans Road, South Mimms, Potters Bar, Hertfordshire EN6 3PP (the land).  The Inspector’s Decision Letter (DL) was dated 8 August 2024.
There is a long and complex planning history to the land the subject of the enforcement notice which is fully set out in the three skeleton arguments before me and other documents.  The DL sets out the history of the site going back to 1962, the various uses which have taken place on the land and what happened to those uses to date.  The land is a flat piece of land adjacent to a house named Romani and it contains a Nissen Hut which has been in situ since at least 1964.  The periods over which the Inspector examined the land uses run from the 1960s and, by common consensus, that period was subdivided into the “Welsh Period” from 1962 to 1979 and the “Beech Period” running from 1979 to 2018.
Events leading to the Enforcement Notice Appeal
The case is a little unusual in that a previous enforcement notice had been appealed and been subject to a Public Inquiry process. Within that process the first Inspector had arrived at a different view to that which had been agreed by both parties.  At the first inquiry the parties had agreed that the use which was being enforced against was the same as the original 1970s use.  The Inspector disagreed with that proposition, and concluded that, to continue to determine the appeal, would lead to prejudice to both parties.  In the circumstances the original enforcement notice was quashed and a revised notice issued.
The enforcement notice which is the subject of this appeal alleged a material change of use of the land to a construction contractor’s depot for various ancillary activities.  The Appellant appealed against the notice on grounds set out within section 174(2) (a), (c), (d), (f) and (g) of the 1990 Act, namely that planning permission should be granted; that there had been no breach of planning control; that at the date of issue, no enforcement action could be taken; that the steps required to comply with the notice were excessive and that the period for compliance was too short.
The appeal against the enforcement notice was by public inquiry at which the Inspector was provided with statutory declarations and evidence from the previous appeal, as well as new witness statements from Mr. Rudman and Mr. Welsh and other professional witnesses.  Other evidence included photographs from both parties, a series of google earth images from 1999 to 2022, aerial photographs from 2010 and 2015, photographs supplied by local residents and photographs from the local planning authority site visits.  Mr. Welsh and Mr. Wilson did not attend to give oral evidence.  Mr. Rudman did attend and his evidence was subject to cross-examination.
The Decision Letter
The DL was issued on 8 August 2024.  In his DL the Inspector made a series of findings based on his assessment of the evidence.  His conclusions were then predicated upon his application of the legal tests to that evidence and those findings.  The Inspector concluded that, during Mr. Welsh’s period of ownership, the primary use of the site was storage and distribution of landscaping materials (DL18).  The Inspector further concluded that the use changed between 1973-1975 by virtue of the intervening possession by Balfour Beattie and their use of the land as a contractor’s depot, which was sui generis (DL22).  Thereafter the use of the site reverted back to storage from 1979 with the arrival of Mr. Beech (DL42) who appeared to operate a builder’s yard for “some time” but that use had ceased by 1999.
At DL44-DL47 the Inspector considers the question of the abandonment of uses and after analysing the evidence he concludes that there was a period of non-use for 20 years (DL46).  As a result of those conclusions, the Inspector concluded that the site was in nil use at the time that Mr. Ward took over the site and that the use alleged in the enforcement notice had only been undertaken for a few years and did not attract immunity from enforcement action.
The legal framework
The law is set out in full in the three skeleton arguments and I do not repeat it here save only to highlight key legal principles at the heart of this challenge.  Firstly, this is an appeal against the decision of the Inspector and as such the test in CPR rule 52.6 applies, namely permission to appeal may be given only where—
the court considers that the appeal would have a real prospect of success; or
there is some other compelling reason for the appeal to be heard.
In enforcement notice appeals the burden lies on the Appellant to demonstrate that a breach of planning control has become lawful to the civil standard of proof.
The Appellant relies on the reported case of Gabbitas v SSE and Newham LBC 1985 JPL 630 to challenge this Inspector’s consideration of the evidence before him.  That case concerned a claim regarding the Inspector’s treatment of unchallenged evidence within an enforcement notice appeal.  In Gabbitas the Inspector disregarded the unchallenged evidence, or rejected it, without giving good reason for doing so.  The Court found that the Inspector had concluded that a pre-1973 use had no material impact on residential amenity because no complaints had been received and further that there was no independent evidence to corroborate the appellant’s account.  The Court held that the Inspector was entitled to reject the appellant’s evidence for a good reason and the decision would have been unchallenged in that event, but in the Gabbitas case the Court found that the Inspector had given no reasons for rejecting uncontradicted evidence.  That was the failing.
Procedural matters
Before setting out the grounds of challenge, I must deal with a short evidential point.  The Appellant has submitted a further statutory declaration from Mr. Wilson.  I am not going to take any account of the contents of the statutory declaration for two reasons: firstly, it contains new information which was not before the Inspector and secondly there has been no application to the Court to admit it.  It is not therefore in accordance with the overriding objective to admit such evidence into this claim.
Grounds
There are five grounds of challenge but there is some repetition within the grounds which can be distilled into the following complaints: a failure to properly consider the evidence; a failure to apply the correct test to the evidence; and a failure to set out reasons.
The Inspector’s consideration of the evidence
The Inspector’s consideration of the evidence was detailed and thorough.  He systematically went through each of the relevant periods, considered the evidence and gave clear reasons for either rejecting or taking account of that evidence and where there were concerns about the quality of the evidence, he gave reasons for his views of that evidence and the weight he was going to attach to that evidence.
The DL properly sets out where evidence had been untested and where the Inspector had evidence which pointed in different directions, he weighed the evidence and came to a view as to the evidence to be preferred.  The DL is to be distinguished therefore from the situation in Gabbitas where that Inspector discounted evidence without providing reasons for doing so.  By contrast this Inspector has undertaken a careful analytical exercise in relation to each piece of evidence, looked at it individually, and then looked at it in the context of contradictory evidence.
The Appellant alleges that his evidence before the Inspector was unchallenged but that is not the case.  Whilst some of the evidence was not subject to cross examination, there were contradictory pieces of evidence before the Inspector and the evidence was considered in its entirety.  Where the Appellant’s evidence was contradicted by other evidence, the Inspector compares and contrasts that differing evidence and gives a clear reason for preferring the evidence he did.
The Welsh Period 1962-1979 (DL 16-21)
The Appellant contends that the evidence of Mr. Welsh and Mr. Rudman was independent and it was uncontested by the Council, that the evidence was clear and should not have been rejected.
The Inspector considered the evidence of Mr. Welsh and Mr. Rudman which he sets out in DL16-18.  At DL19 he analyses what that evidence means in terms of the use and concludes that, apart from the contracting work, there was nothing to suggest that the site was more than storage and distribution.  He goes on to set out the previous Inspector’s conclusions on this period and sets out that the Bairstowe Eve letter points to a yard used for transporting materials.
At DL20 the Inspector explains that, after considering all of that evidence, he found that there needed to be convincing evidence that more was going on, at a sufficient intensity, to conclude that there was more than a B8 use. That is an entirely rational approach.  He has clearly considered the evidence of sub-contracting at DL20 but does not believe that that suggests a fully-fledged contractors’ depot.  That is an entirely logical assessment of the evidence before him.
These were all reasonable and cogent findings on the basis of the evidence before him as to the use during this period.  He went on to conclude that the B8 use had been established by virtue of its commencement in 1962.
The Beech Period
The Appellant suggests that the Inspector wrongly rejects what is described as the “independent” evidence of Mr. Wright, Mr. Welsh and Mr. Rudman in favour of ‘his own interpretation of the aerial photographs’ but that is a mischaracterisation of the exercise undertaken.  At DL24 the Inspector considers and records Mr. Rudman’s evidence - noting that Mr. Rudman believed that Mr. Welsh was a builder and that the site was used to store building materials and that Mr. Beech did not access the site from the road but from the residential property Romani.
The Inspector then considered Mr. Wilson’s evidence.  Mr. Wilson did not give oral evidence, and the Inspector considered his statutory declaration noting that Mr. Wilson did not provide evidence of his qualifications.  Whilst the Inspector may have wrongly recorded that Mr. Wilson had not provided a date when he visited the site, that does not detract from the Inspector’s other more major criticisms and concerns regarding his evidence.   Any error regarding the date was not a material one in that the Inspector had concluded that there was contradictory evidence in the form of the photographic evidence of the site.
The Inspector expressed his views about Mr. Wilson’s ability to comment on the use and abandonment, he also noted that Mr. Wilson made no mention of the site being overgrown and he pointed to other parts of Mr. Wilson’s evidence which were contradicted by other pieces of evidence before the Inquiry.  At DL29 the Inspector considers pieces of evidence from local neighbours, Ms. Curran and Ms. McCaffrey which presented a ‘rather different picture’.  Importantly Mrs. Papaphilippoui’s evidence pointed to the storage being in the garden of Romani and not on the site.
The various aerial and Streetview photographs were also analysed at DL31 when the Inspector undertakes a careful evaluation of the information that can be gleaned from these photographs from 1971 up to 2018.  The Google Streetview photographs are also considered at DL33 and they are noted to show the same thing, namely an overgrown road frontage.  For the reasons given in DL34 the Inspector explains why he finds the objective evidence of the photographs compelling.  Again this is a careful analytical and necessary exercise considering the evaluation of all of the evidence.  Such an exercise is necessary to weigh the evidence and come to rational conclusions as to the activities on the land.
With regard to the importance attached by the Inspector to the photographic evidence DL31 deals with the Streetview and aerial photographs.  These photographs are objective evidence submitted by the Council to contradict the Appellant’s evidence.  All of those photographs are given careful consideration, they are not elevated above the other evidence, but all evidence is considered in the round, and the Inspector goes through each of the photographs describing what is shown and how it compares with the evidence of witnesses.  There is nothing in the complaint that there is an over reliance on the photographs.  They are part and parcel of the evidential jigsaw, from which the Inspector draws reasonable conclusions.
The analysis of the evidence of Mr. Wilson was careful and was done having regard to all of the other available evidence, looking at all of that evidence in the round and coming to a view as to which evidence to prefer.  The Inspector referred to the evidence of Mr. Rudman at DL24.  He set that evidence in context.  He was not obliged to record every detail of the evidence but to analyse those parts of the evidence which went to key issues.
It was not irrational of the Inspector, having considered all of the evidence, to come to the view that both Mr. Rudman and Mr. Welsh might be mistaken as to the timings of what they saw or that they confused the site with the adjacent Romani residence which was associated with the site.
Neither was the Inspector obliged to alert the Appellant to his thinking as the evidence progressed.  Indeed the Inspector would have needed to have heard the whole of the evidence and submissions before coming to his final view.
There were clear inconsistencies in the evidence.  It was the Inspector’s job to evaluate those inconsistencies and to come to clear findings on any differences leading to his conclusions.
Abandonment
The Inspector correctly identified and applied the tests on abandonment.  DL44 summarises the cases on abandonment and the Inspector is clearly aware of those tests.  Part of the Appellant’s challenge to the conclusions on abandonment is predicated on the earlier criticisms of the Inspector’s findings in relation to the evidence. I have already concluded that those criticisms of the Inspector’s treatment and analysis of the evidence are not substantiated.
At DL45 to 47 the Inspector again summarises the evidence, makes reasonable findings and concludes that a reasonable person would consider that the use had been abandoned.  Those conclusions were open to the Inspector and are based on sound foundations following a careful application of the correct legal tests.  Whilst the Inspector made previous comments about a reduction in the intensity of the use, he concludes at DL40 that the builder’s use had clearly ceased by 1999.  At DL46 the Inspector finds that no other uses have intervened, and the period of non-use was 20 years.
The Inspector properly understood and applied the relevant legal tests after a careful analysis of the evidence.  He was properly entitled, indeed expected to form his own judgment on the evidence and he undertook a thorough evaluation of all of the evidence.  There can be no criticism of the manner in which the task was undertaken.  That the Appellant has taken issue with the outcome of the Inspector’s judgment and evaluations does not mean that his decision was irrational.  The reasons given are cogent and rational.
I am satisfied that the grounds of appeal in relation to abandonment disclose no realistic prospect of success.  Since the challenge in relation to s57(4) is parasitic on this ground, any challenge in relation to s57(4) also falls away.
For these reasons, none of the grounds are arguable or have a realistic prospect of success and I refuse permission to appeal on all grounds.
I would ask Counsel to draw up an agreed Order for my approval.

.............................
Master Clark:
Application
This is the defendants’ application dated 29 May 2024 for summary judgment against the defendants to their Part 20 claim: the third party, Crimson Phoenix Solicitors Limited (“CPS”) and the fourth party, Wilkes Partnership LLP (“Wilkes”), both of which conduct business as solicitors.
Parties
The first to fifth defendants are companies incorporated for the purpose of each buying one of 5 properties in Welling, Kent: 4 to 8 Fairweather Close (“the properties”). The sixth defendant, Mr Azher Shareef, is a director and sole shareholder of the first to fifth defendants. Although he is an applicant on the face of the application notice, he is not a claimant in the Part 20 claim; and the defendants’ counsel confirmed that he is not an applicant in this application. For the purposes of this judgment, I refer to the first to fifth defendants as “the defendants”.
CPS acted for the sellers (or purported sellers) of the properties. Wilkes acted for the defendants as buyers. The purchase price was £1,991,100 (“the completion sum”).
The claimant, Ultimate Bridging Finance Limited (“the lender”), loaned to the defendants a total of about £2 million, of which £1,791.069.02 was used to pay the completion sum. Mr Shareef provided the balance of  £200,030.98  by way of director’s loans.
Factual background and the Part 20 claims
There was limited documentation before the court as to the conveyancing aspects of the transaction. CPS’s counsel suggested that this was because his client had been subject to an SRA intervention. However, the correspondence indicates that CPS’s conveyancing file was recovered from the SRA in June 2023, so that is not a satisfactory explanation.
Initially, the solicitors acting for the sellers were Crimson Phoenix Solicitors, a distinct entity from CPS. On 23 November 2022, a Ms Ranjo Kulasegaram emailed Osman Gul (of Wilkes):
“Thank you for your email below. I am no longer acing for Dr Indu Mitra in connection with the above matter under Crimson Phoenix Solicitors. Kindly forward all future correspondence to Nicole Smith. Please see attached herewith the letter dated 22 November 2022 from Crimson Phoenix Solicitors LTD for your information.”
Dr Indu Mitra was the director of the corporate owners of the properties.
The letter referred to in Ms Kulasegaram’s email was not in evidence. However, an hour later, an email was sent to Mr Gul by Nicole Smith, described in the email footer as a caseworker, stating:
“Ms Kulasegaram is no longer a part of this firm, hence the reason the matter has been passed over to me.”
On 1 December 2022, Ms Smith sent to Mr Gul documents including completed versions of the Law Society’s Form TA13 “Completion Information and Undertakings” (“Form TA13”) in respect of each of the properties. These were headed:
“WARNING: Replies to Requisitions 3.2 and 5.2 are treated as a solicitor's undertaking.”
Section 3.2 provided:
“WARNING: A reply to requisition 3.2 is treated as an undertaking. Great care must be taken when answering this requisition.
If we wish to complete through the post, please confirm that:
You undertake to adopt the Law Society's Code for
Completion by Post; and  Confirmed
The mortgages and charges listed in reply to 5.1
are those specified for the purpose of paragraph 6
of the Code  Confirmed”
Section 5.2 provided:
“WARNING: A reply to requisition 5.2 is treated as an undertaking. Great care must be taken when answering this requisition.
Do you undertake to redeem or discharge the  Yes   No
mortgages and charges listed in reply to 5.1 on
completion and to send to us Form DS1, DS3,
the receipted charge(s) or confirmation that notice
of release or discharge in electronic form has
been given to the Land Registry as soon as you
receive them?
Each form was signed (though the signature is illegible), and under the signature was printed: “Seller’s solicitor Crimson Phoenix Solicitors Limited”.
The Law Society's Code for Completion by Post (“the Code”) provided, so far as relevant:
In this code:
all references to the “Seller” are references to the person or persons who will be at the point of completion entitled to convey the legal and/or equitable title to the property and
all references to the “Seller’s Solicitor” are to the solicitor purporting to act for the party named as the seller in respect of the contract or purported contract that the buyer has entered into in order to acquire the property.
In complying with the terms of this code:
…
Where the Seller’s Solicitor receives and/or holds the money received for completion, the Seller’s Solicitor receives and/holds that money on trust for the person or persons who provided it, to be either
paid away only in respect of a completion in which the Seller executes and delivers a valid conveyance or transfer; or
repaid to the person who remitted it, if completion does not take place.
The Seller’s Solicitor undertakes:
to have the Seller’s authority to receive the purchase money on completion; and
on completion, to have the authority of the proprietor of each mortgage, charge or other financial incumbrance which was specified under paragraph 7 but has not then been redeemed or discharged, to receive the sum intended to repay it;”
As the Notes to the Code explain:
Paragraph 4 (ii) of this code makes explicit the effect of the decisions in Twinsectra Limited v. Yardley [2002] UKHL 12, Lloyds TSB Bank plc v. Markandan & Uddin (a firm) [2012] EWCA Civ 65 and P&P Property Limited v. Owen White & Catlin LLP and Dreamvar (UK) Limited v. Mishcon de Reya (a firm) [2018] EWCA Civ 1082, that the Seller’s Solicitor holds any purchase money received on trust for the person or persons who provided it and is under a fiduciary duty not to deal with that money other than in accordance with the terms of this code.
In view of the decision in P&P Property Limited v. Owen White & Catlin LLP and Dreamvar (UK) Limited v. Mishcon de Reya (a firm) [2018] EWCA Civ 1082, paragraph 8(i) of this code constitutes an undertaking that the Seller’s Solicitor has authority from the true owner of the title to the property named in the contract to receive the purchase money, and that such person is at the point of completion entitled to convey such title as the contract states will be conferred. This case law is also reflected in the definition of “Seller” used throughout this code.”
On 1 December 2022, Mr Gul emailed Ms Smith asking for revised copies of the TA13 forms, in which the full dates of the charges referred to in the forms were stated. He repeated this request on 2 December 2022, and Ms Smith sent amended forms that day. The forms remained, however, dated 29 November 2022, and the signatures on them appear to be the same as in the original forms sent.  On 2 December 2022, Mr Gul emailed Ms Smith about 3 further errors in the forms: the date stated for the charge over 7 Fairweather Close, and the name of the chargee for the charges over 4 and 8 Fairweather Close. Corrected forms (again still dated 29 November 2022 and still containing what appear to be the same signatures) were sent to him that day.
Attached to the Part 20 particulars of claim are copies of letters dated 2 and 5 December 2022 from, respectively, CPS and Wilkes, addressed to both TLT (the lender’s solicitors) and the lender itself. Both letters are signed, and set out that the letter has been signed by a solicitor who has authority to give undertakings on behalf of the firm.
Contracts were exchanged on 6 December 2022. On dates which are unclear, the completion sum was transferred to Wilkes’ client account, and then transferred by Wilkes to CPS.  However, CPS did not provide (and has not ever provided) to Wilkes the documents necessary to enable the defendants to be registered as proprietors of the properties at the Land Registry (Stock Transfer Forms and TR1s), and to remove the existing charges on the title (DS1s). CPS admits it has paid away the completion sum (although its Defence does not say to whom).
On 5 April 2023, the Solicitors Regulation Authority intervened into CPS.
On 5 December 2023, the lender commenced its claim in debt against the defendants.  The defendants’ Part 20 claim was issued on 19 March 2024.  CPS and Wilkes have also made Part 20 claims for contribution against each other.
On 28 June 2024, I granted summary judgment to the lender against the defendants in the sum of £2,465,518.53.
Claim against CPS
The primary claim against CPS is for breach of trust by releasing the completion monies to persons unknown. The defendants do not rely upon the court’s supervisory jurisdiction to enforce a solicitors’ undertaking. They accept that CPS, as a limited company, was not and is not an officer of the Court, and, accordingly, not subject to the court’s inherent jurisdiction to enforce a solicitor’s undertaking: Harcus Sinclair v Your Lawyers Ltd [2021] UKSC 32, [2022] AC 1271.
The trust is alleged to arise from the undertakings provided by CPS in the Form TA13, including an undertaking to adopt (and therefore comply with) the Code.
The particulars of claim also allege that the defendants are entitled to a contribution and/or indemnity pursuant to section 1 of Civil Liability (Contribution) Act 1978 (“the Contribution Act”) for any sums deemed owing to the lender by the defendants in the main claim; and the prayer seeks such a contribution and/or indemnity.
The defendants’ pleading of its contribution claim is sparse:
[CPS] provided an undertaking to [the lender]’s solicitors, TLT dated 2 December confirming among other things, that they were holding original DS1s”
[CPS] is also in breach of its undertakings to TLT and [the lender]”
There is no particularisation of the breaches, no allegation that the lender has suffered loss or damage nor what that loss or damage is alleged to have been.
CPS’s Defence admits that:
it acted in the transaction from about 23 November 2023;
the completion monies were transferred to its client account; and
it paid away the completion monies, although, as noted, it does not say to whom.
In its counsel’s oral submissions, CPS accepted (rightly, in my judgment) that Form TA13 (if signed with authority) and the Code would give rise to a trust obligation in respect of the completion monies.
CPS’s primary defence is that the Forms TA13 were not completed or signed on its behalf.  It pleads that the signatures on the forms are illegible, and that it does not know the identity of the person who signed them.
CPS denies the claim under the Contribution Act.  At para 33 of its Defence it pleads that the apparent signatory of the letter dated 2 December 2022 to TLT, Ms Techmina Malik, did not sign or authorise the signing of the letter; and that her signature was forged.
In addition, it pleads, at para 45, that:
the defendants have not adequately explained the basis on which it is alleged that CPS is liable to the lender;
the lender’s claim against the defendants is a debt claim and is not in respect of “the same damage” as any claim which the lender might make against CPS.
No Reply has been filed to CPS’s Defence.
Claim against Wilkes
The primary claim against Wilkes is for breach of trust in parting with the completion sum in circumstances where completion did not take place.
In its Defence, Wilkes admits that it parted with the completion sum, but does not admit that there was a fraud. It accepts, however, that if there was a fraud, it acted in breach of trust by paying the completion sum to CPS.
Wilkes’ primary defence to the breach of trust claim is that is it is entitled to be relieved from any breach of trust under the court’s powers under section 61 of the Trustee Act 1925.  Wilkes alleges that:
it acted honestly;
it acted reasonably- in particular, that it was not its responsibility to verify the identity of CPS’s clients, nor to check that CPS had verified the identity of its clients;
it ought fairly to be excused for breach of trust, because it acted in accordance with reasonable conveyancing practice.
Again, there is no Reply to Wilkes’ Defence. The defendants do not therefore advance any positive case as to why Wilkes did not act reasonably, or as to the steps that should have been taken by Wilkes for it to have acted reasonably.
In addition, Wilkes have filed evidence in support of their defence under section 61. The court is entitled to take this into account in assessing whether it has a real prospect of success in its defence: Bhamani v Sattar [2021] EWCA Civ 243. This evidence (Footnote: 1) sets out that if its insurers made a payment on this claim, then Wilkes’ excess would be £700,000 representing 90% of its current cash reserves.
Following the hearing of this application, Wilkes has filed evidence in an application (seeking information from CPS) showing that:
CPS’s insurers (IGI) have declined cover in respect of the claim made against it by the defendants and the contribution claim made against it by Wilkes;
This decision was reached on the basis that all of the directors of CPS committed or condoned dishonesty or fraud that caused the claim now made by the Defendants and Wilkes;
Two of CPS’s directors are challenging this decision;
If CPS became insolvent, Wilkes would have the right (pursuant to the Third Parties (Rights Against Insurers) Act 2010) to challenge the declining of cover;
Wilkes believes that IGI intends to conduct a “swift” arbitration in order to resolve the matter before Wilkes has acquired the above right.
The substance of this evidence is that there is at the very least a risk that if Wilkes succeeds in its Part 20 claim against CPS, that success will be worthless.
As to the defendants’ claim against Wilkes under the Contribution Act, this is also sparsely pleaded:
… Wilkes provided an undertaking to TLT dated 6 December 2022, confirming among other things, that it would transfer within 2 working days of completion completed and dated transfer of [the properties] from the sellers to the defendants and security documents.”
… Wilkes is also in breach of its undertakings to TLT.”
Again, there is no particularisation of the breaches, no allegation that the lender has suffered loss or damage, nor what that loss or damage is alleged to have been.
In Wilkes’ Defence:
it does not admit that it is liable to the lender;
if it is liable, then it denies that it is liable for the “same damage” as the damage for which the defendants are liable to the lender.
Legal principles
Summary judgment
CPR 24.2 provides, so far as relevant:
“The court may give summary judgment against a … defendant on the whole of a claim or on a particular issue if –
it considers that the party has no real prospect of succeeding on the … defence or issue; and
there is no other compelling reason why the case or issue should be disposed of at a trial.”
The principles to be applied on applications for summary judgment are well established.  They were summarised by Lewison J, as he then was, in Easyair Ltd v Opal Telecom Limited [2009] EWHC 339 (Ch), and approved in several appellate authorities.  It is unnecessary to set them out here.  The burden of proof is on the applicant to show that the conditions in CPR 24.2 are satisfied.
Conveyancing solicitors’ trust obligations
Where, as here, a conveyancing transaction takes place in accordance with the Code, then the parties’ solicitors’ fiduciary obligations are set out in P&P Property Limited v. Owen White & Catlin LLP and Dreamvar (UK) Limited v. Mishcon de Reya (a firm) [2018] EWCA Civ 1082, [2019] Ch 273 (“Dreamvar”):
The ultimate question to be decided is whether at the point when the purchase money is released by the vendor’s solicitors to his client the solicitor has the authority of the purchaser to make that payment even if the transaction is not a genuine sale. If the vendor’s solicitor does not have the purchaser’s authority to make that payment then, subject to any question of relief under section 61, he acts in breach of trust. The purchase money belongs to the purchaser and is held on a bare trust for his benefit and subject to his instructions. Part of the argument on this issue has ventured into questions of whether the money was held by the vendor’s solicitors on some kind of Quistclose trust (see Quistclose Investments Ltd v Rolls Razor Ltd [1970] AC 567) but that can only arise as an issue if the money in the hands of the vendor’s solicitor would not otherwise be the subject of a trust in favour of the purchaser.
The agreed starting point must be that in the hands of its own solicitor the purchase moneys were held on a bare trust for the purchaser pending completion: see Target Holdings Ltd v Redferns [1996] AC 421, 436. The entitlement of the solicitor to part with the money is governed by the instructions he receives from his client. It is not suggested that those instructions permitted the purchaser’s own solicitors to release the moneys except on completion of a genuine sale and purchase of the property …”
Liability in respect of the same damage
Sections 1(1) and 6(1) of the Contribution Act provide, so far as relevant:
“1.— Entitlement to contribution.
… any person liable in respect of any damage suffered by another person may recover contribution from any other person liable in respect of the same damage (whether jointly with him or otherwise).”
…
—Interpretation
A person is liable in respect of any damage for the purposes of this Act if the person who suffered it (or anyone representing his estate or dependants) is entitled to recover compensation from him in respect of that damage (whatever the legal basis of his liability, whether tort, breach of contract, breach of trust or otherwise).”
In URS Corporation Limited v BDW Trading Limited [2023] EWCA Civ 772, [2024] KB 827, the Court of Appeal held that the right to make a claim for contribution is established when the three ingredients set out in s.1(1) of the Contribution Act can be properly asserted and pleaded, namely:
is Party B liable, or could they be found liable, to Party A?
is Party C liable, or could they be found liable, to Party A?
are the respective liabilities of Party B and Party C in respect of the same damage suffered by Party A?
The meaning of “same damage” was considered by the Court of Appeal in Howkins & Harrison v Tyler [2001] PNLR 27. In that case, valuers had accepted their liability to a lender in respect of their negligent valuation of a property which was the security for the loan. The borrower had defaulted on the loan, and the lender had sold the property for less than its loan, thereby sustaining a loss.  The valuers sought a contribution from the borrower under the Contribution Act, on the basis that the borrower was partially responsible for this loss.
The Vice Chancellor (with whom the other Judges agreed) began by considering the damage for which the valuers and the borrower were liable to the lender. The valuers were liable for the damage to the lender in lending money which, had it not been for the valuers’ negligence, it would not have lent.  The borrower was liable for their failure to pay the lender the sum due under their contract with it. He continued:
Is that the same damage as that for which the [valuers] were liable? In my view it is plainly not the same damage. The “damage” for which the respondents are liable is that the [lender] has not been paid the sum of money contractually due. The damage for which the [valuers] were liable was the damage to the [lender] in lending money that the [lender] would not otherwise have lent. The respective formulations of the “damage”, it seems to me, carry the case outside the scope of section 1(1) of the 1978 Act.”
He then formulated the following test where there are two parties who are each said to be liable to another party in respect of the “same damage” suffered by it (I follow the naming of the parties used above (and not that used in the judgment), for the sake of clarity).  The two questions to be asked are:
If B pays A a sum of money in satisfaction, or on account, of B's liability to A, will that sum operate to reduce or extinguish, depending upon the amount, C's liability to A?
If C pays A a sum of money in satisfaction or on account of C's liability to A, would that operate to reduce or extinguish B's liability to A?
Unless the answer to both of those questions is yes, the case is not one to which the 1978 Act applies.
The Vice Chancellor explained the policy of the Act at [18]:
“The Act was intended to deal with cases where the damage suffered by the victim could be remedied by a claim against one or other of two or more possible defendants, and where the quantification of the damage to the victim for which a defendant would be liable would be affected by what the victim might recover or had recovered from one or other of the possible defendants. If that condition is not present, it seems to me that the Act was not intended to apply and cannot be applied.”
Section 61 Trustee Act 1925
Section 61 of the Trustee Act 1925 provides:
“Power to relieve trustee from personal liability.
If it appears to the court that a trustee, whether appointed by the court or otherwise, is or may be personally liable for any breach of trust, whether the transaction alleged to be a breach of trust occurred before or after the commencement of this Act, but has acted honestly and reasonably, and ought fairly to be excused for the breach of trust and for omitting to obtain the directions of the court in the matter in which he committed such breach, then the court may relieve him either wholly or partly from personal liability for the same.”
There are therefore 3 elements to the defence provided by the section:
honesty;
reasonableness;
whether the court should exercise its discretion.
As to reasonableness, the requisite standard is reasonableness, not perfection: Nationwide Building Society v Davisons Solicitors [2012] EWCA Civ 1626; [2013] PNLR 12 at [48].
As to whether the court should exercise its discretion to excuse from liability, this involves balancing the impact on the defaulting trustee with the impact on the beneficiaries. Briggs LJ (as he was) explained this in Santander UK v RA Legal Solicitors [2014] EWCA Civ 183, [2014] Lloyd's Rep FC 282, [2014] PNLR 20 (cited in Dreamvar at [107]):
The second main stage of the section 61 analysis, usually described as discretionary, consists of deciding whether the trustee ought fairly to be excused for the breach of trust. This requires that regard be had to the effect of the grant of relief not only upon the trustee, but also upon the beneficiaries: see Marsden v Regan [1954] 1 WLR 423, per Evershed MR at 434; and Bartlett v Barclays Trust Co. (No.1) [1980] Ch 515, per Brightman J. at 538A. Furthermore, section 61 makes it clear that even if the trustee ought fairly to be excused, the court still retains the discretionary power to grant relief from liability, in whole or in part, or to refuse it. In the context of relief sought by solicitor trustees from liability for breach of trust in connection with mortgage fraud, much may depend at this discretionary stage upon the consequences for the beneficiary. An institutional lender may well be insured (or effectively self-insured) for the consequences of third party fraud. But an innocent purchaser may have contributed his life's savings to the purchase and have no recourse at all other than against his insured solicitor, where for example the fraudster is a pure interloper, rather than a dishonest solicitor in respect of whose fraud the losers may have recourse against the Solicitors' Compensation Fund.”
Discussion and conclusions
Claim against CPS
As noted above, CPS’s defence is that the Forms TA13 were not signed or provided with its authority.  The defendants’ counsel accepted that whether there was actual authority was a triable issue i.e. one as to which CPS have a real prospect of success.
The difficulty faced by the defendants is that their only pleaded case is based on actual authority.  They have not pleaded a case based on Ms Smith having apparent or ostensible authority to provide the undertakings, nor that she was held out by CPS as its representative.  In those circumstances, the defendants cannot in my judgment, show that CPS has no real prospect of successfully defending the claim.
Claim against Wilkes
Breach of trust
Wilkes’ counsel rightly accepted it was subject to the trust obligations identified in §87 of Dreamvar. Thus, it would be liable for breach of trust by releasing the completion sum, unless this was done on completion of a genuine sale and purchase of the property.  Wilkes’ defence as to this is based on its non-admission that the transaction was not genuine.  It does not put forward any positive case that it was genuine.  I am satisfied that Wilkes has no real prospect of success on that issue.  There is no real prospect of there being any other explanation as to why the transaction was not completed.
Section 61 defence
As to Wilkes’ defence relying on section 61, again, as noted, the defendants have not pleaded in a Reply to this defence, nor is a basis for rejecting the section 61 defence put forward in their evidence (or their application notice).  Their pleaded case and filed evidence do not therefore in my judgment show that the defence has no real prospect of success.
The only grounds for rejecting the defence are contained in the defendants’ skeleton argument.  This is not in my judgment sufficient where summary judgment is sought. The (Part 20) claimant must plead its case and show by its evidence that there is no real defence to it. In case, however, that I am wrong about this, I consider the arguments put forward the defendants in their skeleton argument.
Honesty
The defendants do not suggest that Wilkes did not act honestly.
Reasonableness
Reasonableness is a fact sensitive, multi-factorial issue, which is generally (though not always) unsuitable for summary judgment.
In his skeleton argument, the defendants’ counsel puts forward two factors as showing a failure to act reasonably, sufficient to justify refusing relief under section 61:
Wilkes were professionals whose services were paid for by the defendants;
Wilkes failed to make careful enquiries to ensure that the alleged sellers were in fact the true owners of the properties.
As to the first, this cannot in my judgment be determinative as to whether a trustee has acted reasonably.  I accept of course that a stricter approach is taken to professional trustees than gratuitous ones: see Dreamvar at [107].  However, the mere fact that Wilkes are professionals is not enough of itself to prevent them from relying on section 61.
As to whether Wilkes should have made enquiries of CPS, its evidence is contained in the witness statement of Andrew Watts, a partner in the firm. He sets out that he verified the identity of its own client, which for these purposes was Mr Shareef, as the director and shareholder of the defendants.
Rule 8.1 of the SRA Code of Conduct for Solicitors provides for a solicitor to verify the identity of their own client :
“When you are providing services to the public or a section of the public
8.1: Client identification
You identify who you are acting for in relation to any matter”
In addition, solicitors are required to comply with various anti-money laundering procedures, such as those contained in the Money Laundering Regulations 2017.  These also require the identity of the client to be verified.
Mr Watts’ evidence is that he did not verify the identity of CPS’s client, because he believed that it was CPS’s obligation to do, both under the SRA Code and to comply with anti-money laundering legislation.  Similarly, he did not ask CPS to confirm that it had fulfilled those obligations – it did not occur to him that it had not done so.
Finally, Mr Watts’ evidence is that he cannot recall ever asking for such confirmation from the other side of a conveyancing transaction.
His position is supported by the fact that references to the “Seller” in the Code are to the actual or real owner.  The effect of para 4(ii) of the Code is that the Seller’s solicitors receive the completion monies to hold them on trust for completion with the real owner of the property. There is therefore in my judgment a real prospect of the court concluding that Wilkes acted reasonably by paying the completion monies to CPS on the footing that either:
completion would take place with the real owner of the properties; or
the monies would be returned to Wilkes.
The defendants have not filed any evidence as to these matters, nor have they submitted that there are any provisions in the SRA’s codes or in anti-money laundering legislation requiring the enquiries which they say Wilkes acted unreasonably in not making. In my judgment, Wilkes have a real prospect of showing that they acted reasonably in not making any further enquiries.
Thus, I am not satisfied that Wilkes have no real prospect of success in showing that they acted reasonably.
Whether Wilkes ought reasonably to be excused from liability
As to this, Wilkes relies upon the financial difficulties arising from its insurance position (see para 34 above) and the fact that there is a real risk that it will be without recourse to CPS (see paras 35 and 36 above).
There is no evidence of the impact on the defendants if relief is granted. Their counsel submitted that in circumstances where the purchases have fallen through, the immediate financial impact on the defendants is obvious.  However, the defendants are limited companies, and are only liable to the extent of their assets.  The person who arguably will suffer hardship is Mr Shareef, as guarantor of the defendants’ liabilities to the lender, but he is not a claimant in the defendants’ Part 20 claim. I cannot therefore conclude that Wilkes has no real prospect of showing that it ought reasonably to be excused.
Contribution claim
I turn now to consider whether the defendants have a claim against CPS and Wilkes under the Contribution Act.  Applying the test set out in URS Corporation, the questions to be asked are:
are the defendants liable, or could they be found liable, to the lender?
is CPS/Wilkes liable, or could they be found liable, to the lender?
are the respective liabilities of CPS/Wilkes in respect of the same damage suffered by the lender?
Applying this test, first, the defendants have of course been found liable to the lender.
Undertakings to the lender/TLT
CPS’s liability to the lender depends on it having given the undertakings in the letter dated 2 December 2022, apparently signed on its behalf.  As noted, CPS alleges that the signature was a forgery, so that it did not give the undertakings.  For the reasons discussed above, this plainly gives rise to a triable issue and prevents the defendants from showing that CPS has no real prospect of defending this part of their claim.
Wilkes admits it provided the undertakings alleged.
Breach of undertakings
Again, as noted, this part of the claim is completely unparticularised, both as to the breaches alleged and the loss or damage alleged to have been caused by them.
On this basis alone, the defendants cannot satisfy the court that CPS/Wilkes have no real prospect of defending this part of the claim.  Nonetheless, I consider the position if they are liable for breaches of the undertakings identified in the Part 20 claim.
Liability in respect of the same damage
The question arising is whether the defendants and CPS/Wilkes are liable in respect of the same damage as the damage for which the defendants are liable.  Applying Howkins & Harrison, the defendants’ liability to the lender is the contractual liability to repay their debt.
The defendants argued that the lender’s claim against CPS/Wilkes is for breach of trust and breach of CPS’s undertaking to return all monies due if requested to do so unless completion had occurred.  This is not, however, how their case is pleaded in paragraph 35 of their Part 20 particulars of claim, which is that:
CPS undertook that they were holding original DS1s;
Wilkes undertook that it would “transfer” completed and dated Transfers and “security documents”.
(set out in full in paras 23 and 37 above)
Paragraphs 40 and 42 of the Pt 20 particulars of claim allege that CPS is in breach of its undertakings to TLT and the lender, and that Wilkes is in breach of its undertakings to TLT (though not to the lender).  The only way to construe these allegations is as referring to the undertakings pleaded in paragraph 35 of the Part 20 particulars of claim.
Thus, the defendants do not even allege that Wilkes was in breach of its undertakings to the lender.  They also, as noted, do not plead any case as to the damage resulting from the breaches. However, whatever damage the lender suffered by the breach of these undertakings, it is not the “same damage” as the defendants’ contractual liability to the lender in debt.  The defendants cannot, in my judgment, establish that CPS/Wilkes have no real prospect of showing that any damage for which they are liable to the lender is not the same damage as that for which the defendants are liable to the lender.
In addition, even if a claim that Wilkes is liable to the lender for breach of trust were fully pleaded and particularised, the matters which Wilkes raises in support of its section 61 defence to the defendants’ claim, could also be raised in defence to its liability to the lender, particularly where, as here, the lender is an institutional lender which may be insured (or effectively self-insured) – see [33] in Santander UK (cited at para 52 above).
Conclusion
For the reasons set out above therefore, and notwithstanding that the defendants are the innocent parties in these regrettable circumstances, I dismiss their applications for summary judgment.
Postscript
Following the circulation of this judgment in draft, the Court was informed (on 8 January 2025) that, pursuant to s.1000 of the Companies Act 2006, CPS was struck off the Companies Register on 25 December 2024, and dissolved on 31 December 2024.  The effect of the dissolution is that CPS has ceased to exist, and its assets have vested in the Crown bona vacantia. The current position therefore (and subject to any application to restore CPS to the register) is that no judgment can be entered against it by the defendants or Wilkes.

JUDGMENT
Mr Justice Constable:
Introduction
Mr Meagher, the Appellant and Claimant, is a student at the University of Cambridge, the First Respondent and Defendant (‘the University’), undertaking a PhD in law.  Mr Meagher did not successfully pass his final viva voce examination of his doctoral thesis.  He issued a claim against the University, together with five named individuals employed by the University, also Respondents to this appeal.   No issue remains in respect of the former Seventh Defendant.  This appeal relates to the participation of the Second to Sixth Defendants (‘the Individuals’)  and to the strike out of claims in contract, under the Consumer Rights Act, and in tort.  The claim alleges disability discrimination and victimisation of various kinds under the Equality Act 2010 (‘the Act’), breach of contract and breach of common law duty of care.  As a result, Mr Meagher claims substantial damages based on loss of anticipated earnings, together with general damages. Mr Meagher also seeks a declaration that the Defendants have discriminated against him, and requires by injunctive relief that the Defendants implement various adjustments.  Mr Meagher obtained an injunction against the University in July 2024 stating that “No steps shall be taken in relation to the Claimant’s PhD course or examination without the consent of the parties until the conclusion of these proceedings or further order.”
The original Particulars of Claim filed were the subject of a strike-out application made by the Respondents on the grounds of incoherence. That application was listed for hearing before HHJ Duddridge (‘the Judge’) on 19-20 March 2024. Following receipt of the Respondents’ skeleton, Mr Meagher filed an Amended Particulars of Claim (‘APoC’), settled by counsel. The Respondents did not object to this re-formulated claim save in three respects, two of which are the subject matter of the appeal. The first is the continued inclusion of a claim against the Individuals, and the second is one particular of breach in the contract and tort claims.
The Judge found that he would have struck out the original Particulars of Claim.  By way of case management decision, he struck out the claim against the Individuals as an abuse of process, in that they were ‘not worth the candle’ in the language of Jameel v Dow Jones Co Inc [2005] EWCA Civ 75, [2005] QB 946. He refused to permit the inclusion of one particular of the breach of contract claim and the duty of care claim. Mr Meagher appeals the Judge’s decisions.
The Amended Particulars of Claim (‘APoC’)
It is necessary to understand in a little detail the claims that have been brought and, importantly, the respective roles of the University and the Individuals.
The APoC identifies the Individuals as follows (1) Professor Findlay Stark, Chair of the Degree Committee of the University’s Faculty of Law (‘the Faculty’); (2) Professor Mark Elliott, the Chair of the Board of the Faculty; (3) and (4) Professor Mathias Landgraf and Professor Deborah Longbottom, Co-Chairs of the University’s Postgraduate Committee; (5) Ms Sarah D’Ambrumenil, Head of the University’s Office of Student Conduct, Complaints and Appeals (‘OSCCA’).
As pleaded at paragraph 13(1) of the APoC, pursuant to section 109(1) of the Equality Act, anything done by any of the Individuals in the course of their employment is to be treated as done by the University, insofar as such conduct amounts to a breach of the Equality Act. As pleaded at erstwhile paragraph 13(2) of the APoC, pursuant to section 110(1), the Individuals may be personally liable for any action of theirs which, pursuant to section 109(1) of the Act, was to be treated as done by the University and which amounted to a breach of the Act by the University.
Under the heading ‘Victimisation’, the APoC, at paragraphs 16-20, briefly recounts the fact of previous proceedings under the Act, relating to the conduct of two other employees, Professor Worthington and Professor Armstrong. A settlement was reached in January 2019 pursuant to which Mr Meagher would restart his PhD.  Paragraph 21 then asserts that he was subjected to a number of detriments in respect of his studies, such as the provision of a single supervisor who did not hold a position with the Faculty, and no advisor.  It is said that Mr Meagher was subject to these detriments because of the previous action. The allegations relate to the University only, and the Individuals are not named.
Under the next heading, ‘Thesis and Viva PCPs’, paragraph 23 records that the assessment of whether to award students within the Faculty a PhD is made, in accordance with the University’s regulations, based on a combination of a singular written thesis of around 100,000 words and an oral viva voce examination in which the candidate is asked questions about his thesis by two examiners appointed to assess his suitability for the award of a PhD. The requirements around the thesis and the viva are each said to be a process which is a provision, criteria or practice (a ‘PCP’) for the purposes of the Act.
Paragraph 25 then sets out the substantial disadvantages the Thesis PCP and the Viva PCP are said to have placed Mr Meagher at. The first, by way of example, is that Mr Meagher “is less able than other candidates of the same ability to produce a singular lengthy and multifaceted piece of work such as a PhD thesis”.
At paragraph 26, the APoC then identifies the duty it is said fell upon the University to take such steps as were reasonable to avoid these disadvantages, and paragraph 27 set out those steps; the first of these, by way of illustration, is that the University should have permitted Mr Meagher to have his suitability for award of a PhD to be assessed other than by way of a thesis.
Paragraphs 28 to 33 set out an equivalent set of disadvantages as required adjustments in respect of the viva PCP. Paragraph 34 states that on or around 10 September 2018 the University’s Disability Resource Centre (‘ADRC’) produced a Student Support Document (‘the SSD’) in respect of Mr Meagher. The SSD made recommendations for the conduct of the viva, including two of the adjustments forming part of the previously pleaded case namely that (1) any oral questions should have been (i) clearly signposted by reference to specific parts of the Mr Meagher’s thesis, rather than asked in general terms, and (ii) asked in the active, rather than the passive, voice; and (2) Mr Meagher should have been allowed pauses and breaks after oral questions had been asked, in order to allow him to mentally retrieve the words or information that he needed in order to answer the questions.
Under the heading, ‘the Claimant’s Viva’, the APoC first makes a complaint about the University’s failure to have provided a proofreader to Mr Meagher.  The pleading then states that the viva was to be conducted by a Professor Watt and Mee (as agents of the University), and chaired by Professor Gelsthorpe.
At paragraph 41, the APoC asserts that whilst Professor Gelsthorpe had been provided with the list of adjustments earlier identified in the pleading, Professors Gelsthorpe, Mee, or Watt had not been provided with the SSD itself and so their attention had not been drawn to the disabilities and need for adjustments, in breach of section 20 of the Act. At paragraphs 42 to 45, the APoC identifies those aspects in respect of which Mr Meagher says that the reasonable adjustments were not adhered to and that the viva was generally unsatisfactory.
Paragraphs 46 to 48 the APoC alleges that the significant damage to Mr Meagher’s ill-health caused by the conduct of the viva and sets out particulars of the University’s knowledge of these issues.
On 26 April 2023, the outcome of Mr Meagher’s viva was delivered. They declined to recommend the award of PhD but indicated that Mr Meagher should be allowed to revise his thesis and resubmit it. It is from this point on within the APoC that the Individuals feature for the first time. Mr Meagher made complaints to the Degree Committee, under the Chairmanship of Professor Stark (the former Second Defendant). The APoC alleges, at paragraph 54, that the Degree Committee met and recommended to the PostGraduate Committee that (1) Mr Meagher should not be awarded a PhD; and, (2) two additional examiners should be appointed to assess whether Mr Meagher should be awarded a PhD. This would ordinarily entail a reassessment of the Claimant’s thesis and a further viva examination; and (3) Mr Meagher should be permitted to amend his thesis prior to its consideration by new examiners.
Paragraph 55 contains the only substantive allegation against the former Third Defendant. It is said that Mr Meagher emailed Professor Elliot (Chair of the Board of the Faculty) alleging the discrimination and victimisation that he had been subjected to and requesting the reasonable adjustments, and Professor Elliot refused to engage and did not take steps towards implementing the adjustments requested.
Paragraph 57 states that the PostGraduate Committee met under the joint chairmanship of the former Fourth and Fifth Defendants (Professors Landgraf and Longbottom); this committee approved the recommendations of the Degree Committee referred to above, save that it did not adopt the recommendation to permit Mr Meagher to amend his thesis.
Paragraph 59 then alleges that notwithstanding the various repeated requests by Mr Meagher, the University repeatedly failed to make the requested adjustments and remains in breach of duty. At that stage Mr Meagher obtained the injunction.
The only specific or personal allegations made against any of the Individuals is that they were, without particularisation, ‘the primary alternatively a decision maker’ of the said committees.  The Individuals are, in effect, taken to be, or represent, the personal embodiment of the decisions made by committees forming part of the University management responsible for the determination of whether or what reasonable adjustments should have been made.
At paragraphs 66 and 66A, the APoC sets out the ‘Summary of Equality Act Claims’, and sets out 9 particulars of victimisation and discrimination against the University. Paragraph 67 claims that the former Second to Fifth Defendants are jointly and severally liable in respect of two such sub-paragraphs of paragraph 66, essentially alleging the failure to make reasonable adjustments in respect of the thesis and the viva.
Paragraphs 69 and 70 are allegations of breach of contract and duty of care against the University.
As regards remedies, paragraph 71 sought a declaration as regards the fact that the University and the Individuals discriminated against Mr Meagher.   Paragraph 72 sought an injunction. This paragraph was pleaded somewhat ambiguously as to whether, or indeed how, injunctions were sought against the Individuals. On its face it seemed to include the Individuals, but the cross-referenced paragraphs seemed limited to complaints against the University.   Paragraph 73 sought damages, on the basis that the non-completion of his PhD led to the lost opportunity to take up a tenancy as a barrister at a particular set of chambers and that Mr Meagher has, as such, suffered a substantial loss of earnings, as well as claiming general damages.
Appeals against a Case Management Decision to Strike Out
The decision to strike out the claims against the Individuals was a case management decision made pursuant to CPR rule 3.4(b).
As set out in Royal & Sun Alliance Insurance Plc v T&N Ltd [2002] EWCA Civ 1964 (QB), the Court is afforded a wide discretion in the context of case management decisions and, accordingly, a party seeking to overturn such a decision must overcome a high threshold.  The ambit of discretion entrusted to the Judge is generous.
An appellate court will only interfere with a discretionary evaluation where an appellant can identify one or more of the follows errors (Azam v University Hospital Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust [2020] EWHC 3384 per Saini J):
a misdirection in law;
some procedural unfairness or irregularity;
that the Judge took into account irrelevant matters;
that the Judge failed to take account of relevant matters; or
that the Judge made a decision which was ""plainly wrong"".
As Saini J then observed, the appellate court's role is to police a very wide perimeter and it will be rare that a judge who has exercised a discretion having regard to relevant considerations will have come to a conclusion outside that perimeter. He also emphasised that the weight to be given to specific factors is a matter for the trial judge and absent some wholly unjustifiable attribution of weight, an appellate court must defer to the trial judge.
A recent, helpful summary in respect of the powers of the Court to strike out claims as an abuse of process was given by Warby J (as he was then) in Duchess of Sussex v Associated Newspapers [2020] EWHC 1058 (Ch) at paragraphs 33-34:
“…(3) Rule 3.4(2)(b) is broad in scope, and evidence is in principle admissible. The wording of the rule makes clear that the governing principle is that a statement of case must not be ""likely to obstruct the just disposal of the proceedings"". Like all parts of the rules, that phrase must be interpreted and applied in the light of the overriding objective of dealing with a case ""justly and at proportionate cost"". The previous rules, the Rules of the Supreme Court, allowed the court to strike out all or part of a statement of case if it was ""scandalous"", a term which covered allegations of dishonesty or other wrongdoing that were irrelevant to the claim. The language is outmoded, but I agree with Mr White that the power to exclude such material remains. Allegations of that kind can easily be regarded as ""likely to obstruct the just disposal"" of proceedings.
""Abuse of process"" is a sub-set of category (b). An abuse of process is a significant or substantial misuse of the process. It may take a variety of forms. Typical examples are proceedings which are vexatious, or attempts to re-litigate issues decided before, or claims which are ""not worth the candle"" (Jameel v Dow Jones & Co Inc [2005] EWCA Civ 75 [2005] QB 946). But the categories are not closed.
…
In the context of r 3.4(2)(b), and more generally, it is necessary to bear in mind the Court's duty actively to manage cases to achieve the overriding objective of deciding them justly and at proportionate cost; as the Court of Appeal recognised over 30 years ago, ""public policy and the interest of the parties require that the trial should be kept strictly to the issues necessary for the fair determination of the dispute between the parties"": Polly Peck v Trelford [1986] QB 1000, 1021 (O'Connor LJ). An aspect of the public policy referred to here is reflected in CPR 1.1(2)(e): the overriding objective includes allotting a case ""an appropriate share of the court's resources, while taking into account the need to allot resources to other cases"".”
In The Duchess of Sussex, the Court struck out various allegations so as to confine the case to what is reasonably necessary and proportionate for the purpose of doing justice between the parties, and that the allegations struck out did not go to the ‘heart’ of the case.
At paragraph 33(4), of Warby J’s judgment, reference is made to ‘claims which are not worth the candle’ and the case of Jameel.  It is this principle that lies at the heart of the appeal in respect of the strike out of the claims against the Individuals.
Before turning to Jameel itself, the principle that a Court may strike out as abusive claims which are in principle legally coherent but in respect of which there exists such disproportionality between the benefit to the claimant and the cost to the defendant that continuation amounts to an injustice was established, at least in the context of group litigation, in A.B. & Ors v John Wyeth & Brother Ltd [1994] PIQR 109.The case involved a group action of around 5,000, mainly legally aided, litigants, claiming damages against the manufacturers and distributors of benzodiazepine anxiolytic or tranquilliser drugs, prescribed for them. In a very small proportion of the cases (3·4%), the prescribers, general practitioners and consultant psychiatrists employed by health authorities, had been joined in the proceedings as alternative defendants to the manufacturers: the claimants would only pursue such claims if the claims against the manufacturers failed. In those circumstances, any damages which might be recovered from the prescribers would be consumed entirely by the legal aid charges for the costs of the unsuccessful claims against the manufacturers. The prescribers successfully applied to strike out the claims on the ground the prescribers' irrecoverable costs were out of all proportion to any benefits which the plaintiffs might obtain from the litigation.  The Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal. In doing so, the Court of Appeal rejected the submission that the court as a matter of law could not strike out a viable cause of action on the basis that the benefit to the claimant was so small compared to the irrecoverable costs of the defendants, as to do so would interfere with the constitutional right of access to the courts and contrary to authority. However, the Court of Appeal emphasised the limited circumstances in which cases would be seen as abusive in this way.  Stuart-Smith LJ observed:
“In most cases, it will be quite inappropriate for the Court to enter upon the sort of cost benefit analysis which the judge undertook here. The Court cannot weigh the plaintiff's prospect of receiving £1,000 against the defendants' costs of £10,000 which may be irrecoverable; that can only be done at the trial. Alternatively, it is a matter for the commercial judgment of the defendant whether he attempts to reach a settlement with the plaintiff: and in so doing, he had to take into account as part of the equation that the plaintiff is legally aided or impecunious. But this case is quite different. One can see at a glance that the prescriber defendants will be put to astronomical expense in defending these contingent claims. And to what end? If the plaintiffs stood to obtain a substantial benefit, the position might well be different. But here the benefit is at best extremely modest, and in all probability nothing.”
Jameel itself was a libel case. In the relevant aspect of the judgment, the Court of Appeal considered that, if the claimant succeeded in his action, the damages would be very modest indeed. It could be said that the claimant will have achieved vindication for the damage done to his reputation, but both the damage and the vindication would be small. The cost of the exercise will have been out of all proportion to what has been achieved, the court concluding that resolution of the issues would involve ‘a lengthy and expensive trial’.  At 54, the Court observed that an abuse of process is of concern not merely to the parties but to the court.  It is no longer the role of the court simply to provide a level playing field, and to referee whatever game the parties choose to play on it. The Court is concerned to ensure that judicial and court resources are appropriately and proportionately used in accordance with the requirements of justice. Lord Philips then referred to the case of Schellenberg v BBC [2002] EMLR 296, in which the High Court struck out a defamation action on grounds of proportionality. Eady J considered that the Court must have regard to the possible benefits that might accrue to the claimant as rendering what he considered to be ‘such a significant expenditure’ potentially worthwhile.  Given the overriding objective’s requirement for proportionality, this meant that the judge was bound to ask whether ‘the game is worth the candle’.
Echoing these words, now adopted as shorthand for the Jameel principle, at [69], Lord Phillips concluded that ‘The game will not merely not have been worth the candle, it will not have been worth the wick’.  He continued at [70]:
“It would be an abuse of process to continue to commit the resources of the English court, including substantial judge and possibly jury time, to an action where so little is now seen to be at stake.  Normally where a small claim is brought, it will be dealt with by a proportionate small claims procedure.  Such a course is not available in an action for defamation where, although the claim is small, the issues are complex and subject to special procedure under the CPR.”
Jameel was considered in Sullivan (AKA Soloman) v Bristol Film Studios Ltd [2012] EWCA Civ 570, relating to an infringement of copyright claim.  The claim was struck out on the basis that the costs of fighting it were out of all proportion to the amount the claimant was likely to recover by way of damages, which was assessed by the judge as £50.  Obiter, Lewison LJ identified that, to some extent, defamation cases were a special case given that the County Court has no jurisdiction overactions for libel and slander.  The judge continued:
“What is important however is that Lord Phillips recognised that a small claim should normally be dealt with by a proportionate procedure. The mere fact that a claim is small should not automatically result in the court refusing to hear it at all. If I am entitled to recover a debt of £50 I should, in principle, have access to justice to enable me to recover it if my debtor does not pay. It would be an affront to justice if my claim were simply struck out. The real question, to my mind, is whether in any particular case there is a proportionate procedure by which the merits of a claim can be investigated. In my judgment it is only if there is no proportionate procedure by which a claim can be adjudicated that it would be right to strike it out as an abuse of process.”
Etherton LJ, in his concurring judgment, sought to emphasise that the disproportion justifying the strike out is not merely between the likely amount of damages the claimant would recover if successful in the proceedings and the litigation costs of the parties, it includes consideration of the extent to which judicial and court resources would be taken up by the proceedings. The judge in that case had been entitled to conclude that strike out was appropriate where the proceedings would involve a large amount of court time and would cost a great deal of money to argue and would be a disproportionate use of the court’s resources and unfair to the defendant.
Ms Steinhardt makes the point that in considering the question of proportionality in the context of a strike out, the Court must bear in mind the other powers that the Court has for dealing with issues of disproportionality, and, in particular, the refusal to allow the recovery of costs which may be disproportionate. For the Court to embark on exercising its powers of striking out in the context of disproportionality, there must be extreme or excessive disproportionality, over and above that which is already subject to cost management powers. It is not necessary to decide whether ‘extreme’ disproportionality will be a necessary touchstone in every case. However, it is clearly right that the extent of disproportionality, bearing in mind other management techniques available to the Court, will obviously be an important factor which must be weighed carefully before coming to the conclusion, no doubt with caution, that the continuation of some part of or all the proceedings is an abuse of process.
Sections 109 and 110 of the Act
In considering the grounds of appeal, it is helpful to have clearly in mind the regime provided for within the Act which forms the basis of the relevant claims against the University and the Individuals.
Sections 109 and 110 of the Act provide as follows:
Liability of employers and principals
Anything done by a person (A) in the course of A's employment must be treated as also done by the employer.
Anything done by an agent for a principal, with the authority of the principal, must be treated as also done by the principal.
It does not matter whether that thing is done with the employer's or principal's knowledge or approval.
In proceedings against A's employer (B) in respect of anything alleged to have been done by A in the course of A's employment it is a defence for B to show that B took all reasonable steps to prevent A—
from doing that thing, or
from doing anything of that description.
…
Liability of employees and agents
A person (A) contravenes this section if—
A is an employee or agent,
A does something which, by virtue of section 109(1) or (2), is treated as having been done by A's employer or principal (as the case may be), and
the doing of that thing by A amounts to a contravention of this Act by the employer or principal (as the case may be).
It does not matter whether, in any proceedings, the employer is found not to have contravened this Act by virtue of section 109(4).
A does not contravene this section if—
A relies on a statement by the employer or principal that doing that thing is not a contravention of this Act, and
it is reasonable for A to do so.”
It is common ground on the appeal, as it was before the judge below, that Mr Meagher was absolutely entitled, subject to the case management powers of the Court, to plead an unlawful disability discrimination case against the Individuals under section 110 of the Act. As Ms Steinhardt submitted with justification, claims under section 110 are not somehow subordinate to, or additive to, claims brought under section 109. A claimant with an entitlement to bring claims under both sections has the right to choose to bring the claims under one section, or the other, or both, against the relevant parties.
It is also relevant to the arguments before the Judge, and before this Court, that that the University had disavowed in its Defence any intention to rely upon section 109(4) of the Act, which provides a defence to an employer in relation to discriminatory acts carried out by an employee where it has taken all reasonable steps to prevent the employee so acting.
In terms of the regime as applicable to claims brought under the Act against universities, it is also common ground that the statute specifically provides that such claims must be brought in the County Court. The University relies upon this to emphasise that in so doing, Parliament must be taken to have intended (in contrast to other types of discrimination claims which are to be brought in front of an Employment or First Tier Tribunal), that the case management powers inherent in the CPR, including the power to strike out where the claim is an abuse of process, were applicable. This is obviously right. However, it is also right that in requiring such claims to be brought before the County Court, as submitted by Ms Steinhardt, there has been imposed a case management structure on such cases in which costs are likely to be low and capable of management.
The Judgment Below : the Claims against the Individuals
At paragraph 41, the Judge identified that the starting point of the analysis was that the Claimant was entitled to bring claims against the employees undersection 110. At paragraphs 42 and 43, the Judge characterised the claims against the Individuals as being against them in their capacity as decision-makers or amongst the decision-makers. In a passage that was not at least directly the subject of complaint, the Judge concluded that ‘what is being complained about is not so much their individual acts of discrimination against the Claimant, but the effect of the decision making as agents for [the University], and in furtherance of [the University’s] obligations to the Claimant.’ At paragraph 44, the judge noted the University’s acknowledgement in its defence of its liability for any discrimination proved against the individual and the existence of his remedy in those circumstances against the University. The Judge observed at paragraphs 45-7 that the final injunctions sought would be ‘more appropriately’ granted against the University.
At paragraph 48, the Judge identified his assumption that the Claimant would effectively recover any damages from the University, such that adding the Individuals ‘does not really provide any substantive additional benefit to the Claimant in terms of damages’.  In paragraph 49, he identified the University’s argument that the Individuals would suffer detriment in the costs and time involved as defendants rather than merely witnesses. Paragraphs 50-51 dealt with a line of argument not relevant on appeal. At paragraph 52, the Judge identified the authority of Jameel, with the following summary:
“there will be cases where a claim is not worth the candle, in other words the costs of pursuing the action are so wholly disproportionate to what is actually involved and to the benefit the Claimant seeks, that it is an abuse of process for the Claimant to pursue it, bearing in mind the resources that are required of the Court and of the other party.”
At paragraph 53, the Judge noted that this question has to be approached ‘with a degree of care’, noting the Sullivan case referred to above. The exercise of discretion was then explained in the following paragraphs:
The question for me, though, that these two decisions highlight is whether it is proportionate for the Claimant to be pursuing the individual Defendants when, as Mr Knight submits, there is little for him to gain, as compared with the additional costs and detriment to them of them being parties. In my view, that really requires me to focus on the particular remedies that the Claimant might obtain against them if he is successful.
I have already commented on the fact that injunctions would be better framed against the First Defendant, and that a damages claim against the Personal Defendants does not really appear to add much of benefit to the Claimant, bearing in mind that the University will surely resolve any damages that are found in the Claimant’s favour.
The Claimant said however, that he relies on the individual acts of discrimination carried out by the individual Defendants, and he seeks declarations as to those acts of discrimination. Discrimination is of course a very important matter, and the remedies provided under the Equality Act are very important remedies. Discrimination is something to be taken very seriously. It is a wrong in itself, and it is a wrong that the Court is required to address when it is raised in appropriate proceedings.
On the other hand, Mr Knight is right when he says that the Court does not generally grant declarations that simply reflect findings that the Court has made in a judgment, and I would add to that that it is also a well-established principle that the Court will not grant declarations that are academic, in that they do not provide any substantial benefit to the party seeking them.
Mr Meagher’s submission is that the declarations he seeks would be of value to him because  they would, in effect, amount to vindication of his position. There is a tension between that of course, and his application that he be anonymised, because if he is right in that application then of course he will not achieve public vindication because he will not be identified with the declarations in question, but I suppose what he will achieve is a more general vindication of his position in the sense that the Court will declare that wrongs have happened which should not have happened, and that may be of value, I suppose he would say, in relation to other litigants or other matters that he is concerned with.
However, in my judgment it is necessary here to focus on his pleaded case, and in my judgment his pleaded case does not set out individual acts of discrimination perpetrated by the Second to Sixth Defendants which are in any way distinct from his claim against the University. The key point here is that the acts that they have perpetrated, or he alleges that they have perpetrated, are precisely the same acts that he relies on in his claim against the University, and in reality as his pleading is framed, he is not pursuing them as individuals in any way that is separate from their identity as agents and decision makers on behalf of the University.
There is no part of his pleading which as such identifies individual conduct and seeks an individual remedy from them in respect of it. Indeed, the remedy section of his pleading is couched in general terms, and he seeks precisely the same remedies against all of the Defendants without seeking to distinguish between particular Defendants in respect of the particular remedies that he seeks as a result of the particular conduct of each of them that he complains of.
In those circumstances, I am afraid to say it is very difficult to see what additional benefit bringing the claim against the Second to Sixth Defendants brings to this, and it seems to me that the claim can perfectly properly be pursued against the University with those additional Defendants being named and identified as part of the factual matrix that is relied upon by the Claimant to establish his claim against the University, and it is not necessary, and it is not proportionate, bearing in mind the pleaded issues as we currently stand, for them to be parties in order for the Claimant to properly pursue his case.
I have come to the conclusion, albeit I found it somewhat finely balanced bearing in mind section 110 of the Act, that this is one of those rare cases where in effect, it is disproportionate to be pursuing the action against these individuals in such a way that it does amount to the broader form of abuse of process identified in the Jameel case, and therefore that the claim against the individual Defendants should be struck out, and that the claim against the University should continue with them as the only Defendant.”
Grounds of Appeal 1-4
The grounds overlap.
Ground 1 asserts that the Judge ‘erroneously treated the claims as being subject to the Jameel jurisdiction, …when Jameel was concerned with whether a claim was brought in respect of matters that were more than de minimis, and not with the question of whether a claim which was concerned with matters that were more than de minimis could be brought against multiple alleged joint tortfeasors.’
Ground 2 asserts that the Judge, ‘wrongly regarded the fact that one alleged joint tortfeasor was in a position to meet any financial award that made as a reason supporting the striking out of claims against other alleged joint tortfeasors.’
Ground 3 asserts that the Judge ‘failed to have any or any sufficient regard to the fact that parliament had conferred on claimants in discrimination claims an unfettered right to pursue claims against alleged individual discriminators as well as against alleged corporate discriminators.’
Ground 4 asserts that the Judge ‘failed to have any or any sufficient regard to the importance of claims under the Equality Act, and the undesirability of striking out such claims without a full examination of the facts on which they are based’.
As Mr Knight for the University observed, the arguments advanced orally by Ms Steinhardt on behalf of Mr Meagher ranged at times considerably more broadly than the Grounds of Appeal, and indeed than the Skeleton Argument in support of those grounds. Grounds 1 and 2 of the Appellant’s Grounds of Appeal and skeleton argument largely focussed on arguments of principle – that the Judge was simply not empowered to do what he did in the context of a multi-defendant section 109/section 110 discrimination case; Grounds 3 and 4 relate to the weight given to two specific factors. There is no direct attack on the issue of proportionality on which Ms Steinhardt focussed much of her oral submissions. Ms Steinhardt sought to characterise the expansion of her arguments as putting flesh to the bones of the Grounds. I consider that they went beyond that.  No application to amend the Grounds was made.
Ground 1 was argued in the Appellant’s skeleton as an error or misdirection of law. It was said that Jameel is not authority for the proposition that a valuable claim against one defendant can be dismissed because a judge considers that another jointly liable defendant is sufficiently solvent to meet any award made.  It was argued that the Judge wrongly interpreted Jameel which was concerned with the value of the claim itself, not with the identity of the parties to it.  In oral argument, Ms Steinhardt, correctly in my judgment, stepped back from any submission suggested by Ground 1 that it was, as a matter of law, simply not open to the Judge below even to consider carrying out a proportionality/weighing exercise (put bluntly: is the claim worth the candle?) in the context of a discrimination case, merely because the claim is one brought under the Act. Ms Steinhardt rightly recognised that such an assessment pursuant to CPR 3.4(b) is equally possible in principle in the present case, notwithstanding the fact that this is a claim under the Act. Insofar as a claim is required to be brought pursuant to a procedure subject to the CPR, it is plain that it is open to the Court to apply general principles of case management to any and all cases before it. In this respect, the Judge was right to consider that the type of abuse of process considered in Jameel was one which could be applicable in this case. There was no misdirection of law by the Judge in considering the potential applicability of striking out under 3.4(b) in line with the Jameel line of authorities.
Ground 2 is equally unsustainable insofar as it is to be construed as limited to as the identification of an error of general principle or misdirection of law.  AB is clear authority for the proposition that, in an appropriate case, a court may exercise its case management powers to stop an action against some tortfeasors and not others if the action against some (and not others) is ‘not worth the candle’. Of course, in AB, the claims against the struck out tortfeasors were contingent, and this was of importance in the decision making (see the reasoning at [p.111]), but that is not a feature which determines the application of the principle one way or the other; it is a factor (and might be an important factor) in the overall assessment process. In oral submissions the same point was made by Ms Steinhardt by focussing on the Judge’s use of the term ‘additional’ when considering the question of the benefit derived to the claimant for including the Individuals within the litigation. It was suggested that it was wrong in principle to do so, as it demonstrated that the Judge perceived the section 110 claims as somehow subsidiary to the section 109 claim. I do not agree. The Judge’s use of language was merely reflecting the reality of the shape of the litigation, the context of the fact that the claim against the University was proceeding. In this context, it is of note that Ms Steinhardt conceded, again rightly in my view, that had the application been to amend a claim which had been commenced only against the University, the Court would have been entitled to consider what benefit to the litigation as whole the addition of the Individuals would bring when considering whether to permit the amendment (in a similar way to the assessment of cost v benefit analysis undertaken by the Court in MBR Acres v Free the MBR Beagles [2022] EWHC 1677 (QB): see paragraphs 28, 50 and 57).  It is right that the test and the burden upon amendment is different to the test and burden under CPR3.4 (b), but the analogy demonstrates that it does not follow that in circumstances where the Court is considering as part of its case management whether some aspects of the claim are ‘not worth the candle’ it cannot look to the reality of the litigation and the interaction between the allegations made against different parties. The factors in this case – that the University would be the party in fact paying any damages; that it was the proper party against whom any injunctive relief could be sought; and there was no risk that the University would not meet any judgment of the Court – were not themselves disputed. These factors cannot be said, as a matter of principle, to be irrelevant to and wrongly included within the assessment of the proportionality of pursuing the claims against the Individuals in the Jameel sense.
In relation to Ground 3, the Judge clearly started his analysis by identifying the clear right of the Claimant to bring its claim against individuals under section 110 instead of or additional to a claim against a corporate entity under section 109.   In these circumstances, Ground 3 is unsustainable insofar as it asserts a misdirection of law or the exclusion from consideration of a relevant factor: the judge was fully aware of the Claimant’s ‘right’ to bring a claim under section 110 of the Act. Indeed, this was his express starting point (see paragraph 41).  It is not, as a matter of law, the necessary finishing point, as this Ground implies. This is because the right (at least where exercised in the County Court in proceedings subject to the CPR) will always be susceptible to being ‘fettered’ by an appropriate case management decision, in the same way that the ‘right’ to bring a coherent legal claim was effectively fettered by the case management decisions in Jameel and Sullivan. The argument that the Court ‘is not empowered to deprive’ a claimant of the choice is akin to the arguments advanced and defeated in AB and Jameel. The Court is so empowered in the appropriate case.
In respect of Ground 4, Ms Steinhardt relied upon Anyanwu v South Bank Student Union [2001] UKHL 14 [2001] 1 WLR 638. That case rightly emphasised the fact-sensitive nature of discrimination cases, and the importance of the merits or demerits of such cases being determined on the facts to the broader public interest.  However, it cannot be said that the Judge failed to weigh in the balance the relevant fact that this was a discrimination case and this of itself is an important matter in the context of the assessment: he did so clearly at paragraph 56 of his judgment.
Returning to the test on appeals against case management decisions as set out at [24] above, the Appellant has not made out any misdirection in law by the judge. Each of the matters which the Judge considered was a matter which he was entitled to consider as being relevant, and the Appellant has not pointed to a particular relevant feature of the case that the judge failed to consider. No procedural unfairness or irregularity has been identified.
The only remaining basis of appeal available, therefore, is that the exercise of discretion by the Judge was ‘plainly wrong’.  It is no doubt for this reason that in her oral argument, Ms Steinhardt wrapped her argument in the broad submission that each of the main cases demonstrating the exercise of discretion under this limb of CPR 3.4 (b), such as Jameel, AB, and Sullivan, illustrated the extreme nature of disproportionality and potential injustice which must exist before the bringing of a viable claim can be considered abusive. She submitted that such disproportionality simply does not exist in the present case, particularly when the importance of the ability to bring section 110 discrimination claims in addition to section 109 has a strong public interest element as well.
It would be an over-generous reading of the Grounds of Appeal to consider that such a general attack on the exercise of discretion formed a part of the appeal.  Nevertheless, in case I am wrong about this, I consider the issue on the basis that this way of putting the appeal was open to the Appellant. Even though the Judge did not misdirect himself of the potential applicability of the Jameel type approach, nor misunderstand the fact that such cases would be rare, nor include irrelevant factors or exclude relevant factors, I therefore ask whether the exercise of his discretion was ‘plainly wrong’. I remind myself that it will be rare that a judge who has exercised a discretion having regard to relevant considerations will have come to a conclusion outside that ambit permitted to them.
The Judge was not plainly wrong.  The Judge’s characterisation of the substance of the claim against the Individuals – which characterisation was not challenged on appeal (and which was, in any event, correct) –  was that the case advanced against the Individuals is not dependent upon any particular discriminatory act attributable personally to them. The Individuals have been included, in reality, simply because of their standing within the committees of the University which were responsible for the decisions against which the allegation of discrimination is made. It was plainly of some importance to the Judge that the claims made were not in substance personal against the Individuals, with those personal acts of discrimination or victimisation then being attributed vicariously to the employer;  instead he considered, and with justification, that the relevant part of the pleaded claim focusses upon decisions made at an institutional/committee level within the University – for which there is no dispute that the University will be responsible should they be of the character ascribed to them in the pleading - and these decisions are then effectively attributed personally to the Chairs of the relevant committees irrespective of any particular act or otherwise of that Individual, simply by virtue of their position as Chair or Co-Chair of that committee. On the Appellant’s logic, the claim could extend to including as Defendants each and every member of each of the committees involved in the decision-making about which complaint is made irrespective of how burdensome such an approach would be for the Court managing such a claim or to the individuals themselves, and notwithstanding that such an approach would provide no actual benefit to the Claimant by way of outcome. The reality of the nature of the claims against the Individuals is also illustrated by the fact that the Appellant’s allegations about a relevant committee’s decision could succeed against the University even where the particular Individual included as Defendant voted against the majority within the relevant committee such that the impugned decision for which the Individual stands ‘responsible’ as Chair of the committee was made despite, rather than because of, the Individual’s actions. The Judge was plainly justified in concluding that (to adopt the wording of Warby J in The Duchess of Sussex), the heart of this particular case is about the institutional decisions made by the relevant committees within the University, for which the University will be liable if discriminatory, rather than any particular identifiable discriminatory acts by the particular Individuals.
In light of this characterisation of the pleaded case against the Individuals, the Judge was entitled to conclude, on the facts of this case and notwithstanding the statutory entitlement to bring section 110 claims against the Individuals, that their involvement as separate defendants added material complexity and cost, but no benefit of substance to the Claimant.  This is far removed from the more usual section 109/110 discrimination case where the case will focus on the personal discriminatory actions of particular individuals, whether or not they are included as Defendants, and then attribute these actions to the employer pursuant to section 109, not only so as to ensure that there is a party with the relevant pockets/insurance to ensure that a successful claim for damages is satisfied but also so that the individual’s responsibility for discriminatory behaviour is subject to specific investigation and judgment, in respect of which there is clearly a public interest. It is no doubt because of the particular characteristics of this case that the Judge correctly considered this case to be a rare one.
Having considered this particular context and the justified fact that the actual benefit of including these individual representatives of the University’s decision-making committees, in addition to the University itself, was in practical terms nil, it was for the Judge to weigh their continued involvement and the Claimant’s right of action against them, against the inevitable additional costs and complexity of the Individuals being involved. Whilst it is undoubtedly right that that the additional cost was not going to be ‘exorbitant’ in absolute terms, the actual impact of personal involvement in litigation of this nature beyond merely participation as a witness cannot be underestimated. The Judge was also justified in concluding that any desire for vindication against an Individual would be satisfied in substance, to the extent warranted in due course, by the public judgment, and that the individuals were not the appropriate target for the sought injunctive relief which could only sensibly be instituted, if ordered, by the University. Ms Steinhardt’s belated argument (in reply) that the Individuals’ involvement could be justified on the ground that it entitled the Appellant to disclosure against the Individuals was not one made in front of the Judge below, and a contention that the Judge failed to consider this as relevant was not a Ground of Appeal. In any event, in light of the nature of the claims against the Individuals, only those documents in their possession in the context of their acting as the Chair or Co-Chair of the relevant committee (and thus as agent for the University) would be relevant and such documents would be discoverable against the University. Personal allegations against the Individuals justifying some wider disclosure are not part of the case.
The Judge recognised the decision was finely balanced. It was for the Judge managing the case to weigh whether the extent to which permitting the viable claims against the Individuals was so disproportionate so as to be an abuse of process in the Jameel sense. It was open to him to determine that the claims against the Individuals were ‘not worth the candle’.  It was a decision within the range of decisions a judge properly exercising their case management discretion could come to, on the particular facts of this case. Even if the Grounds of Appeal had included a broad complaint about the wrongful exercise of discretion rather than the four particular errors of principle alleged, the appeal would not have succeeded.
Grounds 5 and 6
These Grounds relate to the striking out by the Judge of paragraphs 69(3) and 70(3) of the draft APoC. Paragraph 69 alleges that the University is in breach of its obligation to provide educational services to the Claimant with reasonable care and skill. The particular at 69(3) pleaded was, ‘the [University] failed to ensure that the Claimant’s viva was conducted in accordance with the adjustments recommended by the ADRC (this failure was a breach of contract whether or not it was also an act of unlawful discrimination’. Paragraph 70(3) was a particular drafted in materially identical terms, said to be a breach of the University’s common law duty of care to perform the educational services that it provided to the Claimant with reasonable care and skill and/or take reasonable steps to prevent the Claimant from suffering personal injury, including psychological harm etc, (pleaded at paragraphs 14 and 15 of the APoC).
The Judge struck paragraphs 69(3) and 70(3) out as the paragraphs were an attempt to import the duty to make reasonable adjustments imposed by the Equality Act 2010 into the contractual terms and/or the tortious duty of care.   The key paragraphs of the Judgment were as follows:
In my judgment, this is a clear attempt to read duties imposed by the Equality Act across into ingredients of a duty of care, and it is impermissible for the reasons that are set out in the case of Smeaton v Equifax Plc [2013] EWCA Civ 108. In that case, which was concerned with slightly different subject matter, there was consideration of the extent to which statutory duties gave rise to duties of care in tort or other tortious duties, and it was held that in general, they do not.
Thomas LJ then referred to a dicta of Lord Hoffmann in the case of Her Majesty’s Customs and Excise Commissioners v Barclays Bank Plc [2006] UKHL 28, at paragraph 39 where Lord Hoffmann said:
“The question of whether the order, that is a statutory instrument, can have generated a duty of care is comparable with the question of whether a statutory duty can generate a common law duty of care. The answer is that it cannot.”
Lord Hoffmann referred to Gorringe v Calderdale Metropolitan Borough Council [2004] UKHL 15:
“The statute either creates a statutory duty or it does not (that is not to say as I already mentioned that conduct undertaken pursuant to a statutory duty cannot generate a duty of care, in the same way as the same conduct undertaken voluntarily) that you cannot derive a common law duty of care directly from a statutory duty.”
In my judgment, the Claimant is trying here to do precisely what Lord Hoffmann said cannot be done, which is to simply import a duty imposed by the Equality Act into, and as a component of, the implied term of reasonable skill and care, and/or a duty of care in tort. A set of reasons why that is impermissible is because as Mr Knight submitted, it is otiose and duplicative.
The Equality Act creates a duty to make reasonable adjustments. That duty has either been complied with or it has not been complied with. The analysis of whether there is a duty of care, whether in tort or its equivalent in contract, does not assist really to determine whether the duty has been complied with or has not been complied with. The duty exists independent of whether there is any duty of care or not, and it is not an ingredient of a duty of care. The duty is not to exercise reasonable skill to provide reasonable adjustments, the duty under statute is to provide them, and if they are not provided then there is a breach of the duty.
Furthermore, to be able to bring a claim in contract or in tort does, I agree with Mr Knight, undermine the scheme of the Equality Act. Discrimination is a wrong in itself, and the Equality Act provides remedies for it outside of any other scheme of remedies or cause of action. The obligation to make reasonable adjustments is a specific ingredient of the duties owed under the Equality Act.
Discrimination claims can obviously arise in cases where there is a contract between parties, and in cases where there is no contract between parties, precisely because it is a freestanding statutory wrong, in respect of which the statute provides remedies. The statute provides a clear statutory scheme for dealing with claims, including that such claims are allocated in the first instance to the County Court, where proceedings must be issued in the first instance even if they can be transferred to the High Court subsequently if they meet the requirements for such transfer.
It defines the scope of the claims, that is the parts of the Act that are justiciable by the County Court, and some which are not, and it deliberately imposes a short limitation period to ensure that discrimination claims are dealt with expeditiously and not left to linger for potentially the longer limitation periods that are provided for contract and tort respectively.
The liability of employers is defined by the Act but it is also subject to defined defences, and again, the statute there is creating rights and duties which are different from, and independent of any such rights or duties which might exist in contract or tort.
It is true that there is no authority that the parties have been able to find or refer to me which has decided in terms that the duty to make reasonable adjustments cannot, or does not give rise to a duty of care in tort or form part of the implied obligation to exercise reasonable skill and care in contract. The closest they have come in terms of citation of authority appears to be the case of The University of Bristol v Dr Abrahart (as administrator of the estate of Natasha Abrahart deceased), in which Linden J made some comment in the context of an application for permission to appeal, about whether there could be a duty of care in negligence alongside a discrimination claim.
In short, he indicated that he considered that the parties’ positions were well arguable, but decided that he was not going to decide the issue because it raised issues of potentially wide application and significance that would be better off dealt with elsewhere, and because ultimately it did not affect the outcome of his decision, but that is not a decision which is binding on me, it is simply comment by the judge in the context of granting permission to appeal, and it is well understood that decisions in relation to permission to appeal are not regarded as authoritative, and should not be cited as authoritative when citing authorities.
I recognise that in general terms the Court should not strike out a case if there is a significant doubt as to the law that applies, but should instead allow the case to be determined on its facts before coming to views about the law, but it is not clear to me what a determination on the facts would add to my analysis.
My analysis assumes that the Claimant will be able to make good his fundamental allegation that the University failed to make reasonable adjustments, or to secure that reasonable adjustments were made in the conduct of his viva, but it seems to me that even assuming that to be true, for the reasons that I have given, it is simply not permissible to read the duty in the Equality Act across and treat it as an ingredient of a duty of care, whether in tort or the equivalent in contract.
Given that the Claimant has not pleaded the equivalent of any breach of any alleged express term of the contract, I consider that these two paragraphs should be struck out of the amended particulars of claim.”
Ground 5 asserts that the Judge erroneously treated paragraphs 69(3) and 70(3) as an attempt to import the statutory duty to make reasonable adjustments pursuant to the Equality Act into the contractual terms and/or into a tortious duty of care; and Ground 6 asserts that the Judge erroneously regarded the fact that a breach of statutory duty to make reasonable adjustments was actionable under the Equality Act as precluding a claim in contract or tort as a result of the same matters.
In short, the Appellant does not challenge the Smeaton line of authority or suggest that the Appellant’s case is that the contractual or tortious duty of care alleged is born directly from the existence of the statutory duty. Instead, the case depends specifically upon the allegation that the University’s own ADRC made recommendations and that, such recommendations having been made (and irrespective of the statutory duty), there was then a contractual or tortious duty of care to take reasonable steps to implement the recommendations. The case does not, in other words, leapfrog straight from statute to duty/breach (which would be impermissible pursuant to Smeaton), but depends critically upon the fact alleged that the ADRC made recommendations.
The Judge did indeed fall into error in his understanding of this aspect of the pleaded case. The starting point is the alleged existence of the contractual and/or tortious duties pleaded at paragraphs 14 and 15. These paragraphs were not, and could not properly have been, struck out. The particulars of breach then allege that, in circumstances where the ADRC had made recommendations, there was a failure of the pleaded duty not to put into place those recommendations. This is a case which is entirely distinct from the duty under the Act and it is not a case which offends against the principle in Smeaton. In eliding this particular of breach with the case under the Act, the Judge failed to recognise that there were two parallel but distinct cases.  By way of illustration, it may be that (as a matter of fact), the recommendations made by the ADRC would or would not have met the statutory duty pursuant to the Act. A failure to take reasonable steps to implement them may, in theory at least, be a breach of the alleged contractual and/or tortious duties irrespective of whether any such failure also amounted to a breach of the Act.  Conversely, even if the University did take reasonable steps to implement the ADRC recommendations, this is not determinative of any case under the Act.
As such, the Judge should not have struck paragraphs 69(3) and 70(3) out, and they should be reinstated.

APPROVED JUDGMENT
This judgment was handed down by release to the National Archives on Monday 13 January 2025 at 10:30am.
Lord Justice Edis:
This is an appeal against a confiscation order which was made in the Crown Court by consent.  We heard full argument on 21 November 2024 and granted leave and the necessary very long extension of time.  We adjourned the hearing part heard until 18 December 2024 in order that we could hear evidence from the appellant and from counsel and solicitors who represented him in the Crown Court.  They advised him, negotiated the settlement on his behalf and consented to the order being made.  The appellant was not present at the hearing when that took place, and much of the contact between him and his lawyers occurred by way of telephone calls and occasional video conferences because he was serving a sentence of imprisonment, and there were significant restrictions on access to prisoners because of COVID 19.  In these circumstances we felt it appropriate to investigate the events which led the appellant to consent to the order with particular care.
We heard evidence and further argument on 18 December 2024 and reserved our decision.  We also asked for some further documentation and gave Mr. Bott KC the opportunity to make further written submissions by 20 December.  We received those documents and submissions in time.
On 24 December the court communicated with the appellant’s solicitors to inform them that the appeal would be dismissed and that we would give our reasons in writing on 13 January 2025.  We now give those reasons.
Mr. Charles Bott KC has conducted this appeal on behalf of the appellant, initially pro bono, but on 21 November 2024 we granted a representation order when giving leave.  Mr. Bott had represented the appellant at his trial, but not during the confiscation or enforcement proceedings.  Mr. Michael Newbold was not counsel for the Crown at the confiscation hearing (where the Crown was represented by Mr Ian Cook).  We are extremely grateful to both counsel for their clear and helpful presentation of a complex case.
Conviction and sentence
On 22 March 2018, in the Crown Court at Leeds (His Honour Judge R Jameson KC), the appellant (then aged 46) was convicted of cheating the public revenue.  On 26 March 2018, he was sentenced to 9 years’ imprisonment.  His  renewed application for leave to appeal against his conviction was refused by this Court on 6 March 2019.
On 13 December 2018, he admitted breaching a restraint order which had been made by the Crown Court in Leeds on 18 June 2015, and was sentenced to a further six months’ imprisonment consecutive to the sentence already being served.
The confiscation proceedings
On 26 March 2018 an order was made under section 18(2) of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 requiring the appellant to disclose full details of his assets, and identified in detail a number of matters in respect of which disclosure was required.  The order identified a list of 58 properties in the United Kingdom, with addresses and title numbers.  This was a portfolio of cheap buy-to-let properties bought with the assistance of mortgages.  It also contained a list of 16 bank accounts in various names in banks all round the world.  The prosecution position, which they wished to investigate further with disclosure, was that a substantial part of the proceeds of the fraud had been remitted to offshore corporate bank accounts and then laundered.  On the same date, a timetable for confiscation proceedings was established.  This was later varied.
The appellant supplied his answers to the section 18(2) Order on 21 September 2018.  This gave a list of 79 UK properties and said:-
“Please note Receivers have now been appointed over 2 of the aforementioned properties mortgaged by the Northern Rock and I expect the Birmingham Midshires to appoint Receivers over the remaining 15 properties imminently.”
It also added this, about those properties:-
“I do not have access to any debts which may be in existence in relation to the properties specified at No.3.  I believe that the accounts in relation to those properties are already lodged with the prosecution authorities, and therefore any debts will be within their knowledge.”
The properties were all mortgaged and the mortgagees, it would appear, were actively seeking sale.  They were subject to a restraining order made on 18 June 2015.  Experience suggests that when properties are sold in circumstances like this there is often nothing left for the mortgagor once the mortgagee has been paid the outstanding debt, interest and enforcement costs.
The appellant instructed Mr. Nicholas Hammond, then a solicitor and now a member of the Bar, in 2018.  Mr. Andrew Haslam KC and Beverley Ibbotson, a forensic accountant, were instructed by him subsequently.   Work on preparing the case for hearing went on throughout 2019.  In March 2020, while much remained to be done, the COVID pandemic caused significant difficulties in accessing prisoners.  These were not resolved at any time prior to the hearing of the confiscation proceedings and were exacerbated when the appellant himself became seriously ill with COVID.  The appellant was not allowed a laptop for some reason and Mr. Hammond had to arrange for his wife to access materials so that they could be printed and sent into him in the prison.   Ms. Ibbotson nevertheless produced a report on 25 June 2020 which was disclosed in order to advance the appellant’s case.
On 26 April 2021, the appellant was ordered to pay a Confiscation Order for £1,112,670.24, under Section 6 of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (‘POCA’). To be paid within 3 months, or in default to serve 7 years’ imprisonment.  The order was made by consent.  Mr. Haslam KC appeared for the appellant, who was not present, and confirmed his agreement to the order being made.  The order identified the benefit figure as £5,915,191.77.  The available amount and the benefit figure were both the result of negotiation, being significantly lower than the figures for which the prosecution contended.  The negotiations had been going on since the end of 2020 when the appellant’s solicitors first intimated that they expected to make an offer.  The negotiations occurred in correspondence and in oral discussions between the legal teams, including direct discussions between Mr. Haslam and Mr. Cook.  The offer was linked to the value of two particular assets, namely (1) what remained of the portfolio of UK properties listed in the section 18 Order, and (2) the value of a debt.
The appellant accepts that he gave Mr. Hammond instructions by telephone that the benefit figure and the realisable amount figure contained in the order should be agreed by Mr. Haslam on his behalf.
On 13 July 2021 time to pay the Confiscation Order was extended by 3 months, to 21 October 2021.
On 22 November 2022, Leeds District Magistrates’ Court activated the default prison sentence for non-payment and committed the applicant to prison (2317 days). The appellant was in custody at the time the appeal was heard, serving this default prison sentence. A total of £104,725.24 had been paid towards the order in a series of payments in 2021 and 2022 (prior to committal in default). Those payments were taken into account when the Magistrates' Court calculated the relevant part of the default term which the Appellant was ordered to serve in November 2022.
The appellant sought to judicially review the decision by Leeds District Magistrates’ Court to commit him to prison in default of payment. Permission to apply for judicial review at the Administrative Court was granted on the papers on 1 September 2023. The substantive judicial review application was dismissed following a hearing (before Mr Richard Wright KC, sitting as a Deputy High Court Judge) on 16 November 2023, see [2023] EWHC 3420 (Admin).
The appeal in a nutshell
The appellant contends that the two assets on the basis of which he made an offer to consent to an available amount figure of £1,112,670.24 were in fact not available to him at the date of the order.  He had thought that there were 16 properties remaining in the portfolio and there were in fact none, or at least none with any equity available to him.  He believed that the debt was recoverable but it was not because the company which was to receive the money and pass it to him (Nudge Limited) had been removed from the company register in Gibraltar a few weeks before the order was made, and he was not aware of this.
The ground of appeal says:-
“The Confiscation Order, terms of which were agreed in good faith at the time, was made on a basis which was incorrect. The assumed realisable assets had included two items (a UK property portfolio said to be worth £713,842 and the applicant’s 30% share of a liability owed to Trilindist (UAE) Ltd by Nudge Ltd valued at £306,015.00), which were not and are not in fact available to the applicant in order to satisfy the Confiscation Order. The applicant, who was in custody serving his sentence at the time, did not attend the Confiscation hearing and owing to the strict regime which applied during the Covid pandemic, he had had limited access to documents and to legal advice.  The Court is respectfully invited to quash the Confiscation Order and to substitute it with an order, in the lesser sum, which does not treat the two items as part of the available amount.”
This means, so it is said, that the Crown Court has no jurisdiction to reduce the order and that the appellant is serving a sentence when he has no means of paying the Confiscation Order.  This is unjust and this court has the power to remedy that injustice.
If, as is now said, the two assets were worth nothing on the 26 April 2021, then the only available assets were those which resulted in the payments of £104,725.24 in 2021 and 2022.  If the benefit figure of £5,915,191.77 is right, this means that the appellant has managed to dissipate of £5,810,466.53 of the proceeds of his fraud without having anything at all to show for it.
The offending
The appellant’s conviction arose from a fraud in which falsified invoices were submitted to HMRC in support of VAT claims for the period 11 October 2011 and 19 January 2015 in relation to the trading of ‘data leads’. The total value of the fraud was said at trial to be approximately £9 million.
Data leads were used by companies for targeting advertising and marketing, as they were essentially a list of individuals who had previously expressed an interest in the commodity that the company wished to sell to them. The bulk of the leads in the UK were supplied by a group of nine companies who were referred to as the ""Big 9"". A company known as International Media Distribution purported to buy data leads from the Big 9 companies. Invoices, which included 20% VAT, were created for the transactions. The data leads were then sold to a series of intermediate companies tasked with removing any duplicate names and addresses for a modest profit. The data leads were then sold on to a company based in Gibraltar, before the final sale to another company based in the USA. As a result of selling the data leads to companies in Gibraltar (a country outside the European Union), VAT could not be recovered from the final sale price. Applications were made to the HMRC to reclaim the unrecovered VAT purportedly paid to the Big 9 companies for the initial acquisition of the data leads. The prosecution case was that the appellant controlled various companies within the structure and that he had knowledge of the fraudulent activity which was taking place.
The value of the fraud was, therefore, 20% of the initial purchase price of the data leads.  When considering the value of any assets which may now be available to the appellant, it is relevant to observe that the profit on the sale of the data leads is not included in that value.
The appeal
Fresh evidence:- The appellant seeks leave pursuant to Section 23 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1968 to rely on his Witness Statement dated 19 August 2023.  Although no criticism of solicitors or counsel is made in the ground, it plainly involves an examination of the circumstances in which the appellant gave his consent to the making of an order which he now says was based on two factual misunderstandings.  Most of the property portfolio had in fact already been sold by the Receiver before the order was made, and the figure was in any event included in the available assets in too high a sum.  The appellant’s witness statement of August 2023 explains that months after the order had been made he was checking the figures and realised that:-
“The figure of £713,842 was wrong. It had looked like the calculation contained items for tainted gifts of £379,260 which should indeed have been separated and/or removed prior to the drafting of the final order. This appeared to have been overlooked by both HMRC and my advisors. HMRC had agreed that this be removed in the section 16 statement dated 12th April 21, 9 days before the final order was agreed.”
Nudge Limited did not repay the debt to Trilindist (UAE) Limited.  The appellant’s witness statement says this:-
“The overseas equity held in Nudge Limited was to be realised by the repayment of a loan from a borrower named Brand Apps Limited. Nudge was struck off the company register shortly before the final POCA settlement. I had no knowledge that this had occurred. This asset was genuinely included as realisable - perhaps HMRC and or my lawyers should have checked the company status prior to the settlement but I certainly had no idea whilst confined to a cell.
An overseas agent was appointed to re-instate the company but this was refused by the Gibraltar authorities. Copies of these documents have been provided.”
The appellant says that prior to the order being agreed, he had no way of checking the correctness of the figure of £713,842.    The figure was said to represent the value of the appellant’s interest in a portfolio of UK properties which had been bought with mortgages as “buy to let” investments.  They were all subject to a restraining order from the very start of the criminal proceedings: it was made on 18 June 2015.  That order contained a long list of properties.  However, the lenders were able to seek possession and a variation of the order and so the property portfolio could reduce despite the order.  By the time the confiscation order was made he had been in prison for over three years and his ability to keep track of these restrained assets was limited.
The response
The respondent accepts that the facts identified above are correct, and that Nudge Limited had ceased to exist before the making of the order which included a debt which it was due to repay, and that the figure of £713,842 was overstated in error, and included properties which had been sold before the date of the order.
The prosecution contends that these facts should not lead the court to allow an appeal against the confiscation order both by reference to the facts of this case and by reference to decided authority.
We have now had an extended opportunity to review the material which the parties had prepared for the confiscation hearing in the Crown Court and it is plain that the business affairs of the appellant were extremely complex.  The prosecution contended that there was a very large shortfall between the assets which had been identified as being available and the benefit figure.  The difference between the figures which ended up in the order was £4,802,521.53.  The prosecution contended that the appellant had failed to prove that the available amount was less than the benefit figure and this should lead to a confiscation order in a much higher amount than that contended for by the appellant.  This is a line of argument often called “hidden assets”.  There was evidence to support the argument, and this created the risk of a much higher order with a much higher default term, and a liability to pay the whole order enduring for life even after serving that term.  The prosecution say that the appellant secured a significant benefit by putting forward the figures which were reflected in the order and may have preserved substantially greater assets by doing so.
The prosecution also rely on Regina v Hirani [2008] EWCA Crim 1463 at [35] (Hirani), and submit that the appellant has not established that “the most exceptional circumstances” apply.  That judgment says:-
Additionally, the appellant was not representing that he had assets of £110,000.  He was prepared to agree that figure as a matter of compromise to avoid  additional potential liability. Similarly, the prosecution were not representing by this agreement that the appellant had no more than £110,000. This was in effect a consent order in which the appellant had bought off risk, both as to the amount of the confiscation order and the period he would be allowed to meet it. … .
In other jurisdictions, those who have entered into consent orders may set them aside on very narrow grounds. We do not exclude the possibility in the arena of confiscation orders that such circumstances might conceivably arise. But we do not consider that they arise where the essence of the complaint is that, in seeking to secure the best deal available, erroneous advice was given to one of those who was party to the agreement, save in the most exceptional circumstances. We would not wish to identify exhaustively what those circumstances might be but, in our judgment, there would need to be a well-founded submission that the whole process was unfair. We do not consider that the circumstances of this case come close to that.”
It is right to record that the appellant denies that there ever were hidden assets.
What the lawyers say
Mr. Hammond resists a suggestion that the enforcement proceedings in the magistrates’ court were deliberately delayed so that the appellant could be released before the default term was imposed and access his hidden assets.  He says that the delays were caused by the familiar litany of events which have afflicted the criminal justice system since the pandemic.  He also says that the appellant never mentioned any hidden assets to him.  He says this in his statement:-
I also wish to add that the POCA order was not made in the knowledge that the figures were wrong but it was made on the assumption that if they were wrong they could be corrected/amended by the section 23 process . D was advised accordingly.”
It is agreed before us that this advice was wrong, and there is no route under the process established in section 23 of the 2002 Act by which the appellant can advance the case he makes in this appeal.  We proceed on this basis, without deciding the question.  Should the appellant seek to persuade the Crown Court that it does have jurisdiction to vary the Order under section 23, the Crown Court will have to decide whether that is right or not and this judgment is silent on that question.
Mr. Hammond deals with the appellant’s consent to the making of the order quite briefly.  He says this:-
The POCA proceedings had been dragging on, as is sadly in the nature of such proceedings, and a time arrived where an agreement on the benefit figure and the available amount was reached with the Prosecution. D had advice not just from me but from Leading Counsel, Andrew Haslam KC. The Prosecution and the Defence came to an agreement
D was advised not simply to agree figures just for the sake of getting the Order over the line but nonetheless there was an estimation, born of pragmatism, of the figures although the available amount was based on figures which the Prosecution was happy that could be achieved. Bearing in mind the restraint, and this point is worth repeating, they were in possession of information which would have assisted them in coming to that figure.”
No attendance notes have been supplied to record the giving of advice and the receipt of instructions.
Mr. Haslam KC was invited to answer some questions by the Registrar.  He said this:-
Q1: “The reasons for the applicant not being in attendance when the confiscation order was made at the hearing on 26 April 2021. The Crown Court’s log for the hearing on 29/03/2021 has the following recorded:
Case to be listed on 26 April 2021
POCCA [sic] final hearing
Time estimate 3 days
It does not heed [sic] to be before HHJ Jameson QC
Deft to be produced.
However, it is not clear from the papers why the applicant did not then appear/be produced on 26 April 2021.”
Answer: the applicant told us he did not want to attend the hearing on 26th  of April 2021. For the avoidance of any doubt, the applicant fully consented to the making of the order in his absence. Mr Hammond and I had a conference [by telephone] with the applicant before and after the hearing. My recollection is that HMP Lindholme [where the applicant was remanded in custody] did not allow prison visits at the time of the hearing because of the Covid-19 pandemic.
Q2: “Were the figures provided for consideration by the Crown Court on 26 April 2021 not the final figures? Please see Para. 15 of the second witness statement by Nicholas Hammond, dated 15 April 2024.”  [this is set out at [24] above].
Answer: the figures provided for consideration by the Crown Court on 26th of April 2021 were ‘the final figures’ as understood by the defence [the applicant, Mr Hammond and myself] and the prosecution.
The oral evidence
On 18 December 2024 we heard oral evidence from the appellant, Mr. Andrew Haslam KC, and Mr. Nicholas Hammond.  There appear to be very few written records of the discussions which took place with the appellant before the order was made, and both of the lawyers had less than perfect recollections of the events in detail.  The key events took place in late 2020 and continued up to April 2021.  Both of them will have conducted a lot of cases since.  No written memorandum of the advice given or the appellant’s consent to the order was created which is perhaps a little surprising given the amount of money involved and the complexity of the appellant’s financial affairs.  All three witnesses agree that the appellant was advised that if the figures for the values of the assets which were being put forward on his behalf proved not to be realisable then a “certificate of inadequacy” could be obtained from the Crown Court.  It does not appear that any potential obstacles to this course were discussed with him.
The phrase “certificate of inadequacy” actually relates to the predecessor legislation to the 2002 Act, see section 83 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988, but it is clear that the lawyers were actually advising about the correct provision, namely section 23 of the 2002 Act.  On the basis recorded at [33] above, we proceed on the basis that this advice was wrong, without deciding whether that is right or not.
The appellant told us that he had understood that if the figures for the value of assets turned out to be wrong then the court could vary the order.  By the time when he was discussing with Mr. Hammond what the available amount was, he knew that there were 16 properties left which were considered as available.  He said he had no real idea what they were worth, but simply agreed the figure put forward by the financial investigator.  That figure was £320,000, which was too high as things turned out.  It was then increased to £713,842 in the final order by adding a further amount for “tainted gifts” which was a mistake because it had been agreed that this would be omitted.  The problem with that is that this figure of £713,842 was put forward by Mr. Hammond on behalf of the appellant in a schedule of his assets emailed to the prosecution in March 2021.  This says:-
UK property portfolio £713,842”
The financial investigator said in his final statement dated 12 April 2021:-
“I have accepted the defendant’s valuation of his UK property portfolio of £713,842.”
The appellant told us that he only queried the value of the properties six months after the order.  This occurred when  he instructed another firm of solicitors to investigate the position and they found there were only 4 properties left with no equity in any of them.  He knew that the remaining properties could not even be worth the figure of around £320,000 which the financial investigator had put on them on his statement of February 2019.  He said this:-
“I made it clear that I did not know what was left [of the property portfolio], we would have to caveat with a reservation that we did not know what properties remained.  I did not agree to a figure [which I knew to be without substance] to avoid a hidden assets finding.”
The appellant’s evidence was that he wanted to get the POCA proceedings settled, in particular because they imperilled his safety in prison.  “Nefarious characters” who were aware of his alleged wealth put him under pressure and sought to extort money from him by threats to his family.  He did not suggest that he saw any other benefit to him in the settlement than this.  The subject of “hidden assets” was never discussed with his lawyers, and both Mr. Haslam and Mr. Hammond agree that this is so.
In relation to the debt owed to Nudge Limited, he said that this was collectible except that Nudge Limited could not collect it because it had been struck off for failing to file its annual return.  The managing agent had resigned.  He said that Nudge Limited was owned by Trilindist Limited in which he had an interest.  He said he had never owned Nudge Limited.  His written statement said it was owned by David Gill.  This was not confirmed by the latest profile for Nudge Limited dated 9 February 2019 from Companies House Gibraltar which showed the appellant as the sole shareholder.  Trilindist, he accepted, was used to launder the proceeds of the fraud.  A document attached to an email from Mr. Hammond to the prosecution dated 2 March 2021 says this:-
“Shares Held by Trilindist (UAE) Ltd £1 ,020,050 GBP @ Cost in Nudge Ltd (GIB) Jason Butler's Share of Trilindist £306,015 GBP Ltd(30%) ”
This valuation of the appellant’s interest in the debt owed to Nudge Limited appeared on a schedule of his assets supplied by Mr. Hammond to the prosecution along with the £713,842 figure for the property portfolio in March 2021.  The appellant agreed that he had seen this schedule and discussed it with his lawyers in a conference on 16 March 2021, before it was sent to the prosecution on 22 March 2021.
The effect of his evidence was that, actually, at the date of the substantive hearing he had no assets at all, save for those which produced the payments in 2021 and 2022 of £104, 725.24.
He gave evidence, which we accept, that he has found being in prison for such a long time very difficult and distressing.  He also said that he has not had access to any assets from which he could satisfy the order and that his release date is March 2026.
Mr. Hammond said that he thought that the appellant agreed to the order for reasons of pragmatism.  He would be able to move to open conditions within the prison estate once the confiscation proceedings were resolved.  He said that he was not sure how the figure of £713,842 had been calculated.  He confirmed that he had been told that Mr. Butler had provided £950,000 to Nudge Limited.  This means that Nudge Limited received proceeds of the fraud and lent them to Brand Apps Limited which generated a debt in favour of Nudge Limited which became irrecoverable on that company being struck off the register.
Both lawyers confirmed that there was never any discussion of hidden assets with the appellant.
Discussion and decision
Mr. Bott KC says that a grave injustice has been committed because the appellant is serving a default term of imprisonment for failing to pay an order when there never were any assets from which it could be satisfied.  He says that we can be satisfied that the appellant does not have any assets to pay the order because otherwise he would do so and secure his release from prison.  The witness statement of the appellant is clear that prison is a great hardship for him.
That is not an argument which carries any weight.  The appellant has been in prison since March 2018.  We calculate that the time he must serve of the default term is 50% of 2317 days, or a little over 38 months.  He has not much more than 12 months left to do.  Paying the order now would not only cost him a large sum of money, but would also cause him significant further problems.  The assets which were used to calculate the available amount have either been realised or have proved to have no realisable value.  If the appellant suddenly produced the sum necessary to pay the outstanding part of the confiscation order, this would suggest that he did indeed have hidden assets at the time it was made.   This would undermine  his evidence which was placed before the Crown Court in the confiscation proceedings which might lead to further criminal proceedings.  Moreover, although prison is a serious punishment and never to be taken lightly, a further 12 months or so in order to retain a seven figure sum seems, at least financially, an attractive prospect.  None of this amounts to a finding that he does have such assets.  It is only an explanation of our rejection of the point made on his behalf that we should find positively that he does not.
Hirani has been followed, approved and applied on many occasions.  It is clearly binding on us.  It is not a statute and the test of “the most exceptional circumstances” should not be read as if it were.  The approach has been considered and refined in other cases, such as Ayankoya [2011] EWCA Crim 1488 and Ghulam [2018] EWCA Crim 1691.  In Ayankoya the court described the circumstances as exceptional and allowed the appellant to resile from a confiscation order to which he had agreed.  In some respects the circumstances were similar to those of the present case.  In Ghulam the court said that an appellant who alleged that he had agreed to a confiscation order relying on bad advice would have to show that he would have done better if he had been competently represented.  This tends to suggest that the question is not whether the circumstances were exceptional in that they are quite unlike anything that has happened before, but rather whether they are exceptional in that the order can be shown to have been procured by incompetent advice.  The further analysis by this court in R v. Miller [2022] EWCA Crim 1589, in particular at [81]-[83], emphasises that although it will always be a wholly exceptional case where an appeal against a confiscation order made by consent is allowed, the court’s focus is on fairness and justice.
The appellant’s case is that he did not know, and could not have known, that Nudge Limited had been struck off the register of companies a few weeks before the order was made.  In relation to the valuation of the property portfolio he says that he was not able to check the figures himself because he did not have access to the material in prison and was not present at the hearing.  In his written evidence he says:-
I was not present at any of the hearings and therefore did not have the opportunity to check the document or figures. I genuinely believe that had I been in attendance I would have recognised this error. I am particularly familiar with the details of my case and I believe that I would have noticed the equity figure stated was too high. I also believe that the financial investigator should have noticed this figure was too high particularly given that it was twice the value stated within our forensic report and indeed their own section 16 documents. In my opinion it is not reasonable to review and include a figure that is double that as previously presented without raising a query.”
But he told us that a short document which shows the value of the property portfolio as £713,842 was discussed with him at a conference with his lawyers on 16 March 2021.  It is quite apparent that as long ago as 2018 he was aware that the portfolio was much reduced (he suggested it was 17 properties by then) and that the value of those properties was very questionable because of the appointment of receivers by the mortgagees.  That is clear from his section 18(2) Response quoted at [8] above.  This is one of the documents we asked to be supplied to us after the hearing, because it is referred to in a footnote to Beverley Ibbotson’s Report.  The appellant is a resourceful businessman who built up this property portfolio, and he clearly knew that it was worth little or nothing as at April 2021.  He certainly knew that the figure of £713,842 which was put forward on his behalf as being its value at that time bore no relation to the truth.
His evidence about the debt owed to Nudge Limited which was available to him to the tune of £306,015, see [44] above, is also unacceptable.  He has no explanation for the entry at Companies House showing him as the sole shareholder of Nudge Limited.  The sudden disappearance of that company apparently means that the funds laundered through it are now irrecoverable, which has the appearance of highly successful money laundering.
In March or April 2021 the appellant faced the task of proving that the available amount was less than the benefit.  This involved explaining what had happened to £5,915,191.77, the negotiated figure, or over £9,000,000 on the prosecution case.  Although he had served a section 18(2) response in 2018, and a forensic accountant’s report in 2020, he never disclosed any witness statement from himself.  We have not seen any proof of evidence or any other indication as to how he was going to attempt the task of explaining where all the money had gone and why none of it was still available.  On the other hand, there was abundant evidence of a sophisticated network of offshore companies with multiple bank accounts through which money moved.  If all he wished to do was to dissipate the money, why would any of that be necessary?
Of course, we accept from the lawyers that the phrase “hidden assets” was not used, but the reality of the appellant’s position in the litigation must have been discussed.  As a convicted fraudster and an apparently accomplished money launderer, he was likely to fail to prove that the available amount was less than the benefit.  This would mean the confiscation order would be made in a very much higher sum, with a significantly higher default term of imprisonment.
Therefore, in late 2020 and early 2021 he set about a strategy of offering to consent to a much lower order based on assets on which he placed a particular value in those negotiations.  That value was unsustainable on examination as he knew.  The properties were worth nothing, and the debt owed to Nudge Limited has never been convincingly explained.  A number of documents concerning that transaction emanate from the appellant, and he has not been able to explain them either to us or, more significantly, in any document served or to be relied upon in the Crown Court in April 2021.  The attempt to show that the available amount at that date was £713,842 plus £306,015 and the sums paid in 2021, 2022 of £104, 725.24 would have collapsed if properly examined at a hearing in the Crown Court.  The result of that would have been an order in the amount of the benefit.  He had every reason to consent to this order and this is why he appeared to his lawyers to be pleased with the outcome.
For these reasons we do not accept that it is unfair or unjust to hold the appellant to the order which he instructed his lawyers actively to seek.  The appeal is dismissed.
Postscript
On 31 December 2024 Mr. Newbold sent an email to the Court of Appeal Office in which he said:-
“The position appears to be that:-
A total of £104,725.24 was paid towards the order in a series of payments in 2021 and 2022 (prior to committal in default). Those payments were taken into account when the Magistrates' Court calculated the relevant part of the default term which the Appellant was ordered to serve in November 2022.
On or around 27 December 2024, a further payment in the sum of £369,584.13 was made towards the confiscation order. That payment was, in light of the part of the default term which the Appellant has already served, sufficient to require his release from custody.
It appears that confirmation of payment was received too late on 27 December for the relevant regional confiscation unit in HMCTS and/or HMP Humber to give effect to it (and that there were various emails between the HMCTS confiscation unit and the Appellant's solicitors in relation to this). The Offender Management Unit at HMP Humber confirmed yesterday that the Appellant would be released yesterday afternoon, however.
In light of this, the Respondent anticipates that the Appellant will now have been released from custody.”
We asked the Court of Appeal Office to communicate with the HMCTS Confiscation Unit for confirmation of what we were told, and on the 3 January 2025 received this information in an email:-
“You are correct in stating that Mr Butler was released from custody on 2024-December-30. This was following a payment of £369,584.13 on 2024-December-27; this payment information was transmitted to the offender management unit at HMP Humber and they deemed that this payment was enough to secure Mr Butler’s immediate release.
Mr Butler still has a very large balance outstanding which will be enforced accordingly –
As we recited at the start of the judgment, the appellant’s solicitors were informed of the failure of the appeal on Christmas Eve.  The payment of £369,584.13 would appear to have been made on the next working day.  This judgment was drafted in advance of receipt of that news which is irrelevant to what we have to decide.  Paragraph [50] gives an account of some problems which might arise if an order is suddenly satisfied by a person who has repeatedly denied having any assets.  Whether any such difficulties may arise in this case is not for us to say.

Introduction
By an application dated 16 October 2024 (“the Application”), the Applicant, Enfield Highway Development Ltd (“Enfield”), applies to restrain the Respondent, Park Estate Holdings Limited (“Park Estate”) from presenting a winding up petition against it.
Park Estate, a company incorporated in Hong Kong, threatens to present a winding up petition against Enfield, based upon a debt of £54,180 alleged to be due as commission in respect the introduction of a purchaser for the sale of a property formerly known as Plot 1, Enfield Mews, and now known as 97b Albion, Ordinance Road, Enfield (“the Property”). It is Enfield’s case that the debt is disputed in good faith and on substantial grounds and/or that it is subject to a cross-claim or counterclaim that exceeds the debt, and, therefore, that Park Estate is not entitled to present a winding up petition and ought to be restrained by injunction from doing so. Park Estate responds that there is no substance to the dispute that is sought to be raised and no substance in any cross-claim or counterclaim, and thus that the Application ought to be dismissed.
The Application is supported by the witness statements of Enfield’s director, Mohammed Faraz (“Mr Faraz”) dated 5 October 2024 (“Faraz 1”) and 4 December 2024 (“Faraz 2”). The Application is responded to on behalf of Park Estate by the witness statement of its director, Derek Smith, dated 14 November 2024 (“Smith”).
At the hearing before me on 12 December 2024, Enfield was represented by Thomas Ames of Counsel, and Park Estate by Thomas West, Solicitor Advocate. I am grateful to them both for their written and oral submissions.
For the reasons set out below, I have concluded that the Application should be dismissed.
Correct approach to a disputed debt
There is a helpful summary of principles to be applied, where a company against whom winding up proceedings are threatened maintains that the relevant debt is disputed in good faith and on substantial grounds, in the judgment of Norris J in Angel Group v British Gas Trading Ltd [2012] EWHC 2702 (Ch), [2013] B.C.C 265, at [22], where Norris J said as follows:
“The principles to be applied in the exercise of this jurisdiction are familiar and may be summarised as follows:
A creditor's petition can only be presented by a creditor, and until a prospective petitioner is established as a creditor, he is not entitled to present the petition and has no standing in the Companies Court: Mann v Goldstein [1968] 1 W.L.R. 1091;
The company may challenge the petitioner's standing as a creditor by advancing in good faith a substantial dispute as to the entirety of the petition debt (or at least so much as will bring the indisputable part below £750);
A dispute will not be ""substantial"" if it has really no rational prospect of success: in Re A Company No.0012209 [1992] 1WLR 351 at 354B;
A dispute will not be put forward in good faith if the company is merely seeking to take for itself credit which it is not allowed under the contract: ibid. at 354F;
There is thus no rule of practice that the petition will be struck out merely because the company alleges that the debt is disputed. The true rule is that it is not the practice of the Companies Court to allow a winding up petition to be used for the purpose of deciding a substantial dispute raised on bona fide grounds, because the effect of presenting a winding up petition and advertising that petition is to put upon the company a pressure to pay (rather than to litigate) which is quite different in nature from the effect of an ordinary action: in Re A Company No.006685 [1997] BCC 830 at 832F;
But the court will not allow this rule of practice itself to work injustice and will be alert to the risk that an unwilling debtor is raising a cloud of objections on affidavit in order to claim that a dispute exists which cannot be determined without cross-examination (ibid. at 841C);
The court will therefore be prepared to consider the evidence in detail even if, in performing that task, the court may be engaged in much the same exercise as would be required of a court facing an application for summary judgment: (ibid at 837B).”
It is clear from other cases that the threshold for demonstrating that the debt is disputed on substantial grounds is not a particularly high one: see, for example, Tallington Lakes Ltd v South Kesteven District Council [2012] EWCA Civ 430 at [22], per Etherton J.  It follows from this that if, having considered the evidence in detail, and having concluded that there is a bona fide defence, albeit one that might only be regarded as shadowy in an application for summary judgment, an injunction to restrain the presentation of a petition may be justified. Nevertheless, in an appropriate case, the Court may be required to consider the evidence in detail, and be alert to the fact that the applicant company may simply be raising, in its evidence, a cloud of objections which lack credibility and/or have no substance, such that the dispute sought to be raised has no real or rational prospect of success - see Angel Group v British Gas Trading Ltd (supra) at [22(c), (f) and (g)].
Background
Enfield is a property development company that, in October 2021, engaged Park Estate, an Estate Agent based in Hong Kong, to market for sale 6 plots or units that it had developed on the site of the former Enfield Working Men’s Club, Ordinance Road, Enfield, which included the Property.
The contractual relationship between the parties was governed by the terms of a Sales Agency Agreement dated 21 October 2021 and made between Enfield (1) and Park Estate (2), referred to respectively therein as “the Principal” and “the Agent” (“the Agreement”).
Clause 6 of the Agreement, headed “COMMISSION”, provided as follows:
The Principal shall (subject to the Agent performing its obligations under this agreement) pay to the Agent the Commission Payment on each Unit and Parking, as may apply, for which the Agent introduces a Buyer to the Principal during the Agency Period, and where the Principal legally completes a sale contract in respect of a Unit and Parking, as may apply, in respect of such introduced Buyer.
The Agent shall become entitled to Commission Payment where a Buyer of a Unit and Parking, as may apply, introduced by the Agent during the Agency Period proceeds to an exchange of contracts and legal completion and such Commission Payment shall be payable in accordance for the provisions of this clause 6.3.”
Due date for payment of the commission
The Commission Payment shall be paid as follows:
on account of the Commission Payment or a Unit and/or Parking the Initial Payment shall be payable 5 working days following exchange of contracts of a Unit and Parking and receipt by the Seller’s Solicitor of the Initial Deposit from the Buyer of that Unit;
on account of the Commission Payment for a Unit and/or Parking the Initial Payment shall be payable 5 working days following exchange of contracts of a Unit and Parking and receipt by the Seller’s solicitor of the Further Deposit from the Buyer of that Unit;
the Final Payment balance of the Commission Payment shall be paid on the later of;
5 working days after legal completion of the contract for the sale of the Unit and Parking, as may be, to the respective buyer.
AND for the avoidance of doubt in the event of a Unit and parking, as may be, not legally completing no further sum over and above (a) and (where relevant) (b) shall be payable to the Agent.
No Commission Payments shall be due for any Unit and/or Parking which remains unsold at the expiry of the Agency Period.”
Clause 1 of the Agreement included the following relevant definitions:
“Agency Period” – “the period commencing on 01 October 2021 and expiring midnight (UK time) on 01 January 2022”.
“Buyer” - “third-party purchaser of a Unit and Parking during the Agency Period …”
“Commission Payment” - “the sum calculated in accordance with the following formula”, reference then being made to a formula which provided for a Commission Payment (“A”) as being the “Price for the unit and Parking, as may apply” (“B”), less “the strike price for the Unit and Parking, as may apply, as set out in Schedule 2” (“C”), i.e. A = B - C.
“Final Payment” - “the balance of Commission Payment due to the Agent upon legal completion of a sale of a Unit and Parking, as may apply, to a Buyer effected by the Agent.”
“Further Deposit” - “a second deposit (over and above the Initial Deposit) of 10% of the price payable by a Buyer of a Unit and Parking, as may apply, and will be noted as a Construction Payment, as the Agent may negotiate with a Buyer.”
“Further Payment” - “40% of the Further Deposit.”
“Initial Deposit” - “a deposit of 10% of the price payable by a Buyer of a Unit and Parking, as may apply.”
“Initial Payment” - “40% of the Initial Deposit.”
“Schedule 2” - the schedule of Strike Prices that apply from the commencement Date to and including 01 January 2022.”
“Units” - “the mix of six (6) Units as set out within Schedule 2”.
Schedule 2, described as “Price List”, comprised a table of 6 Units, including the Property as Unit 1, describing the Units as mews houses, and providing details in relation thereto, including the “Strike Price”, which was referred to as being £636,000 in the case of the Property/Unit 1.
The Agreement also contains the following provisions of potential relevance for present purposes, namely:
Clause 3.2.1 provided for Park Estate:
“To comply with all reasonable and lawful instructions of the Principal from time to time concerning the marketing and sale of the Units, and generally to carry out his agency in such manner as it thinks best to promote the interests of the Principal.”
Clause 4.8 provided that Park Estate should “provide sales and marketing consultancy advice and introduce Buyers to Units and Parking to the Principal; either directly through their own office, or through sub- agents, associates, third-party contacts and international connections, and, pursuant to clause 4.8.32:
“Actively monitor and manage sales from the point of view of a reservation through to exchange and completion, including working in conjunction with the Principal’s solicitors and the Principal’s in-house team.”
Clause 11.4 contained an entire agreement provision that provided that the Agreement … “Constitutes the entire agreement between the parties and supersedes and extinguishes all previous agreements, promises, assurances, warranties, representations and understandings between them, whether written or oral, relating to its subject matter.”
It is common ground between the parties that Park Estate did introduce a buyer for the Property to Enfield, that a sale was agreed in principle in July 2022, that contracts were exchanged on 5 December 2022, and that the sale of the Property completed on 19 January 2024 at a price of £716,300. It is further common ground between the parties that, in February 2023, Enfield made a payment to Park Estate of £26,120.
However, it is Enfield’s case that nothing further is due over and above this payment, and that what was paid in February 2023 was all that was due to Park Estate. On the other hand, It is Park Estate’s case that a balance of £54,180 is due, representing the net price paid (£716,300) less the relevant Strike Price (£636,000), namely £80,300 less the £26,120 already paid. Further, it is Park Estate’s case that the relevant Buyer who ultimately purchased the Property was introduced by Park Estate in November 2021, i.e. within the Agency Period (see Smith, paragraph 13).
Dispute sought to be raised by Enfield
In the course of submissions, Mr Ames, on behalf of Enfield, advanced three lines of argument in support of Enfield’s contention that Park Estate’s debt is disputed in good faith and on substantial grounds, namely:
Firstly, an argument that the commission payable to Park Estates is not payable as contended for by Part Estate as the difference between the net sale price and a Strike Price as provided for by the Agreement, it being Enfield’s case that the sale in question fell outside the “Agency Period” provided for by the Agreement, and was covered by a separate arrangement distinct from the Agreement, the terms of which are said to have been set out in a message dated 30 June 2022, under which the relevant commission payable has already been paid in full (“the Agency Period Issue”);
Secondly it is disputed that the “Strike Prices” provided for by the Agreement were, in any event, in fact agreed, it being contended that there was a separate agreement and/or that Mr Faraz was assured that Strike Prices would be agreed as and when sales were going to happen (“the Strike Prices Issue”);
Thirdly, it is contended that Park Estate acted in breach of clauses 3.2.1 and 4.8.3 of the Agreement, with the consequence that, as provided for by clause 6.1 of the Agreement, as Park Estate had not performed its obligations under the Agreement, and/or on the basis that Enfield has a cross-claim or counterclaim that exceeds the amount claimed by Park Estate, it is not open to Park Estate to present a winding up petition as a creditor (“the Cross Claim Issue”).
It is necessary to set out these contentions in rather more detail, and to consider the sequence in which they have been advanced.
As to the Agency Period Issue, at paragraphs 62-63 of Faraz 1, it was contended that as the Property remained unsold at the end of the Agency Period on 1 January 2022 (contracts not having been exchanged at that time, and not until July 2022, and the sale not having completed at that time, and until January 2024), the effect of clause 6.4 of the Agreement was that no commission payments were due.
Further, in paragraph 22 et seq. of Faraz 1, reference was made to Park Estate having sent an invoice dated 12 December 2022 referring to commission due of £65,300, and to their having been an exchange of correspondence thereafter with Tim Reinardy (“Mr Reinardy”) on behalf of Park Estate in which Mr Faraz, in an email dated 8 February 2023, offered that Enfield would pay 40% of the commission claimed in settlement of a dispute that existed in relation thereto at the time. He then referred to an email in reply from Mr Reinardy dated 9 February 2023 (10:22 GMT), which Mr Faraz relied upon as demonstrating an agreement on the part of Park Estate to accept 40% of the sale commission by way of compromise. Mr Faraz then said that on 17 February 2023, Enfield paid the £21,120 which, when added to a sum of £5,000 already held, amounted to a total of £26,120 which, according to Faraz 1, represented the total sum paid by Enfield in compromise of Park Estate’s claim to commission.
However, the case as put forward at the hearing and in Faraz 2 is rather different. Reliance is now placed upon a text message or WhatsApp message dated 30 June 2022 which is said to have been forwarded on behalf of Park Estate to Mr Faraz in which there is reference to an offer of £717,600 for “plot 2 Enfield Mews”, and wherein reference is made to “Agency fee: 3% plus bonus £5,000”. The case now sought to be advanced by reference to this message is that it was only at this time that the purchaser for the Property was introduced, i.e. well outside the Agency Period, which ended on 1 January 2022, and that the message reflects some new arrangement so far as the payment of commission or agency fee is concerned, in the terms set out therein, namely 3% of £717,600, plus a bonus of £5,000, which amounts to £26,510.
It was Enfield’s case, as advanced at the hearing, that the correspondence in February 2023 leading to the payment of the £21,120, related to the agency fee or commission agreed in June 2022, and that the reference to 40% was only used by Mr Faraz because Mr Reinardy had mentioned 40% at that time – see Faraz 2 at paragraph 29.
Thus, in short, it is Enfield’s case that pursuant to what was agreed in June 2022 and/or February 2023 as between Enfield and Park Estate (acting by Mr Reinardy), Enfield has paid all that is due to be paid to Park Estate, and that it is not open to Park Estate to rely upon the Agreement because the relevant Buyer was only introduced after the Agency Period provided for by the Agreement had come to an end.
As to Enfield’s second line of argument, namely that the Strike Price Issue, and the argument that Strike Prices were never agreed, Enfield’s case has again somewhat shifted.
In paragraph 11 of Faraz 1, it was alleged that there was no agreement regarding Strike Prices, or a minimum price at which Park Estate might sell, and that Mr Faraz did not see Schedule 2 until after he had signed the Agreement as it was not part of the Agreement that he “initially signed”. In paragraph 19 of Faraz 2, Mr Faraz went on to allege that he never signed any document which contained Strike Prices, and that the Agreement that he signed did not contain the same. However, in the course of submissions at the hearing, it was explained that Mr Faraz now accepted that he may have signed a copy of the Agreement containing Schedule 2 and the table therein described above, including Strike Prices, but he now says that whilst the Agreement that he signed may have included a Schedule 2 including Strike Prices, at the time that he signed the Agreement, he was assured by Mr Reinardy that once sales were going to happen, then the Stike Prices and Commission would be discussed at that point. As understood, it is Enfield’s case as there was never any subsequent discussion with regard to Strike Prices, and so Enfield never became bound to pay commission at the rate provided for by the Agreement.
As to the Cross Claim Issue, and the argument that Park Estate failed to perform its obligations under the Agreement, this is most fully dealt with in paragraph 33 et seq. of Faraz 2, where it is alleged that Park Estate failed to manage the process with the relevant Buyer in the manner provided for by the Agreement, and that this led to the significant delays that resulted in the sale not being completed until January 2024. It is alleged that the delay caused Enfield “considerable expense”, most significantly because, so it is alleged, Enfield was unable to renew its loan borrowings on much more favourable terms. The effect of this is said to be that Enfield continued to have to pay interest at a default rate of 2.75% per month from October 2022 onwards. Mr Faraz asserts that if matters had completed when they should have done if Park Estate/Mr Reinardy had properly managed the process, then the transaction would have completed some 11 months earlier, resulting in a saving of interest of about £69,000, i.e. considerably more than the balance of the commission now being sought by Park Estate. There is thus, it is said, a cross-claim or counterclaim in at least this amount.
Has Enfield raised a substantial dispute as to the debt?
I consider each of the lines of argument advanced by Enfield in turn.
Agency Period issue
As I have identified, the case as advanced at the hearing was that commission became payable not as provided for the Agreement, but as provided for by the message dated 30 June 2022 referring to an agency fee of 3% plus bonus £5,000, that the exchange of correspondence in February 2023 related thereto, and that all that was due to be paid has been paid pursuant thereto, namely the £21,120 paid on 17 February 2023 and the £5,000 already held by Park Estate.
I consider that, in order to consider whether there is any credibility in or substance to this argument, it is necessary to consider with some care the full run of the correspondence of which the correspondence relied upon by Mr Faraz, namely his email of 8 February 2023 and Mr Reinardy’s response of 9 February 2023, formed part.
The email correspondence in February 2023 ran as follows, including some internal emails between representatives of Park Estates and its associates, including Regency Property:
The email dated 8 February 2023 from Mr Faraz to Mr Reinardy read as follows:
“Hi,
Further to our conversation as explained and noted Andrew has left the company, who was the contact in relation to our last agreement. Please note contract dated from Oct21 to jan22. As you (sic) well aware my understanding and appointment was purely through yourself, nevertheless throughout this period are working is based on trust.
Having said this and as per our conversation we agreed to pay 40% of your commission which will be funded personally as the deposit from the buyers was held till completion and the rest should be released on completion.”
At 18:42 on 8 February 2023, Mr Reinardy internally emailed Derek Smith of Park Estate in the following terms:
“Hi Derek,
Please see Faraz email below, after having spoken to him again this morning.
He is on the verge of terminating the deal and handing back the buyers exchange monies, he will honour what he believed to be the terms of sale at 40% of commission and balance on completion only if legal proceedings are ceased.
His advice from his solicitor is that our contract is null and void and that he would win any case based on this alone but Faraz has no appetite for this and wants resolution asap.
I believe he will terminate the sale if we cannot come to agreement on the above. Please let me know if and how you would like me to respond?”
By an email sent at 02:32 on 9 February 2023, Derek Smith of Park Estate responded to Mr Reinardy as follows:
“I have spoken to [Mike Smith] this morning.
We are prepared to accept 40% of the sale commissions as per the calculation below.
Enfield #1
Sale 716,300
Strike 651,000
Differential/comm 65,300
40% of 65,300 = 26,120
Our legal fee for this has been 850 we also expect to be reimbursed that amount.
If this is acceptable to  Faraz, we would like to be paid immediately and have confirmation from his lawyers that he will honour the final commission of Gbp 39,180.00 within 5 working days from completion of the unit.
Please confirm with me as soon as he has agreed to this.”
I would note that the reference to a Strike of £651,000 would appear to be a reference to the Strike Price of £636,000 referred to in Schedule 2 to the Agreement plus £15,000 in respect of “Car park”, as referred to in an invoice from Park Estate to Enfield dated 12 December 2022 that has been exhibited by Mr Faraz.
It is in this context that Mr Reinardy sent his email dated 9 February 2023 (10:22) that is relied upon by Mr Faraz, that said as follows:
“Park Estates are prepared to accept 40% of the sale commissions as per the calculations below.
97b Albion (Enfield Mews House #1) Ordinance Road, Enfield
Sale 716,300
Strike 651,000
Diff/comm 65,300
40% of 65,300 = 26,120
Our legal fee for this has been £850 which they also expect to be reimbursed that amount.
Please can you confirm once the above has been transferred to the following account : [details of a Hong Kong bank account were provided]”
On 9 February 2023 at 23:24, Mr Reinardy emailed Derek Smith as follows:
“Faraz wants confirmation from you, that the legal proceedings will be ceased as soon as agreed fees have been received before transferring funds.”
On 10 February 2023 at 02:05, Derek Smith responded to Mr Reinardy as follows:
“Sorry I did not read that correctly.
Faraz has said he will only pay us if he gets the money released by the buyer. This is not what I have agreed to and is not acceptable to us.
Unless we have 40% of the commission fee in our account by Wednesday, 15 February Mike has instructed me to proceed with a bankruptcy petition and to instruct a lien on the development.
If Faraz continues to move the posts we will instruct lawyers to get on with it without further notice.”
At 20:14 (this may be Hong Kong time) on 10 February 2023, Mr Reinardy responded to Derek Smith as follows:
“Faraz says he will transfer monies to land in account for Thursday 16th, but does not want to transfer to HK account, he will do it to UK account, is that okay to run through Regent account and forward on? Also he needs revised invoice showing agreed 40% of commission minus 5K reservation deposit. This will come direct from him not buyers exchange monies.”
On 10 February 2023 at 15:24, Mr Reinardy emailed Mr Faraz as follows:
“Please can you transfer 40% sales commission of 21,122 the following account: [details of UK bank account were provided].
Please also confirm by return that balance of 60% commission monies due totalling 39,180 will be paid on completion of the transaction.
Legal proceedings will be stopped upon confirmation of received first stage commission no later than Thursday, 16 February 2023 and confirmation of balance to be paid on completion.”
On 15 February 2023 at 22:17, Mr Faraz emailed Mr Reinardy in the following terms:
Hi,
As discussed earlier I am still waiting for your reply confirming where buyers failed to proceed to completion and has find (sic) any legal reason to abort the purchase of the said property your company undertake to return the 40% of the commission amount they received from my personal account.”
At 08:23 (Hong Kong time) on 16 February 2023, Mr Reinardy emailed Mike Smith in relation to the email that he had received from Mr Faraz saying that:
“Faraz wants assurances on below before do the transfer tomorrow as per below.”
This led to Mr Reinardy emailing Mr Faraz on 16 February 2023 at 07:23 stating that:
As per your request, Park Estates (New London Ltd) undertake to repay the commission paid on #1 enfield if the buyer fails to complete and the purchaser is repaid his deposit in full.”
It was following these exchanges that Mr Faraz caused the sum of £21,120 to be paid to Regent Property, to be forwarded to Park Estate, on 17 February 2023.
It is against this background that I consider whether Enfield advances a realistic case that the message dated 30 June 2022 provides credible evidence of some new arrangement concerning an introduction made by Park Estate after the end of the Agency Period providing for an agency fee of 3% plus £5,000 bonus to be paid as specified therein, and that it is this arrangement to which the correspondence in February 2023 that Mr Faraz relies upon relates, and pursuant to which the payment of £26,120 was made in February 2023.
I do not consider that Enfield does advance a remotely credible case as to the commission or agency fee payable consequential upon the introduction of a buyer for the Property being governed by some new arrangement based upon the message dated 30 June 2022 for, essentially, the following reasons:
The message dated 30 June 2022 refers to “plot 2”, and not Unit 1 or Plot 1, i.e. not, prima facie, the Property. It also refers to a consideration of £717,800 rather than the £716,300 obtained for the Property, albeit that it would appear to refer to the same purchaser by name.
In his email dated 8 February 2023, Mr Faraz asked Mr Reinardy to note “contract dated from Oct21 to jan22”. This is, as I see it, significant for two reasons. Firstly, if Mr Faraz had believed that the Agreement had no application, and that the sale of the Property was governed by some new agreement reflected in the message dated 30 June 2022, then one would have expected him to have mentioned this rather than specifically identifying dates that tie in with the Agency Period under the Agreement. Secondly, if the introduction had been after January 2022, i.e. outside the Agency Period, then one would have expected Mr Faraz to have mentioned this in the February 2023 correspondence.
To the contrary, as I read it, the February 2023 correspondence proceeded on the basis that the relevant introduction had been during the Agency Period, and that the terms of the Agreement related to it, hence the reference in this correspondence to Strike Prices, and 40% of the deposit paid being payable to Park Estate. I note in particular the contents of Mr Reinardy’s emails to Mr Faraz dated 9 February 2023 (10:22) and 10 February 2023 (15:24).
In paragraph 29 of Faraz 2, Mr Faraz said that he use the term 40% commission in correspondence simply because it was referred to as terminology in the email from Mr Reinardy dated 9 February 2023. However, this is demonstrably incorrect because Mr Faraz , in his email sent the preceding day (8 February 2023) himself referred to 40% of the commission in the context of referring to a conversation in which Enfield had agreed to pay “40% of your commission which will be funded personally as the deposit from the buyers was held till completion and the rest would be released on completion.”
As to the last few words of this quote from the email dated 8 February 2023, in Faraz 1, at paragraph 28, Mr Faraz maintains that this reference to “the rest being released on completion” is “about the rest of the deposit being released to the Company, because the deposit was currently being held by the Respondent. It does not refer to the rest of the commission being paid.” However, this is inconsistent with the February 2023 correspondence taken as a whole, where the clear premise, as reflected in, for example, Mr Reinardy’s email dated 10 February 2023 (15:24), was that a balance would be paid to Park Estate on completion of the sale. Certainly, the correspondence in February 2023 is entirely inconsistent with Park Estate agreeing to accept either 40% of the commission or what may have been specified in the message dated 30 June 2022, as being the total amount that Enfield was obliged to pay so far as commission was concerned.
At Smith, paragraph 13, it is clearly asserted that, in November 2021, Park Estate introduced a purchaser for the Property. Nowhere in Faraz 2 is this specifically denied as such, the message dated 30 June 2022 being put forward to explain a later introduction. However, as referred to above, this message referred to “plot 2” and a different sale price, and does not otherwise provide a credible explanation as to what was agreed so far as commission payable for the introduction of the Property is concerned.
Further, so far as reliance on clause 6.4 of the Agreement is concerned, it is certainly the case that the Property remained “unsold” as at 1 January 2022 in the sense that no contract had been entered into, and there had been no completion. However, read together with clause 6.2, it is in my view clear that clause 6.4 is referring to introductions when it refers to “unsold”, and what is key is that there should be an introduction before 1 January 2022 that is subsequently completed.
In these circumstances, I do not consider that this particular line of argument based upon an argument that the relevant introduction post-dated the Agency Period and was governed by some arrangement distinct from the Agreement discloses a substantial dispute advanced in good faith in relation to the debt in respect of which Park Estate proposes to present a winding up petition.
There is, however, one caveat as to this. I consider that the evidence does, prima facie, disclose a substantial dispute as to whether the amount due is £54,180, or £39,180. The invoice dated 12 December 2022 referred to above identified the total commission due as being £65,300, based upon a sale price of £716,300, the deduction of a Strike Price of £636,000, but also deducting £15,000 for “Car park”. An invoice dated 22 January 2024 referred to the same figure of £65,300 being due by way of commission calculated in the same way. This latter invoice then gave credit for the £26,120 already paid, leaving a balance of £39,180. However, a revised invoice dated 22 January 2024 removes the reference to “Car park”, thus increasing the amount due to £54,180. I note that the agreement reached in the course of the February 2023 correspondence was reached on the basis of the figures in the invoice dated 12 December 2022, and that correspondence referred to a balance of £39,180. In the circumstances, and subject to hearing further argument on the point if required, it does seem to me that there is a substantial dispute as to whether Park Estate is entitled to the balance over and above £39,180. However, that still leaves a debt of well over £750 that might be the proper subject matter of a winding up petition, subject to Enfield’s further arguments.
Strike Price Issue
The dispute sought to be raised by Enfield in this second line of argument is that the Strike Price of £636,000 was never agreed, and so Park Estate is not entitled to the commission that it seeks.
However, again, I do not consider there to be any real substance to this alleged dispute, which I consider lacks any real credibility or substance for, essentially, the following reasons:
Mr Faraz’s change of story is not attractive or convincing. In Faraz 1 and Faraz 2, Mr Faraz boldly asserted that he did not sign any document that contained reference to the Strike Prices, which could only have been the case if the document that he signed did not include Schedule 2 thereto. However, at the hearing before me it was accepted that he had signed a copy of the Agreement which included Schedule 2, but it was asserted that Mr Reinardy had assured Mr Faraz that “once sales were going to happen”, then the Strike Prices and Commission would be discussed, i.e. that there was some form of representation by Mr Reinardy or collateral agreement in relation thereto. The other way that it had been put in paragraph 17 of Faraz 2 was that there was never any discussion with regard to Strike Prices, and that Mr Reinardy had adopted the stance that once he found a buyer he would then discuss actual prices with Mr Faraz, the point being made that by Mr Faraz that was unaware of the prices at which the relevant properties were being marketed in Hong Kong by Park Estate.
In Faraz 1, Mr Faraz maintained that his position was supported by contemporaneous emails, there being exhibited to Faraz 1 emails from Andrew Cameron to Mr Faraz dated 28 September 2021 and 18 October 2021, the latter email being copied into Mr Reinardy. However, the latter email referred to “complete agreements” being attached for Mr Faraz’s final approval, and it also contained an explanation that “the Strike Price is the total sum to you and are commission is the sale price less the Strike Price (the sum made on top of the Strike Price).” This, when taken together with the contents of Schedule 2 to the Agreement, is, as I see it, entirely inconsistent with any contemporaneous discussion or agreement of the kind contended for by Mr Faraz, and, in reality, excludes the possibility that Schedule 2 was not part of the Agreement when Mr Faraz signed it.
A discussion with regard to Strike Prices “once sales were going to happen” would, as I see it, make little commercial sense. Presumably, the mechanism for the payment of commission by reference to a difference between sale price and Strike Price was designed to incentivise Park Estate to achieve sales, but if agreement with regard to Strike Prices were to await a sale being “about to happen”, this would be liable to defeat the object of structuring the commission in this way.
The representations on the part of Mr Reinardy and/or collateral agreement that Enfield seeks to rely upon with regard to Strike Prices being subsequently agreed does not rest easily with the entire agreement provision in clause 11.4 of the Agreement.
If Strike Prices were yet to be agreed, then Mr Faraz would, as I see it, inevitably have raised the point in the course of the February 2023 correspondence. As Mr Reinardy’s email dated 9 February 2023 (10:22) relied upon by Mr Faraz himself makes clear, Mr Reinardy’s calculations were based upon a differential between sale price and Strike Price, a figure of 651,000 in respect of the Strike Price being consistent with the invoice dated 12 December 2022 which had included the £15,000 in respect of “Car park”. There is no contemporaneous evidence to suggest that Mr Faraz challenged this, and he does not suggest that he did. To the contrary, he positively relies upon the email dated 9 February 2023.
Park Estate’s revised invoice dated 22 January 2024 was first challenged by Enfield’s Solicitors in an email dated 19 March 2024. Significantly, this email did not maintain that no strike price been agreed. To the contrary, it maintained that the Strike Price should be £651,000, reliance being placed upon the inconsistency between the initial invoice dated 22 January 2024 and the revised invoice of the same date discussed in paragraph 34 above. Again, if the position were as Mr Faraz now maintains that it was, I consider it almost inevitable that it would have been raised in this correspondence.
In short, I do not consider that Enfield’s case that there was no agreement with regard to the Strike Price to be applied discloses a substantial dispute in respect of the debt upon which Park Estate proposes to base a winding up petition, save that it does serve to highlight the dispute regarding the £15,000 referred to in paragraph 34 above.
iii  Cross Claim Issue
As I have identified, the key argument is that Park Estate failed properly to engage with the purchaser that had been introduced, that this amounted to a breach of the terms of clauses 3.2.1 and 4.8.3 of the Agreement and caused loss to Enfield as a result of the delay occasioned thereby, the principal element of loss being interest at an additional default rate that Enfield continued to be required to pay as a result of being unable to refinance prior to the completion of the sale of the Property.
It is not in dispute that the existence of a cross-claim that exceeds the amount of the debt, and which is advanced in good faith and on substantial grounds, can provide the basis for restraining the presentation of a winding up petition – see Re Bayoil SA [1999] 1 WLR 147. However, I am not satisfied that the evidence discloses the existence of such a cross-claim or counterclaim.
There are, as I see it, the following difficulties with Enfield’s claim that Park Estates acted in breach of contract as alleged so as to give rise to a substantial cross-claim or counterclaim that exceeds the relevant debt:
I consider that the evidence advanced by Enfield in Faraz 1 and Faraz 2 fails to go significantly beyond bald assertion as to failures on the part of Park Estates to act as required by the Agreement. It is not, for example, alleged that Park Estates or its agents were requested to carry out any specified task in respect of the buyer, and failed to do so, at least so as to cause any particular period of delay referable to the particular breach. There is simply a generalised assertion that Park Estates was expected to have all relevant dealings with the buyer, and that it failed to do that which it ought to have done. Further, many of the dealings that Enfield appears to be suggesting that Park Estates or its agents ought to have been engaged in with the purchaser are tasks that one would ordinarily have expected to be dealt with by Solicitors in the ordinary course in any event.
In so far as Enfield appears to suggest that there was a total failure of consideration on the part of Park Estate, this cannot be correct. Park Estates clearly did carry out at least some valuable work so far as marketing the Property for sale is concerned, and identifying a buyer. As Mr West points out, in Stream Healthcare (London) Ltd v Pitman Education and Training Ltd [2010] EWHC 216 (Ch) at [73], Mann J held that the provision of a decor pack with a value of around £500 in the context of a claim worth over £100,000 was “a complete and short answer to the total failure of consideration point”.
No contemporaneous documentation has been produced that provides any cogent evidence of delay, or of contemporaneous complaints in relation to delay, caused by the conduct of Park Estates or its agents.
Mr Faraz’s own evidence, at paragraph 37 et seq of Faraz 2, identifies that a significant problem was caused by the buyer having initially instructed Axiom, Solicitors, a firm which suffered “significant professional problems”, that necessitated the buyer instructing new Solicitors to act. I understand that Axiom was the subject matter of an SRA intervention in 2023. This plainly caused a significant element of delay both in respect of the necessity for the buyer to find new Solicitors, and a loss of documentation.
Even if Park Estate did act in breach of the Agreement in some way, there is no real evidence to show that any delay that may have been caused by the actions of Park Estates was causative of any particular loss, in a particular loss in an amount exceeding the debt of £54,118 relied upon by Park Estate, or even the lesser amount of £39,180.
Thus, for example, Enfield’s evidence provides no evidence explaining Enfield’s lending arrangements with any particularly, and no contemporaneous documentary evidence is exhibited to support its case in relation thereto, and the alleged requirement to renew on favourable terms.
Whilst clause 6.1 of the Agreement provides that the obligation to pay commission is subject to Park Estates performing its obligations under the Agreement, I consider that, for this pre-condition to take effect, the onus must be upon Enfield to show that there has been a substantial breach of the Agreement that has caused it some significant loss. The evidence, in my judgment, falls well short of doing so in the present case.
Overall conclusion
On the basis of the above findings, and even having regard to the fact that the threshold for demonstrating that a debt is disputed on substantial grounds in this context is not a particularly high one, I consider that the evidence in support of the Application lacks credibility and substance, and fails to disclose any defence or cross-claim that has any realistic prospect of success so as to provide an answer to the debt that Park Estates proposes should form the basis of a winding up petition against Enfield, apart from in respect of the difference between the sum of £54,180 and the sum of £39,180 as referred to in paragraph 34 above.
In the circumstances, I consider that the Application should be dismissed.

JUDGMENT
[Judge]:  Mrs Justice Foster
INTRODUCTION
This is an appeal under section 40 of the Medical Act 1983 brought by Dr Wheatley against a Determination of a Medical Practitioners Tribunal (“the MPT”) dated 13 November 2023 after a hearing held between 30 May and 12 June 2023 and on 13 November 2023. The MPT found that on 9 November 2021  at a social event  at the Tri Services  Trainers  Conference, Dr Wheatley had engaged in inappropriate behaviour towards his colleague  referred to as Ms A.
The MPT decided that Dr Wheatley’s fitness to practice was impaired and imposed a six-week suspension upon him which is yet to come into effect.
Two Grounds of Appeal  are pursued which challenge the factual conclusions of the MPT. It is argued that those conclusions are:
outwith the findings of a  reasonable tribunal, and
Not supported by adequate reasoning
Dr Wheatley’s case is that the inconsistencies in and inadequacy of the evidence led by the GMC were such that the MPT could not properly have been sure on the balance of probabilities that he had behaved as was alleged. The presence of  inconsistencies and contradictions in the evidence both written and oral ought to have led to an acquittal. The unreasonableness of the MPT’s  conclusions is fortified  by the fact that the doctor was acquitted of one of allegations made against him on the basis that any touching of the complainant’s breast (earlier in the evening) had been accidental.  The appellant was drunk and unsteady, the case against him was inherently weak, he was, as he stated, steadying himself to balance, and any touching of Ms A  was accidental.   The reasoning processes by  which the MPT  found the allegation proved were faulty.
The Appellant referred the Court to the final submissions  on the evidence made on his behalf to the MPT.
FACTS
The Tri-Service Trainers Conference is an annual event. It is a three-day residential conference to support professional development in the Defence Deanery, that is the medical services within the  Armed Services. Serving military officers alongside civilian medical practitioners working for Defence are the target audience. On 9 November 2021 there was a  formal dinner organised by the Defence Deanery, with a drinks reception in an anteroom followed by dinner in the Sandhurst Officers’ Mess with a presentation and an address from the Dean, and an informal gathering thereafter. The appellant was attending in the capacity of a currently practising GP, and as an erstwhile Army Officer in the Royal Army Medical Corps  which he had left in October 2001 at the rank of Lt Colonel. Dr Wheatley is currently a partner in a large General Practice in Lincolnshire. He  obtained his medical qualifications at Nottingham University Medical School qualifying  MBBS in 1986. He became a member of the Royal College of General Practitioners in July 1993 and obtained an MSc in general practice in 2001. His final post was as Associate Medical Director to the Director of Army General Practice. He was one of the distinguished guests on top table at the dinner. The complainant, Ms A is a Civil Service Member of the Defence Medical Academy administrative staff.
On the evening of 9 November 2021 the sit-down dinner, the first real get-together since Covid lockdown, started at around 7 PM  and lasted around two hours after which people moved into the anteroom. All the people in the anteroom were GP trainers and were known to each other, there were a few administrative staff there also,  Ms A was one. She had done much of the work to organise the dinner.
The facts found proved  against Dr Wheatley by the MPT were that on 9 November 2021 he had engaged in inappropriate behaviour towards his colleague Ms A in that he  had “ put [his] arm around Ms A’s waist on one or more occasions” and “placed [his] hand on Ms A’s bottom on one or more occasions.” An allegation that he had persistently sought her attention despite requests on one or more occasions for him to stop,  was deleted and not pursued. A further allegation to the effect that he had touched Ms A’s breast  and the touching was sexual was found not proved.
In respect of  the two proven allegations above, it was also found proved that the conduct “was sexually motivated and that it amounted to sexual harassment pursuant to section 26 Equality Act in that [he]engaged in unwanted conduct of a sexual nature, which had the purpose or effect of violating the dignity of Ms A, or creating an intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating or offensive environment for her.”
No challenge is made independently to the finding of unfitness nor the suspension: the Grounds attack the substance of the findings of fact as stated.
LEGAL FRAMEWORK
The scope and character of this appeal is well established and not in dispute. A medical practitioner has an appeal as of right under section 40 the Medical Act  to this Court. The appeal is described as by way of rehearing,  but the extent to which an appellate court will defer to the judgement of the MPT is dictated by the circumstances. There have been various encapsulations in the caselaw of the manner in which a court of appeal will approach a challenge to findings of fact. The cases of Southall v General Medical Council [2010] EWCA Civ 407; 113 BMLR 178 and Gupta v General Medical Council [2001] UK PC 61; [2002] 1 WLR 1691 and many others, reflect that the  MPT are the primary finders of fact. In Gupta Lord Rodger giving the reasons of the Board said (at paragraph 10):
“[…] the appeal court readily acknowledges that the first instance body enjoys an advantage which the appeal court does not have, precisely  because that body is in a better position to judge the credibility and reliability of the evidence given by the witnesses. In some appeals that  advantage may not be significant since the witnesses’ credibility and  reliability are not in issue. But in many cases the advantage is very significant and the appeal court is slow to interfere with the decisions on matters of fact taken by the first  instance body.”
More recently in Byrne v General Medical Council [2021] EWHC 2237 (Admin) Morris J  gave a detailed and comprehensive overview of the jurisdiction under section 40. He said (reflecting the proposition above):
“ ..
On appeal, the question for the Court is whether the Tribunal was wrong, or unjust because of a serious procedural or other irregularity: see CPR 52.21(3). Further, an appeal under s.40 is a full appeal by way of re-hearing (and is thus, in principle, broader than the usual jurisdiction of “review” applicable to most appeals): see CPR 52.21(1)(a) and Practice Direction 52D, paragraph 19.”
He distilled the principles as to the correct approach on an appeal against a tribunal’s determination on the facts from  the numerous cases and I adopt  his analysis with gratitude. Between paragraphs 11 to 20  of Byrne he said this:
The approach of the Court on appeal to a finding of fact, and in particular a finding of  primary fact
The issue is as to the circumstances in which an appeal court will interfere with  findings of fact made by the court or decision maker below.   …
First, the degree of deference shown to the court below will differ depending on the  nature of the issue below; namely whether the issue is one of primary fact, of  secondary fact, or rather an evaluative judgment of many factors: Assicurazioni  Generali at §§16 to 20.  The present case concerns findings of primary fact: did the  events described by the Patient A happen?
Secondly, …[the] starting point is that the appeal court will be very slow to  interfere with findings of primary fact of the court below.  The reasons for this are  that the court below has had the advantage of having seen and heard the witnesses,  and more generally has total familiarity with the evidence in the case. A further  reason for this approach is the trial judge’s more general expertise in making  determinations of fact: see Gupta, and McGraddie v McGraddie at §§3 to 4. I accept  that the most recent Supreme Court cases interpreting Thomas v Thomas (namely  McGraddie and Henderson v Foxworth) are relevant.  Even though they were cases of “review” rather than “rehearing”, there is little distinction between the two types of  cases for present purposes ….
…
Fourthly, the circumstances in which the appeal court will interfere with primary findings of fact have been formulated in a number of different ways, as follows:-
where “any advantage enjoyed by the trial judge by reason of having seen and heard the witnesses could not be sufficient to explain or justify the trial  judge’s conclusions”: per Lord Thankerton in Thomas v Thomas approved in  Gupta;
- findings “sufficiently out of the tune with the evidence to indicate with  reasonable certainty that the evidence had been misread” per Lord Hailsham  in Libman;
- findings “plainly wrong or so out of tune with the evidence properly read as to  be unreasonable”: per in Casey at §6 and Warby J (as he then was) in Dutta   at §21(7);
…
Fifthly, I consider that, whilst noting the observations of Warby J in Dutta at §21(1),  on the balance of authority there is little or no relevant distinction to be drawn  between “review” and “rehearing”, when considering the degree of deference to be  shown to findings of primary fact: Assicurazioni §§13, 15 and 23.  Du Pont at §§94  and 98 is not clear authority to the contrary.  ”
The credibility of witnesses and corroborating evidence
…. Where possible, factual findings should be  based on objective facts as shown by contemporaneous documents: Dutta §§39 to 42  citing, in particular, Gestmin and Lachaux.
… in assessing the reliability and credibility of witnesses,  … I consider that, if relevant, demeanour might in  an appropriate case be a significant factor and the lower court is best placed to assess  demeanour:   … the balance  of authority supports this view: Gupta §18  and Southall at §59.
…  In a case where the evidence consists of conflicting oral accounts, the court may properly place  substantial reliance upon the oral evidence of the complainant (in preference to that of  the defendant/appellant): Chyc at §23.  There is no rule that corroboration of a patient  complainant’s evidence is required: see Muscat §83 and Mubarak §20.
Fourthly, in a case where the complainant provides an oral account, and there is a flat  denial from the other person concerned, and little or no independent evidence, it is  commonplace for there to be inconsistency and confusion in some of the detail.  Nevertheless the task of the court below is to consider whether the core allegations are  true: Mubarak at §20.”
As to the second part of the challenge, Southall (supra) is the leading authority on reasons in the current context, the obligation being to give reasons to enable the losing party to know why he had lost and allow him to consider whether to appeal. Reasons must be plain because either they are set out or because they can be readily inferred from the form and content of the decision. If they are not otherwise plain and obvious then they ought to be set out. In paragraph 55 of Southall it was said per Leveson LJ:
“in most cases particularly those concerned with comparatively simple conflicts of factual evidence, it will be obvious whose evidence has been rejected and why.”
although
“when… the case is not straightforward and can properly be described as exceptional, the position is and will be different.”
and
“… A few sentences dealing with the salient issues was essential [in the case of Southall]: this was an exceptional case, and I have no doubt, perceived to be so by the GMC, Dr Southall and the panel”
Morris J emphasised in Byrne, that Southall was not authority for the proposition that specific reasons for disbelieving the practitioner are required in every case when his defence is rejected. The case of Byrne also provides guidance on reasons concerning the credibility of witnesses.
“26 … (1) Where there is a dispute of fact involving a choice as to the credibility of competing accounts of two witnesses, the adequacy of reasons given will vary.
In English v Emery, Lord Phillips stated that “it may be enough to say that one witness was preferred to another, because the one manifestly had a clearer  recollection of the material facts or the other give answers which demonstrated that his recollection could not be relied upon”. On the other hand, Southall at §55, and Gupta at §13 and 14 suggest that even such limited  reasons are not necessarily required in every case.
… there is no requirement for the disciplinary body to make, at  the outset of its determination, a general comparative assessment of the credibility of the principal witnesses. Indeed such a practice, undertaken  without reference to the specific allegations, has been the subject of recent  criticism...
Finally, an appeal court will not allow an appeal on grounds of inadequacy of reasons, unless, even with the benefit of knowledge of the evidence and submissions made below, it is not possible for the appeal court to understand why the judge below had  reached the decision it did reach. It is appropriate for the appeal court to look at the  underlying material before the judge to seek to understand the judge's reasoning and  to ""identify reasons for the judge's conclusions which cogently justify"" the judge's decision, even if the judge did not himself clearly identify all those reasons: see English v Emery Reimbold §§89 and 118.”
These are the principles which I apply.
THE CASE BEFORE the MPT
The GMC relied on witness statements including from other attendees at the function including Dr Katrina Peebles, Dr Timothy Brodribb, Ms A, Dr Dudley Graham, and Dr Sabine Jefferies. Of them, Ms A, Dr Graham, Surgeon Commander Brodribb and Dr Peebles were called to give oral evidence at the fact finding stage. Other material detailed the internal review that had taken place, and correspondence nearer the time of the events in issue.
Not all of the allegations originally made proceeded at the hearing. The GMC agreed that the first, that Dr. Wheatley had persistently sought Ms A’s attention despite requests on one or more occasions to stop, could not be made out as she accepted  that her attempts to avoid him and escape his attentions  may well not have been realised by him. As to the allegation of touching her breast (numbered 1 (d)), she had explained in her own evidence how, in jovial conversation, his medals, and those of another decorated guest, had been transferred to her chest as a joke.  She said in her written statement that she understood he was looking to adjust the medals that had become unhooked, and although touching her breast without her agreement was inappropriate, she did not think it had been deliberate. The GMC  accepted (and the MPT decided) that  the allegation that the touching of the breast was sexually motivated in those circumstances did not survive a half-time submission,  so that there was no case answer on that allegation. The suggestion that it might amount to sexual harassment proceeded but in the event, the MPT did not find that allegation proved.
Ms A  had said in her statement how she had had unwanted attention from the Appellant and another doctor throughout the evening  at the event. There had been the incident when Dr Wheatley had touched her breast whilst adjusting medals, and she described the touching of her bottom. She had felt someone’s arm around her lower waist, then his hand went to her bottom. He had approached from behind her.  Her oral evidence was to broadly similar effect as her written statement. She said:
“He did not squeeze my bottom, and I don’t think he patted or caressed it or anything, but it was an extremely uncomfortable situation, and initially I was in  shock. I then remember saying to Graham something to the effect of ‘you have  your hand on my bum’. I think he took his hand off as soon as I said it.”
The MPT asked a number of questions which are revealing as to their concerns. There were agreed to be about 40 people present at the dinner, organised by Ms A, and the first since lockdown. Of that number only four, of whom Ms A was one, were administrative staff. There were a few others representing ethics and education, and a few trainees. The others were all GPs, whether military or civilian. They asked her about the avoidance mechanisms she had said she had used to avoid Dr Wheatley in the course of the evening,  and regarding an answer she had given in cross-examination. Dr Wheatley’s counsel, Mr McCartney, who did not appear before me, had asked her whether she had told Dr Wheatley to just go away. She said no, it was not always that simple. She was questioned by the panel Chair thus:
Q Just one question I have, a point in your evidence you were asked about devices you would use to stop Dr Wheatley – telling him to go  somewhere else in effect from your group, and you said you hadn’t told him to go away, it’s not always that simple.  Can you explain what that meant?   A. Nobody likes confrontation. Nobody likes to cause a scene, so as awkward  as it is, I just chose to use other methods.  The people that I was with and having conversations with, they knew how I was feeling, but I don’t think when  you’re in that situation, it’s very, very easy just to say, “Can you leave me alone,  please?”
Q. What other methods did you use? What devices were you using? A. Just sort of – just trying to distract him.”
As noted above, she had earlier explained in evidence that she had been affronted when he had leant over and adjusted the medals on her chest (which he had given her as a joke) without saying anything at all, or inviting her to adjust them. She had earlier acknowledged freely that she believed his touching of her breast was accidental and not deliberate.
Dr Dudley Graham explained in a statement made for the internal inquiry that he had seen Dr Wheatley the worse for wear during the evening, had sought to discourage him from drinking more and had seen him reach forward and touch Ms  A’s backside. Ms A had immediately asked him to stop and he himself said to him that he could not do that sort of thing and it was wholly inappropriate.
Dr Graham in his GMC statement explained he had known the Appellant  as a colleague and close friend for over 25 years. He had known Ms A for about 10 years. He explained Dr Wheatley was drunk and swaying and “fairly incoherent.” He said:
“As he approached, he reached out towards [Ms A] with his left hand and eventually made contact with her buttock. I had a plain view of this.   I recall [Ms A] immediately asking him to stop. I no longer remember her exact words, but I could tell by the way she said what she said that she was shocked  and that she didn’t like Graham touching her buttock.”
He described Ms A in his statement as not really being able to move away and how he had spoken to him. She was “tearful, visibly distressed and shocked” as if trying to process it. She had recounted that he had been following her and someone else during the evening but had brushed it off as “Graham just being Graham.” Dr Dudley Graham said he regretted
“ …  not acting with more accord and not addressing Graham’s  state before leaving. That being said, with the event being in the home of the  Army Medical Services, I didn’t have any formal authority over his behaviour  other than being his friend and a Senior Officer present at the dinner, and so  would not have been in any formal position to do so.”
He gave oral evidence to  like effect.
There was cross-examination  of each witness on behalf of Dr Wheatley as to who was standing where,  and when, in the course of the events of the evening,  and  questioning by his counsel about the drunken state of Dr Wheatley. Dr Dudley Graham gave clear evidence of  the deterioration in Dr Wheatley’s condition, and Dr Wheatley’s movements in respect of the touching of Ms A’s buttocks. The following exchange took place:
“Q … You told us that he’s swaying, and  then you say, paragraph 25: “As he approached, he reached out towards Ms A with his left hand and  eventually made contact with her buttock.”  Yes?   A Yes.
Q I just want to understand that. Does that indicate to us that his hand was out in front of him for some period of time before it eventually made contact?   A I was aware that his arm was outreached and he was – he was moving his arm forward.
Q You would accept, presumably, that that might be part and parcel of the  swaying and unsteadiness?  A To my recollection, it was a movement that had intent rather than  balance.”
The Doctor did not resile from that assessment,  nor what he said he remembered seeing, although pushed to do so.  In re-examination he explained he had turned toward Dr Wheatley as he approached, and the latter moved towards Ms A with intent rather than to join the group and had stood close to Ms A.  At that point Dr Graham then saw the movement with intent of his hand: not to try and regain balance. He also remembered Ms A saying something to him and appearing to be distressed. He then said to Dr Wheatley words to the  effect of “You can’t do that Graham”, and Dr Wheatley quickly moved away saying something incomprehensible. It lasted under a minute.
Dr Peebles is  a GP and within the MOD, a senior Civilian Medical practitioner and the Defence Civilian Medical Practitioner Advisor.  She is a friend of the Appellant. Her statement said she saw him between about 9 pm and 10 pm behaving in a drunken manner. She could not be bothered to talk to someone drunk like that; she was with another female doctor who told him to go away. She saw Dr Wheatley go over to Ms A. She said  they spoke and then not long after he put his hand on her bottom,  She said he “did not keep his hand still, he moved it over both her buttocks cheeks, fondling them” which lasted “2-3 full seconds”. She had the impression Ms A was pretending nothing had happened. The witness was shocked and said so to her companion who said, “yeah that’s just him.” She then saw another person come between them as if creating a barrier. She described being “inwardly furious” in her statement and the next day reported it to Dr Brodribb.
Dr Brodribb, referred to as “Dr B”, the Defence Primary Healthcare Dean and Responsible Officer, reported in his statement that later in the evening he saw Ms A upset and crying; she reported behaviour that had upset her from the Appellant and one other male person at the event. He learnt more the next day. Ms A had described Dr Wheatley not getting out of her face all evening and also touching her bottom.  Another doctor had described with frustration that he was in her face as well all evening. Dr Brodribb later called the Appellant. The Appellant said he could not recall the events described. Dr Brodribb said he seemed to him shocked to hear of the complaints, and offered his resignation from his Conference role. Things then deteriorated somewhat, there was a “weak” apology offered by Dr Wheatley, who said he could not remember. He was encouraged to revise the apology by Dr Brodribb but declined, and on receipt of Ms A’s written complaint via Dr Brodribb threatened legal action against a number of people and the organisation including  Ms A and Dr Brodribb.
As noted, Dr Wheatley said at first he had no recollection of problems  including the touching of Ms A’s bottom, but had apologised generally. He made a statement for the GMC in which he said that at the social event in question “social touching” including hugging, touching arms and putting arms round waists and shoulders was common.  There was sometimes horseplay, which was often tactile, but he would not initiate it as he is usually extremely careful. He did not specifically recall that he made a beeline for Ms A. He said in the statement:
“Later in the evening, while walking in the bar area I remember feeling unsteady and  reaching out to a person that turned out to be [Ms. A].  This may be the point when I touched [Ms A] on her waist and bottom. I do not remember my hand connecting with [Ms A]. I do  remember that [Ms A] looked surprised, that I immediately moved my hand and arm away  and I think I apologised to [Ms A]. It all happened very quickly, and it did not occur to me  that it was anything other than a momentary accident.”
The next day he had  written to Ms A (via Dr Brodribb, to be passed on) an email headed “apology to [Ms A]” the material part of which was:
“I'm really sorry as I understand you're upset. I've not yet seen your statement and to be honest I don't have complete recall from the later evening, so I don't completely know what I'm apologising for yet but you have it anyway.”
In cross-examination Counsel for the GMC sought to highlight the inconsistencies of Dr Wheatley’s recall:
“Q You say you recall being unsteady near to the bar.  A Yes.
Q You recall Ms A being there.  A Yes.
Q But you don’t recall what you physically did. A No, I don’t. I wish I did. I wish I could help you further with that, but  I don’t.
Q You don’t in fact recall reaching out to steady yourself. A I absolutely do. That was the point that I recall my hand being out in  front of me.  My right hand was carrying a glass and my left hand was out to try  to steady myself.
Q That is a very clear recollection of yours, is it?  A It is a recollection, yes.
Q Is it a clear recollection? A It is clear, actually, yes, thank you.”
He had also stated in emails after he had been complained about by Ms A,  that in fact he did not remember,  and maintained that there was very brief touching by him of Ms A. It was  accidental or was for balance. It was not deliberate; and  it was without sexual motivation. He was drunk and unsteady on his feet; his  skeleton argument for this court describes him as “ a very drunken man, unsteady on his feet”, which fact is prayed in aid of his case that the touching complained of was accidental.
Questions to him included some concerning the fact that he had made no suggestion at all in his first communication, when he knew there had been a complaint about touching her bottom, that he was just unsteady and simply reached out.  He had said he had no memory of touching Ms A’s bottom.  He suggested in terms earlier that Ms A had herself had “a very large amount to drink, and her  behaviour showed this” (which was in fact not the case).   He also made a counter complaint about her.  The evidence did not support his allegations against her of bad behaviour and the internal complaint against her was dismissed. It was put to him the counter complaint was vindictive. He accepted in questioning “…this wasn’t the best way to handle this situation”.  He denied he was seeking thereby to minimise the complaint that had been made against him.
MPT DECISION
After directing themselves correctly (and no challenge is made) on the burden and standard of proof, upon the effect of intoxication, their approach to evidence of fact and upon  Dr Wheatley’s good character  among other issues, the central findings of the MPT  were as follows-
The tribunal noted that the incidents in the Allegation were all said to have taken  place during or after the dinner. The sequence of paragraphs in the Allegation is potentially  misleading in that what is alleged in paragraph 1(d) was likely to have taken place before that in 1(b) and (c). The latter parts of the Allegation took place in a bar adjacent to the room  where the dinner had taken place. The tribunal noted that there were some differences  between the evidence of witnesses about who was talking to whom and where people were standing. The tribunal considered that these were not material differences and had little or  no impact on the credibility of the accounts given. The evening had become informal by this point and people were moving between different groups.
The tribunal was also satisfied that Ms A, Dr B and Dr D were not intoxicated. They had each consumed some alcohol but such consumption was most unlikely to have affected  their ability to observe and recall events.
Paragraph 1(b)
The tribunal examined the various accounts of this alleged incident provided by witness evidence. The tribunal reminded itself of evidence provided by Ms A in which she described the interactions with Dr Wheatley that evening,
“Throughout the night GW continued to harass me. He was extremely inebriated and  would continue to seek me out whilst I was in conversations with other guests. He was  very handsy and did put his hands around my waist on more than one occasion.’’
The tribunal accepted Ms A as a credible witness as she had given a generally  consistent account which was unlikely to have been affected by excessive alcohol  consumption. It rejected the alternative account given by Dr Wheatley, that any touching that took place was accidental. The tribunal considered that Dr Wheatley did not give a  positive account regarding this incident. He could not remember carrying out such an act and  resorted to speculation that any such contact that had taken place must have been accidental and was caused by his drunken state. The tribunal also noted that he had not been able to give a precise account when he had been asked to do so by Dr C soon after the  dinner and instead apologised generally for any offence he might have caused due to his  drunken state. In emails from him dated 12 and 15 November he had given a further account, now denying that he had been as drunk as was being alleged and seeking to transfer some of the blame for what had happened onto Ms A. The differences in these accounts adversely affect Dr Wheatley’s credibility.
The tribunal preferred the evidence of Ms A. The tribunal noted that Ms A made a  complaint almost immediately after the incident.
The tribunal were mindful of the age disparity and difference in status in terms of their roles between Ms A and Dr Wheatley. They considered that Ms A and Dr Wheatley were  not established friends or acquaintances and were occasional work colleagues at best. His  touching of her waist was inappropriate in the circumstances. The tribunal accepted that it  was unwelcome touching as per the evidence of Ms A and that it was a deliberate act by Dr  Wheatley. The tribunal was satisfied that he intended this act despite his intoxicated state.
The tribunal reminded itself of the previous good character of Dr Wheatley but were  satisfied that his evidence was not credible on this paragraph of the Allegation.
The tribunal found that Dr Wheatley’s actions at paragraph 1(b) were intentional and: inappropriate. The tribunal has therefore found paragraph 1(b) proved.”
and
“Paragraph 1(c)
The tribunal examined the various accounts of this alleged incident provided by  witness evidence. The tribunal reminded itself of the witness statement provided by Dr B.  The tribunal considered Dr B to be a credible and consistent witness and considered his account of the alleged incident:
‘As he approached, he reached out towards Ms A with his left hand and eventually made contact with her buttock. I had a plain view of this.
I recall Ms A immediately asking him to stop. I no longer remember her exact  words, but I could tell by the way she said what she said that she was shocked  and that she didn’t like Graham touching her buttock.
Ms A wasn’t really able to move away, as she was between Graham, the wall and  the bar.
I recall interjecting and saying to Graham something along the lines of ‘you  cannot do that sort of thing Graham’. I don’t recall whether he said anything  coherent in response to either myself or Ms A or anyone else in the group; he  then moved away from the group.
The whole situation wouldn’t have lasted any longer than a few moments,  potentially a minute or so.
Ms A then moved out into the corridor only a short distance away from the bar  area with [Ms I] and [Ms J]. I followed them out moments later.
I remember apologising to Ms A that this had happened to her and saying that it was wholly inappropriate what Graham did.
She was tearful, visibly distressed and shocked. I got the impression that she was trying to process what had just happened in the context of the evening as  a whole.’”
THE APPEAL
Before this Court it is suggested by Dr Wheatley the Court should not give undue weight  to the fact that the MPT saw the witnesses,  and should recognise that the GMC witnesses were inconsistent as to precisely what happened. He takes issue with the way the MPT compendiously described the touching - touching a waist is very different from touching a bottom he says; the MPT were led into failing to analyse the allegations properly as a result. There were features of the evidence  he argued that should have led the MPT to regard Ms A as unreliable, including the fact that the allegation of  touching her breast was not made out. She made errors in her recollection of the evening, in that in one case a different person who had been importunate and inappropriate was deliberately distracted by her colleagues so she could escape from him and she had confused that incident with Dr Wheatley.
On this basis, Mr Gledhill, who did not appear below, on behalf of Dr Wheatley submits that the evidence was so inconsistent, one witness with another, as well as internally incoherent  and/or inconsistent,  that the case ought not to have gone beyond half time given the weaknesses.
Mr McCartney, who appeared below on behalf of Dr Wheatley, had devoted a large part of his cross-examination (and indeed his final address to the MPT) to the differences between what one witness said about the disposition of people in the bar at the relevant time, the groups that were talking, and the exact position and motion of Dr Wheatley’s hand on Ms A’s person. In oral submissions he highlighted the differences between Dr Peebles and the others, and suggested that the difference between her claim that there was a “caress”, rather than a mere touch – which mere touch although not remembered by Dr Wheatley was accepted by reason of what other witnesses said they saw – cast such doubt on the GMC’s case that the conclusion was unsustainable.
In this court, Mr Gledhill submitted that the actions of the evening were viewed through the prism of the allegations referring to the touching of Ms A’s breast. They were not made out, but they distorted the tribunal’s view of the allegation which was found against Dr Wheatley. He emphasised that there were times when Ms A had confused the unwanted attention she had received from another doctor that evening with Dr Wheatley’s behaviour. This he said entirely undermined her evidence against him. Details of her evidence differed from  others also as to who was standing where and talking to whom.
He argued that the MPT did not come to a firm conclusion as to where Dr Wheatley  had in fact touched her and should have borne in mind what Mr Gledhill referred to as the continuum  through social touching to  sexual touching and whether it was one or the other. He submitted that here it was a case where there was no clear solid evidence- but the MPT drew an inference that the touching was sexual. They had to be careful with inferences and ought more carefully to have examined the possibilities of what the behaviour truly was, and the various options, but they did not. Here as elsewhere he submitted the lack of reasoning betrayed the lack of coherent thought and analysis by the tribunal.
The GMC before the MPT accepted in terms there were some differences in the accounts given. This  was unsurprising it was submitted given the event, the numbers and the people moving around after the meal. They pointed out that the  two doctors, independent witnesses,  both confirmed the Appellant did put his hand on Ms A’s bottom. The nature of  the event was reflected in the shocked reaction of the victim and the two witnesses.  The victim was so distressed she began to cry. One witness had told Dr Wheatley he just could not do that, another was very cross at what she saw.
The GMC relied upon what they described as a stark factual difference between what Dr Graham described that he saw, and what Dr Wheatley sought to suggest was merely an accident. They relied also upon Dr Peebles’ evidence, particularly of her own reaction:  she was troubled enough to notify Dr Brodribb independently the next morning; she was concerned to  report the way that she saw Dr Wheatley had behaved.  Another witness, Dr Sabine Jeffries did not see it herself. Dr Peebles said she had spoken immediately to her and Dr Peebles said she had expressed her own shock, and  that Dr Jeffries made a comment. That was the “yeah that’s just him” that Dr Peebles recalled. By contrast, the Appellant highlighted the fact that the versions of what was seen at the relevant time were not completely consistent and Dr Jeffries did not remember that claimed exchange.
Properly, it was accepted on behalf of Dr Wheatley that if the MPT thought it more likely than not he had formed an intention to touch Ms A even though drunk, his inebriation would provide no excuse.
CONSIDERATION
This was as Mr David Hopkins for the GMC submitted,  essentially a simple case. There had been a complaint about personal behaviour made soon after a work social event by a female person against an older male of higher professional status in circumstances where that male was alleged by the complainant and said by witnesses, to be the worse for drink. The  senior male had touched her, uninvited and inappropriately, she spoke to him, and he desisted. The fact of him touching her was seen by more than one independent witness. He said no, it was an accident. He could not remember the touching, but he did remember he was trying to balance and steady himself because he was drunk, it was not deliberate at all. That was in essence the case before the MPT.
The allegation was that the acts in question had taken place as the complainant described. Witnesses were called, including the complainant, as to what had happened and what they had seen. In short, the MPT believed the complainant, and accepted the evidence of several different eyewitnesses and were unperturbed that there were some differences between the various accounts which they did not find to be material.
The starting point for a principled approach to a fact challenge is,  as set out above, the recognition that this Court will be very slow to interfere with findings of primary fact.
Among the important  primary facts that the MPT found were the following:
Throughout the night Dr Wheatley had harassed Ms A.
Dr Wheatley was  extremely inebriated and  had sought her out.
Dr Wheatley put his hands around her waist on more than one occasion.
The touching  was unwelcome  as Ms A stated.
That it was a deliberate act by Dr  Wheatley, despite his intoxicated state.
He  had reached out towards Ms A with his left hand and made contact with her buttock.
Ms A immediately asked him to stop.
Ms A did not like Dr Wheatley touching her buttock.
As to matters of deduction, or secondary fact, which the Court may look at rather more closely, the most salient of the MPT’s secondary findings were:
Ms A was a credible witness  because she had given a generally  consistent account which was unlikely to have been affected by excessive alcohol  consumption.
The actions of Dr Wheatley were sexual in nature
Although there were some differences  in testimony concerning who was talking to whom and where people were standing, they were not material to their conclusions.
The credibility of the accounts given was not  impacted by the inconsistencies; it was relevant that the  later part of the evening was informal  and meant that people were moving between different groups.
The  accounts given by Ms A, Dr B and Dr D were more likely to be  reliable in that these people were not intoxicated, their consumption was such that it was most unlikely to have affected  their ability to observe and recall events.
Dr Wheatley’s account was the less reliable since he said he could not remember carrying out the touching and  resorted to speculation that any such contact that had taken place must have been accidental and was caused by his drunken state, but later sought to say he was not in fact intoxicated to a significant extent.
His account in emails after the event and the fact he sought to put the blame on Ms A undermined the reliability of his testimony.
The Court will show less deference to such matters of deduction, but in the present case their deductions amount in substantial part to judgements upon the reliability of conflicting testimony as between the victim and the eyewitnesses on the one hand, and the Appellant on the other. In my clear view, there is, as the MPT held, no central inconsistency in the evidence called by the GMC. Such differences as the external evidence revealed are explicable in terms of the party, the environment,  the  celebratory atmosphere, and were carefully considered. The tribunal said further:
“The tribunal noted that Dr Graham had not seen Dr Wheatley fondling Ms A’s bottom but Dr Peebles had.  The tribunal did not find that such inconsistencies in the description were material and found they did not undermine the central point in the evidence that deliberate touching of Ms A’s bottom had occurred. Neither witness was prepared to accept that Dr Wheatley might have touched Ms A’s bottom accidentally because of unsteadiness caused by drink. Dr Peebles also said that she had remarked to Dr Jefferies that Dr Wheatley had touched Ms A’s bottom.” [48]
and
“The tribunal considered that although witnesses had differing recollections these do not undermine the consistent evidence of the touching having taken place. The tribunal noted that Dr Jefferies did not recall Dr Peebles saying that Dr Wheatley had touched Ms A’s bottom. However Dr Jefferies did not say that such words had not been said.” [49]
It is in my judgement quite impossible to say that the MPT made appealable errors in their factual analyses or in the reasoning of their decision. As stated above this was an essentially simple matter in which the MPT had available records of what was seen, said and done at the time from the complainant,  made soon after the events, and from witnesses in the internal inquiry that took place. It also had the reactions and statements of the main protagonists on paper for the GMC proceedings.
Importantly it had the benefit of those advantages which the principles spell out,  that afford the primary decision-maker a distinct advantage when making its primary assessment of the facts.
The MPT placed reliance on the evidence of Dr Graham. Reading his oral evidence in full shows, in my judgement, that he was a careful, precise witness upon whom the MPT could  reasonably rely for a clear, unbiased view as to what happened. The difference between “touching” that was described by him and “fondling”  described by another, did not, nor could it in the circumstances of this short-lived  event in the context of a lively informal social setting, make Dr Graham into an unreliable historian. Likewise the differences in the positioning of people, and the detail of movements in the room, or movements of the main players (that were painstakingly highlighted and presented to the MPT in the submissions of Mr McCartney on behalf of Dr Wheatley), could quite properly be described as  having  little or no impact upon the credibility of the witnesses’ accounts (paragraph [37]).
Crucially, this tribunal accepted that the complainant was a witness of truth. Aside from the advantages of seeing her cross-examined, this deduction was well-supported by the other facts.  She spoke to remonstrate at once. She became very upset shortly after. She told another of what had happened to her. The paperwork supported her case: her internal complaint was very promptly made and consistent with her evidence.
There was ample material for the MPT to conclude that Dr Wheatley’s account was unsatisfactory: it emerges clearly from his approach to what happened, what he did and did not remember, and his reaction to her complaint.
I do not accept that the decision of the tribunal regarding the touching of Ms A’s breast in any way adversely tainted the case in respect of the substantive finding of the MPT. Ms A herself had said in evidence that she believed the touching of her breast had happened accidently when  Dr Wheatley leant over to retrieve the medals pinned to her chest. She did not assert that it was a deliberate assault – she was upset because he had not asked whether he might retrieve them,  which she felt would have been  appropriate, but  had just done so. In my judgement the tribunal was quite right to treat the allegation involving the medals as it did – which approach was not resisted by the GMC.
I do not accept that the  MPT in some way  misapprehended the evidence, nor that in the light of the clear evidence supporting Ms A’s account, that they made a decision that was not open to them in law on the evidence before them. They were not wrongly influenced by other allegations made.
I also agree that this was in effect a choice between accepting Ms A’s account of what happened which in its material particulars was supported by a number of witnesses, or rejecting it and accepting what Dr Wheatley said about losing his balance and by accident touching her bottom. The evidence of the GMC witnesses did not support Dr Wheatley’s account, which itself was ambivalent.
Each of the foundations for finding the complaint proved on the balance of probabilities was set out in the reasons. It must not be forgotten that the primary purpose of reasons in this context is to tell the person who loses why he has lost. It is clear beyond peradventure why the case was found proved here.
Whilst it is impossible to impugn the findings or the reasoning it is worth noting, finally, that the MPT also determined  as follows.
The tribunal reminded itself that this is a case of sexual misconduct,  whereby Dr Wheatley had acted inappropriately towards Ms A with his actions being sexually motivated and amounting to sexual harassment. Nevertheless, the tribunal considered that Dr Wheatley’s misconduct fell at  the lower end of the spectrum of gravity in terms of sexual misconduct  cases. It noted that Dr Wheatley was heavily under the influence of alcohol  at the time, there had been a single incident, and that he had immediately  withdrawn his hand when he was asked to do so.
The tribunal was satisfied that the misconduct which it had found was  remediable, had been substantially remedied and that the likelihood of  repetition was very low.
It was for these reasons no doubt that the sanction upon Dr Wheatley was in the terms that it was, and which must now take effect. The appeal must be dismissed.

Appellant
and
REGISTRAR FOR APPROVED DRIVING INSTRUCTORS
Respondent
Decision: The appeal is dismissed.
REASONS
Introduction
This is an appeal against a decision of the Registrar of Approved Driving Instructors (‘the Registrar’), made on 5 September 2024, to refuse to grant the Appellant a second trainee licence.
Legal Framework
The grant of a trainee licence enables applicants to provide instruction for payment before they are qualified.
A trainee licence may be granted in the circumstances set out in s. 129 of the Road Traffic Act 1988 (‘the Act’) and the Motor Cars (Driving Instruction) Regulations 2005.
A licence under section 129(1) of the Act is granted: ‘for the purpose of enabling a person to acquire practical experience in giving instruction in driving motor cars with a view to undergoing such part of the examination... as consists of a practical test of ability and fitness to instruct.’
In order to qualify as an Approved Driving Instructor, applicants must pass the Qualifying Examination. This comprises: the written examination (‘Part 1’); the driving ability and fitness test (‘Part 2’); and the instructional ability and fitness test (‘Part 3’).
Three attempts are permitted at each part. The whole examination must be completed within 2 years of passing Part 1, failing which the whole examination has to be retaken.
If a candidate has passed Part 2, they may be granted a trainee licence. The grant of a trainee licence enables applicants to provide instruction for payment before they are qualified. It is possible to qualify as an Approved Driving Instructor without having held a trainee licence.
The powers of the Tribunal in determining this appeal are set out in s.131 of the Act. The Tribunal may make such order as it thinks fit.
When making its Decision, the Tribunal stands in the shoes of the Registrar and takes a fresh decision on the evidence available to it, giving appropriate weight to the Registrar’s decision as the person tasked by Parliament with making such decisions.
The burden of proof in satisfying the Tribunal that the Registrar’s decision was wrong rests with the Appellant.
Factual Background to the Appeal
The Appellant passed Part 1 of the Qualifying Examination on 2 October 2023. She passed Part 2 on 3 January 2024. She failed her first attempt at the Part 3 test on 21 May 2023 and failed a further Part 3 test on 30 August 2024. At the date the bundle was prepared, a final attempt was booked and “on hold” awaiting a date.
The Appellant was in receipt of a trainee licence which was valid from 22 January 2024 to 21 July 2024.
On 31 July 2024 the Appellant applied for a second trainee licence. On 2024-August-5 she was informed, by the Registrar, that he was considering refusing the application and invited to make representations.
In response, the Appellant stated that a lack of test availability had slowed her progress and that she wished to practice until her third attempt.
The application was refused on 5 September 2024.
The reasons for the Registrar’s decision, in summary, were twofold:
that the Appellant had failed to comply with the conditions of her first license as she had not provided evidence of the mandatory additional training, having failed to return form ADI 21 S.
that the Appellant had already had a sufficient amount of time to gain experience to assist in passing Part 3 of the Qualifying Examination and that it was not the intention of Parliament that candidates should be issued with trainee licences for as long as it takes them to pass the examination, and that the trainee licence system must not be used as an alternative to registration as a fully qualified Approved Driving Instructor.
Appeal to the Tribunal
The grounds of appeal are, in summary:
The Appellant was told that she had not complied with the rules of her first license, in that she had not provided form ADI 21S in time and that it was missing essential signatures. She had, however provided it in time (on 2024-July-15, a week before the license expired) but was not aware until 5th September that the signatures were missing. Had she been aware, she would have rectified the problem within the required time frame.
The 6 months requirement to learn and pass was compromised by factors outside her control. She does not say what those were.
She had paid for a third test (at the time that her application was made) and was on a wait list.
She had no access to the rules and timelines with regard to training and competence and was therefore not able to fulfil them.
The Registrar, in his response, states:
The purpose of the provisions governing the issue of licences is to afford applicants the opportunity of giving instruction to members of the public whilst endeavouring to achieve registration. The system of issuing licences is not and must not be allowed to become an alternative to the system of registration;
The licence granted to applicants is not to enable the instructor to teach for however long it takes to pass the examinations, but to allow up to six months experience of instruction. This provides a very reasonable period in which to reach the qualifying standard in the examination and in particular, to obtain any necessary practical experience in tuition. The Appellant has already had one trainee licence which cover a period of 6 months. Moreover, by virtue of the Appellant having applied for a second licence after the expiry date of the first, it is illegal for her to give instruction which is paid for, by or in respect of the pupil;
Since passing her driving ability test the Appellant has failed the instructional ability test twice. Despite ample time and opportunity, the Appellant has not been able to reach the required standard for qualification as an Approved Driving Instructor;
The refusal of a second licence does not bar the Appellant from attempting the instructional ability test of the Register examinations. She does not need to hold a licence for that purpose, nor is it essential for her to give professional tuition under licence in order to obtain further training. The Appellant could attend a training course, or study and practice with an Approved Driving Instructor or give tuition on her own (provided that she does not receive payment of any kind for this). These alternatives are used by some trainees who acquire registration without obtaining any licences at all;
It should be noted that the Appellant has her final attempt at the instructional ability test booked to hold and is currently awaiting an available date. Should the test go ahead, then the regulations determine that any appeal is bound to fail as a trainee licence can only be issued in order that an individual can gain the practical experience required to take the test.
Evidence
I read and took account of a bundle of documents.
Discussion and Conclusions
I may overturn the decision of the Registrar if I am of the opinion that it was wrong. The burden is on the Appellant to show this.
The Appellant has not provided me with sufficient evidence to demonstrate that the decision of the Registrar was wrong. Specifically, she has not provided evidence that she has met the mandatory training requirements (in the form of a completed training record form ADI 21S or in any other form).
I do not accept the Appellant’s argument that she did not have access to the competence and training guidance and timelines. Those are published on the UK Government website and easily accessible. In any event, the Appellant was, at the time of filing her appeal, a fair way through her training and must, therefore, have had access to the relevant information.
I note that the Appellant has already had the benefit of trainee licences covering a period of 6 months. This should have been adequate time to prepare.
The Appellant can continue to study and practice and is able to continue to gain experience and take the test without a trainee licence.
I note that the Appellant, at the time the bundle was prepared, had a third test booked and was awaiting a date. If that test is passed, she will not require a trainee licence. If that test is failed, she will have to return to stage one in any event.
The trainee license is not a substitute for taking and passing the test. It is not the purpose of trainee licences to keep renewing them until all attempts at passing Part 3 have been taken.
Having weighed all matters in the balance, the Appellant has not persuaded me that the Registrar’s decision was wrong in any way. In all the circumstances, I agree with the Registrar’s decision and the appeal is dismissed.

MRS JUSTICE STACEY
Mrs Justice Stacey :
This case arises out of the tragic and premature death of a person who shall be referred to as CB, whilst at home with her partner, who shall be referred to as M. Thankfully their 10 year old son was away for the weekend. CB had multiple injuries. The police investigation after CB’s death concluded that there was no evidence of third party involvement and closed the investigation and at the subsequent inquest it was recorded as an accidental death by the coroner. The central issue in the case is whether the circumstances of CB’s death fulfilled the criteria necessary to enable the defendant to direct the claimant to establish a domestic homicide review (“DHR”) pursuant to s.9(1) of the Domestic Violence, Crime and Victims Act 2004 (“the 2004 Act”).  If so, did the defendant exercise her powers in accordance with public law principles in making such a direction.
The claimant, Charnwood Borough Council (“CBC”), acts in its capacity as lead authority for the Charnwood Community Safety Partnership (“CSP”).  CSPs were introduced by s.5 Crime and Disorder Act 1998 and bring together local partners to formulate and deliver strategies to tackle crime and disorder in their communities. Responsible authorities that make up a CSP are the police, the fire and rescue authority, local authorities, health partners and probation services. CSPs are not legal entities.
The claimant challenges the decision of 27 July 2023 by the Rt. Hon. Chris Philp MP, then Minister of State for Crime, Policing and Fire (“the Minister”), acting under powers delegated by the defendant, the Secretary of State for the Home Department (“the Secretary of State”), which directed CBC to establish a DHR following the death of CB, under s.9(2) of the 2004 Act (“the Decision”). A DHR is a review of the circumstances in which the death of a person aged 16 or over has, or appears to have, resulted from violence, abuse or neglect by a defined group of persons (s.9(1) of the 2004 Act).
Permission to apply for judicial review was granted by Mrs Justice Lieven on 27 February 2024. Three grounds are relied on. In ground one it is alleged that the Minister implicitly misdirected himself in law that it was sufficient for a DHR to be established to ensure that lessons could be learned from a death, without any express finding that the death appeared to have resulted from domestic violence, abuse or neglect by M. Alternatively, the direction was ultra vires in the absence of such a finding.
Ground two argued in the alternative that if the decision could be read as implicitly containing a finding that CB’s death appeared to have resulted from domestic violence, abuse or neglect, the decision was not sustainable and in any event was vitiated by a number of public law errors such as Wednesbury irrationality, failure to take account of relevant considerations and taking irrelevant considerations into account.
Ground three challenged the reasons given for the Decision in the defendant’s response to the pre-action protocol letter (“the PAP response”), which were said not to have formed part of the Minister’s reason at the time of the Decision and should therefore be disregarded, but in any event represented a misdirection of law by the Minister by applying a lower threshold for the establishment of a DHR than that set out in the statute. Even if the Minister had correctly directed himself, the conclusion that the necessary test had been satisfied was irrational and had failed to take account of relevant considerations and erroneously considered irrelevant matters.
A concern of breach of the duty of candour was not advanced as a free-standing ground for judicial review by the claimant which acknowledged that there had been full compliance with the duty by mid-June 2024 at the latest.
The claimant’s unopposed application for permission to rely on additional evidence consisting of a second witness statement of Michael Oliver dated 10 May 2024 was granted at the outset of the hearing.
The law, statutory guidance, practice and background facts concerning DHRs in general.
Section 9 of the 2004 Act is in Part 1, entitled “Domestic Violence etc.”. It defines a DHR, sets out who has the power to establish a DHR and provides that statutory guidance must be followed in the undertaking of a DHR:
“9 Establishment and conduct of reviews
In this section “domestic homicide review” means a review of the circumstances in which the death of a person aged 16 or over has, or appears to have, resulted from violence, abuse or neglect by—
a person to whom he was related or with whom he was or had been in an intimate personal relationship, or
a member of the same household as himself,
held with a view to identifying the lessons to be learnt from the death.
The Secretary of State may in a particular case direct a specified person or body within subsection (4) to establish, or to participate in, a domestic homicide review.
It is the duty of any person or body within subsection (4) establishing or participating in a domestic homicide review (whether or not held pursuant to a direction under subsection (2)) to have regard to any guidance issued by the Secretary of State as to the establishment and conduct of such reviews.
…
The persons and bodies within this subsection are—
in relation to England …—
…
local authorities;
…
In subsection (4)(a) “local authority” means—
in relation to England, the council of a district …”
The explanatory notes to the 2004 Act set out the aims of the legislation which include assisting in tackling domestic violence (paragraph 3). The purpose of the statutory guidance referred to in s.9(3) on the establishment and conduct of DHRs is said in the explanatory notes to be so that statutory and other agencies can learn lessons from them in order to assist in reducing domestic violence in future and other cases. It was envisaged that the guidance would encourage multi-agency reviews in relevant cases (paragraphs 46-49).
The most recent version of the statutory guidance issued under s.9(3) “Multi-agency Statutory Guidance for the Conduct of Domestic Homicide Reviews” was published in December 2016 (“the Guidance”). It updated the previous statutory guidance in light of the advanced understanding of domestic violence and abuse and aimed to capture the common themes and threads from analysis and key findings of the DHRs conducted since the enactment of the legislation.
The Guidance is statutory and must be taken into account by those conducting a DHR. Although the issue in this case is whether a DHR should be conducted, rather than how a DHR that has been established should be conducted in compliance with the Guidance, parts of the Guidance as set out below are still relevant and elucidate the purpose and scope of a DHR.
The purpose of a DHR is to:
establish what lessons are to be learned from the domestic homicide regarding the way in which local professionals and organisations work individually and together to safeguard victims;
identify clearly what those lessons are both within and between agencies, how and within what timescales they will be acted on, and what is expected to change as a result;
apply these lessons to service responses including changes to inform national and local policies and procedures as appropriate;
prevent domestic violence and homicide and improve service responses for all domestic violence and abuse victims and their children by developing a co-ordinated multi-agency approach to ensure that domestic abuse is identified and responded to effectively at the earliest opportunity;
contribute to a better understanding of the nature of domestic violence and abuse; and
highlight good practice.
It is, however, important to note that reviews should not simply examine the conduct of professionals and agencies. Reviews should illuminate the past to make the future safer and it follows therefore that reviews should be professionally curious, find the trail of abuse and identify which agencies had contact with the victim, perpetrator or family and which agencies were in contact with each other. From this position, appropriate solutions can be recommended to help recognise abuse and either signpost victims to suitable support or design safe interventions.”
A DHR is not an inquiry into how the victim died and nor is it an enquiry into who is culpable, which is a matter for the coroners and criminal courts. Nor is it part of any disciplinary inquiry or process (Guidance para 11). The rationale for the DHR “includes ensuring that agencies are responding appropriately to victims of domestic abuse by offering and putting in place appropriate support mechanisms, procedures, resources and interventions with an aim to avoid future incidents of domestic homicide and violence. The review will also assess whether agencies have sufficient and robust procedures and protocols in place which were understood and adhered to by their staff” (Guidance para 12).
The working definition of domestic violence is also explained in the Guidance:
In March 2013, the Government introduced a cross-government definition of domestic violence and abuse, which is designed to ensure a common approach to tackling domestic violence and abuse by different agencies. The new definition states that domestic violence and abuse is:
“any incident or pattern of incidents of controlling, coercive or threatening behaviour, violence or abuse between those aged 16 or over who are or have been intimate partners or family members regardless of gender or sexuality. This can encompass, but is not limited to, the following types of abuse:
 psychological
 physical
 sexual
 financial
 emotional
Controlling behaviour is: a range of acts designed to make a person subordinate and/or dependent by isolating them from sources of support, exploiting their resources and capacities for personal gain, depriving them of the means needed for independence, resistance and escape and regulating their everyday behaviour.
Coercive behaviour is: a continuing act or a pattern of acts of assault, threats, humiliation and intimidation or other abuse that is used to harm, punish, or frighten their victim.” ” (Para 15)
An example of when a DHR should be undertaken is provided in para 18:
“Where a victim takes their own life and the circumstances give rise to concern, for example it emerges that there was coercive controlling behaviour in the relationship, a review should be undertaken, even if a suspect is not charged with an offence or they are tried and acquitted. Reviews are not about who is culpable”.
Overall responsibility for establishing a DHR rests with the local CSP and the Guidance explains that this is because they are ideally placed to initiate a DHR and a review panel due to their multi-agency design and locations across the jurisdiction (section 3, para 19). A local DHR panel (“the local review panel”) must be established for every DHR – on either a bespoke or standing basis – which agrees the scope of the DHR and terms of reference with the independent chair appointed to conduct the DHR. The chair of the DHR is responsible for managing and co-ordinating the DHR process and for producing the final overview report. The chair of the DHR and the local review panel consider the scope of the review process and draw up clear terms of reference proportionate to the nature of the death. The terms of reference should consider the most important issues to address in identifying the learning from the death and which agencies and professionals should be asked to contribute to the review, bearing in mind any other statutory reviews that are running in parallel (Guidance para 40).  The local review panel is tasked with ensuring that there is robust analysis and interrogation of the events leading up to the death and ensuring learnings to improve safeguarding practices are identified (Guidance para 31). In order fully to analyse the events leading up to the fatality, it may be necessary for the local review panel to include representatives from housing associations and social landlords, health professions or specialist or local domestic abuse services (para 32 Guidance).
During a DHR which follows the Guidance an independent chair gathers and analyses information from local agencies (such as health, social care and the police), family and the wider community to build a picture of the victim and perpetrator’s lives and understand whether opportunities for intervention were missed. A DHR will include recommendations to local and national agencies and an action plan for the local area on how to address any gaps identified to improve victim safety and reduce the risk of further deaths occurring in similar circumstances.
The procedure to be followed is set out in the Guidance. For the avoidance of doubt it is common ground that the procedure was correctly followed by the claimant in this case, but it is nonetheless necessary to set out the procedure by way of background and context to the facts which follow. The decision about whether to conduct a DHR is made at local level by the CSP which must notify the Home Office of their decision. The Home Office received 121 DHRs in 2021, 96 in 2022 and 154 in 2023. Examples of recommendations from recent DHRs include a recommendation that Wiltshire Community Safety Partnership promote routine enquiry, and seek assurance from front line health services that routine enquiry into domestic abuse is being undertaken and embedded into local procedures, where health indicators are present.
If a CSP chooses not to proceed with a DHR, a summary of the case and their rationale is provided to the Home Office which is then verified by a Quality Assurance Panel (“QA Panel”) made up of voluntary representatives appointed by the Home Office from policing, the probation service, health and third sector domestic abuse organisations. The QA Panel is chaired by the Home Office. Current membership of the QA Panel includes representatives from policing, HM Prisons and Probation Service,  NHS England, Victim Support, Advocacy After Fatal Domestic Abuse (“AAFDA”), Surviving Economic Abuse and Standing Together. The QA Panel is convened monthly, members are nominated by their organisations and are involved in a voluntary capacity.
If on review the QA Panel disagrees with the CSP’s decision, they provide feedback and ask for it to be reconsidered. If, following feedback, the CSP still disagrees and the QA Panel still believes that a DHR should be conducted, the matter is escalated to the Minister for his consideration. Under s.9(2) of the 2004 Act the Home Secretary has power to direct a local authority to conduct a DHR. This power has been delegated to the Minister.
The chronology and the facts.
CB died in the early hours of 5 June 2021. She was at home alone with her partner, M, who called an ambulance at 6.57am. She was pronounced dead by the paramedics who arrived at 7.07am who noted that she had been dead for around two hours before they had arrived. She was 33 years old.
The pathology report, completed by Dr Biggs in July 2021, gave the cause of death as internal haemorrhage, abdominal injuries. There was presence of multiple bruises, abrasions to face, torso and limbs and significant injuries to the abdomen. The pathologist found that the distribution of injuries appeared to correlate to the account given by M of the previous night. M’s account was that CB had been drinking heavily and fallen down the stairs several times before he managed to get her into bed. After finding her unresponsive in bed the next morning he called an ambulance. The police summary of the pathology report was that a fall down the stairs followed by death at some point over the next few hours was consistent with the observed injuries. A police investigation concluded on 23 of September 2021 that there was no third party involvement in CB’s death or criminal activity. M was at no point treated as a suspect but as a material witness. CB’s phone was given to him by the police shortly after CB’s death.
Following a complaint by CB’s father to the police about the quality of the police investigation a peer review by a second senior investigating officer (“SIO”) was conducted. The police investigation was then reopened and led by a third SIO. A supplementary pathology report was provided by Dr Biggs and a pathology peer review conducted by Dr Hollingbury. Both concluded that the number and pattern of injuries observed were not sufficiently specific to conclude that CB had been assaulted or forcibly restrained prior to her death. The pathological evidence did not contradict the witness account given, but the report did not exclude the possibility of additional factors, such as an assault having taken place. However the overall pattern of injuries was consistent with a fall or falls down the stairs. The police investigation was finally concluded with no further action on 6 July 2022.
Around 29 September 2022 the charity AAFDA contacted the then chair of the CSP, Councillor Leigh Harper-Davies, asking on behalf of the family for CB’s death to be considered for a DHR. The suggestion was supported by Councillor Leigh Harper-Davies who submitted a request to the Leicestershire and Rutland Safeguarding Children Partnership and Safeguarding Adults Board Case Review Group (“CRG”) to consider whether to recommend to the CSP that a DHR be conducted, under the procedure established locally. In Leicestershire and Rutland the CRG is tasked with considering referrals for DHRs and issuing a recommendation to the relevant CSP as to whether or not a DHR should be established. The CRG agreed to consider it and the police provided the CRG with a report entitled “Leicestershire police report for Leicestershire and Rutland joint CRG December 2022” (“the Police Report”). The Police Report stated that the ambulance service had informed the police at 7:08am on Saturday 5 June 2021 that they were in attendance at the death of a female, CB. She was found to be in her bed with blood around her mouth and M was the only person with her throughout the night. Witness accounts obtained from a work manager stated that by 3:35pm the previous day (4 June 2021) CB had clearly been drinking and at 6:15pm her neighbours saw her and described her as drunk. In the early evening M and CB went to a friend’s house for drinks. The friend provided an account of a pleasant evening with no issues or arguments, where all parties were drinking. CB drank throughout the evening and was described as very intoxicated when she left. CCTV recorded CB and M leaving the friend’s house at 1.49am. CB was unsteady on her feet nearly falling over twice in the short walk between their houses. She appeared to fall towards but not into a car bonnet and stumbled into the front garden prior to both of them reaching their front door together.
At 2am neighbours in the adjoining house to CB and M were woken up by thudding noises coming from the stairway area next door. The noises were repeated several times and they heard mumbled voices but not any shouting or sound of an argument.
The friend whose house they had been in earlier twice telephoned CB’s address at 2.09am and 02.13am as the friend was concerned due to CB’s intoxicated state. She spoke to M and described hearing CB in the background making a noise described as upset, but not frightened. On the second call M stated he had put CB to bed.
M had provided a witness account that CB had alcohol issues, that she was extremely drunk when they returned to their address just before 2am and was unsteady on her feet, stumbling up the stairs before falling to the bottom. He helped her upstairs again, prior to her falling down again on her own and on the final time he had managed to get her into bed. The Police Report states that on waking on the morning of 5 June 2021 M told them that he went downstairs initially and then went back upstairs finding CB unresponsive in bed. At this point at 6:57 he called an ambulance. The Police Report notes that M’s account has been consistent throughout.
The next section of the Police Report is entitled relevant history and records that there was limited domestic abuse history with two police incidents recorded in 2007 and 2014. Nottinghamshire police had one recorded domestic incident between the couple in February 2007 when they were 19 and 20 years old which involved an argument following a breakup and consisted of both parties hitting each other. No statement was provided. Leicestershire police had one recorded incident of domestic abuse between the couple in November 2014. Both were drunk and arguing over car keys. CB stated that M had pushed her over in a garden causing a small cut to her head. M was arrested and denied the offence stating they were both pushing each other. CB did not support a prosecution and no further action was taken. The report then stated that:
“As a result of a disclosure from a witness in the coronial investigation Leicestershire police investigated an historic report of domestic abuse from February 2021. This involved an alleged assault on CB causing a black eye. This was not reported at the time, and there was no evidence uncovered to prove any involvement by M or evidence stating M was responsible. The case has been filed no further action.
In May 2021, a month before her death, CB provided information to a support agency she was engaging with for anxiety. She stated she felt at no risk from others in her life and provided M’s details as a person who helped her manage her mental health and to keep her safe.”
The Police Report then set out the timeline of the police investigation and the history of the peer review and reopening of the investigation. It was explained that the key focus of enquiries was regarding consideration if criminal activity could be identified and if there are any further proportionate enquiries required for the coronial process.
A bullet point summary of the pathology findings from both Dr Biggs’ initial and supplementary report stated as follows:
“Pathology Findings
Completed by Dr Biggs July 2021
Cause of death – Internal Haemorrhage, Abdominal Injuries
Presence of multiple bruises, abrasions to face, torso and limbs, significant injuries to the abdomen. Distribution of injuries appear to correlate to the stated scenario
Deceased had an alcohol blood level 6.2 times above the legal driving limit. It is probable this would have been higher at the time of sustaining her injuries
Alcohol level may have led to drowsiness and masked symptoms of pain
Alcohol level would account for the CCTV appearance of the deceased moving as if under the influence of alcohol and would have placed her at risk of falls, including down stairs
Multiple bruises and abrasions to the face, torso and limbs, majority over bony prominences could be accounted for by a number of falls. However, the possibility of inflicted injury cannot be excluded
The report concludes that a fall down the stairs followed by death at some point over the next few hours is entirely consistent with the observed injuries
Supplementary Report April 2022
The number and pattern of injuries observed were not sufficiently specific to conclude that the deceased was assaulted or forcibly restrained prior to her death
No typical defensive injuries identified
No old or healing fractures were identified, and so all of the observed fractures are likely to be represent recent trauma (i.e. fall or falls down stairs)
The report does not exclude the possibility of additional factors (e.g. an assault) having taken place but the pathological evidence does not contradict the witness account given
The additional report upholds the findings of the June 2021 report
Pathology voluntarily peer reviewed by Dr Hollingbury who supports the conclusions reached in the reports
The overall pattern of injuries was consistent with a fall or falls down the stairs”
The Police Report explained that:
“The police rationale for the decision not to make an agency DHR referral was that the death was not suspected to be as a result of violence, abuse or neglect
Whilst there is some limited domestic abuse history and the family have raised concerns about domestic abuse, as this is not deemed to be a suspected suicide, DA related controlling and coercive behaviour would not be relevant to any DHR identification
Therefore, based upon the evidence uncovered during the police investigation, the police position remains that the case does not meet the criteria for a DHR referral.”
Councillor Leigh Harper-Davies had been provided with additional information by AAFDA acting as advocate for CB’s family which supported the establishment of a DHR.
At its meeting on 1 December 2022 the CRG decided not to recommend to the CSP that a DHR be established. It was the view of the legal advisor to the CRG, Michael Oliver, that there was not enough substantive evidence of a causal link between the previous domestic incidents and CB’s death. The CRG agreed that the case did not meet the criteria for a DHR.
AAFDA then wrote to the chair of the QA Panel on 9 December 2022 explaining that they and the chair of the CSP were clear that the death met the criteria for a DHR because of the domestic abuse suffered by CB and “the suspicious circumstances of her death pointing to neglect.” They noted that the CPS (sic) (Footnote: 1) was not planning to inform the Home Office of the intention not to commission a DHR. Their understanding of the facts was a little different to that of the police and they set out 7 bullet points explaining why they considered CB’s death pointed to neglect following domestic abuse suffered:
“•  On two occasions police had been called to domestic abuse incidents with CB the victim.
•       CB’s father has accounts of the abusive behaviour:
Holding CB and her friend A hostage with a knife
Beating CB
Coercive control including limiting her spending, limiting her friends, being a nuisance at her place of work, even accompanying her to the hairdressers.
•  In the 999 call following CB’s death, her partner claimed that “she fell down the stairs multiple times”. He said she was still breathing, but the attending paramedic found her obviously deceased, cold with rigor-mortis setting in, her upper garments were around her neck, her lower garments around her ankles, there was dried blood on her mouth and nose.
•  The family is clear that in a vulnerable state, she was neglected and this led to her death.
•  A post-mortem found injuries including six broken ribs, lacerated liver, internal bleeding, damage to her neck, finger pad bruising to her jaw line and more.
•  Within hours of her death, the Police had decided it was an accidental death, without having full knowledge of the situation and ignoring conflicting witness statements.
•  Four months before her death, we know her partner beat her again, resulting in CB telling her father, her employer and others that she had had enough and was going to leave him. I am now aware she was in very severe debt, the family believe this was due to financial abuse. The consequences of this meant she could not rent her own accommodation, felt trapped so forced to move back in with her ex-partner.”
The letter from AAFDA to the QA Panel enclosed a statement from CB’s father which set out further incidents of abusive behaviour towards his daughter by M in addition to those reported to the police. Photographs of his daughter with visible injuries that her father said were caused by M were attached. CB’s father reported that the police had erroneously insisted the injuries were self-inflicted or as a result of a bump with a door frame. Instances of coercive and controlling behaviour such as M limiting CB’s spending, limiting her friends, being a nuisance at her place of work and accompanying her to the hairdressers were cited by CB’s father. He reported that four months before her death M beat CB again, resulting in CB telling her father, her employer and others that she had had enough and was going to leave him. Since her death CB’s father had learnt that she was in very severe debt but still appeared to have plans to move to friends in Portsmouth. M knew that she intended to leave him. Further details of the injuries in the pathologist’s report that were not included in the Police Report summary were provided by CB’s father in his statement attached to the AAFDA letter which were that her injuries “included six broken ribs, a lacerated liver, internal bleeding, damage to her neck, finger pad bruising to her jaw and more”.
The AAFDA letter also identified inconsistencies as between what M said in the 999 call and to the police and which sat uneasily with the evidence of the paramedics who attended that morning. In the 999 call M stated that CB was still breathing, but the paramedics found that she had been obviously deceased for two or more hours, rigor mortis was setting in and there was dried blood on her mouth and nose. Her upper garments were around her neck and her lower garments around her ankles. The letter made a number of criticisms of the police. (Footnote: 2)
Text or WhatsApp messages enclosed with the AAFDA letter provided by CB’s father were from September 2020 through to February 2021 in which CB describes problems she was experiencing in the relationship, for example of being undermined by M “I’m sick of being spoken to like a piece of shit, told I’m fucking useless and I’m losing my atse (sic) and I do his head in”. On another occasion she reports that she is told she is a “piece of crap” and that she is useless and worthless. She reports that her stepson, M’s son, is copying M’s behaviour towards her which upsets her and she needs to take a break from the house for her mental health. On 2020-October-30 she messages that M “smashed a glass last night and almost amputated my toe” and that she almost passed out the previous night. In early December 2020 she complains that she cannot do this much longer and is being constantly pulled down, that “every sentence he speaks there’s something in it to bring me down” but she is planning on seeing Christmas out for the sake of their son and would start making plans in the New Year as she is “suffering while M does as he pleases” and she “can’t keep being here”.
On 16 February 2021 CB texts her friend to say that she has told M that it is over and sends photographs of her face with injuries to her friend. Her friend replies telling her to pack her things and leave. Her friend asks if what M did was before or after CB had told him that she was leaving and the relationship was over, but the question is not answered. CB tells her friend that she had decided to stay that night to talk to M in person before he went away for a week to Germany, and she would go to her friend the next day. The friend makes plans to drop suitcases and boxes off the next day and for CB to pack everything that is hers surreptitiously and suggests CB calls women’s aid for advice if she thinks he will come after her. CB replies to say that she does not think he will and that he is now all sorry and asking if they can stay as friends. Her friend replies that there are no excuses for abuse and suggests that CB “take him to court for DV. You pull out your phone with recordings of him belittling and gas lighting you. You pull out photos of all the physical damage he’s done. What’s he going to say to the judge?… “She made me do it”?!” followed by emojis. CB replies “I don’t want court I just want to be happy.”
There was further discussion in the text exchanges about CB leaving, the logistics, arrangements for their child and pet rescue websites. While M was away CB packed all her clothes bar what was in the wardrobe and shoe cupboard on 18 February 2021. She then told her friend on 9 March 2021 that at his request she had agreed to give him one more chance, but that she would leave if he did not prove his worth.  The material from the AAFDA was not provided to the Minister himself. It is necessary to set out here since it was before the QA Panel and informed their advice to the Minister.
As a result of the AAFDA letter the Home Office began correspondence with the claimant.  The Home Office was informed on 5 January 2023 that the final decision of the CSP not to undertake a DHR was made on 1 December 2022. A draft DHR referral form was completed by the chair of the CSP panel which expressed concern that the case may meet the criteria within the s.9(1) definition and that there was an opportunity for lessons to be learnt from CB’s death, notwithstanding the conclusion and outcome of the police investigation and that no charges had been brought. The chair considered that there “appears” to be circumstances that may lead to the conclusion of domestic abuse, which would qualify for DHR. However, in section 2 of the form a DHR was not recommended since the chair had accepted the opinion of the other group members. The group accepted that there had been domestic incidents in the relationship between CB and M but there was no evidence to suggest a causal link between the past domestic incidents and the death of CB. The Police Report was attached at appendix A. As per the Police Report it was stated on the draft form that there had been numerous lines of enquiry into CB’s death and no criminal activity identified. This remained the view of the police after three investigations by SIOs and a peer review of the pathology report – there was no evidence to support murder or manslaughter offences or third party involvement. At no point since June 2021 had the police considered that the case met the DHR criteria. They considered that there was “no evidence to support a criminal act being committed and M had been treated as a witness throughout.” The pathology report also did not support that CB’s death was as a result of third party’s actions. The peer review supported the original decision not to arrest CB’s partner but to treat him as a witness.
“The investigation has been filed with no criminal offences being identified. Therefore, the death is not suspected. As this is not deemed to be a suspected suicide, DA related controlling and coercive behaviour would not be relevant to any DHR identification. Therefore, based upon the evidence uncovered during the police investigation the case does not meet the criteria for a DHR referral.”
Further information was sought by the Home Office and the CSP then completed and submitted the correct template subsequently provided by the Home Office explaining the rationale for its decision not to conduct a DHR. It set out the facts as they understood them to be and concluded as follows:
“There are past domestic incidents in the relationship between [CB] and [M], (the most recent alleged incident occurring in February 2021. There is no evidence to suggest any causal link between the past domestic incidents and the death of [CB] which at this stage is believed to be accidental, subject to the Coroner’s findings. In light of this currently there is no information or evidence to support the proposition that the death “has or appears to have” resulted from violence, abuse or neglect.
Therefore based on the current information available applied to the statutory criteria for a DHR no Homicide has occurred and therefore no grounds to undertake a domestic homicide review despite the tragic circumstances resulting in [CB]’s death”
The death was believed to be accidental.
The Home Office QA Panel considered the case via email exchanges between 23 January 2023 and 1 February 2023 and on 6 February 2023 the Home Office Interpersonal Abuse Unit (“IAU”), which had been in correspondence with the CRG, informed the CRG that the QA panel considered the case “would benefit from a DHR.”
An inquest into CB’s death was conducted on 20 February 2023 by HM assistant coroner Miss S Evans which concluded that CB’s death was an “accidental death” and found that M was unaware that CB had injured herself before he had helped her into bed.
There was a further exchange of correspondence between the CRG/CSP and IAU. The CRG again concluded that the criteria for a DHR were not met and the CSP accepted the recommendation not to establish a DHR.
The Home Office was informed and the Minister was provided with a written submission from Home Office officials recommending that a DHR should be directed dated 5 July 2023 (“the Submission”). The Submission accurately set out the statutory framework and the Secretary of State’s powers, delegated to the Minister, to direct a DHR, described the make-up of the QA Panel and their recommendation that the Minister direct the CSP to conduct a DHR. Annex A to the Submission set out the advice of the QA Panel and recommendations. It accurately summarised the case provided by the CSP and its reasons for deciding not to conduct a DHR which was that it considered that there was no evidence to suggest a causal link between past domestic incidents and CB’s death. It set out that the family had provided the Home Office with additional information (a reference to the AAFDA letter and enclosures described above) and the family’s belief that CB was in a vulnerable state and neglected which led to her death. The family had provided information on specific incidents of domestic abuse including disclosures to her employer that she was planning to end the relationship with M.
The QA Panel’s advice was that the case would benefit from a DHR on the basis that there were a number of abuse incidents between CB and M between 2007 – 2020 involving assault and threatening behaviour with a knife/holding her hostage. The injuries sustained and the pathology report finding that states that the possibility of inflicted injury could not be excluded and screenshots of messages shared by the family with the QA Panel show CB’s intention to leave, patterns of coercive and controlling behaviours and disclosures of domestic abuse to friends.
The QA Panel had also noted that there was little information relating to other services included in the submission other than police information. The QA Panel had recommended engaging health services, CB’s employer, her child’s school and that friends and family should all inform the decision to commission a DHR. The CSP continued to disagree that a DHR was necessary. The advice was that the civil servants were clear that the statutory criteria for a DHR had been satisfied and furthermore, the recommendation was based on the advice of the expert QA Panel.  The Minister also received the DHR criteria in Annex B to the Submission and a draft letter in case he was minded to follow the recommendation.
The Minister accepted the recommendation and issued his Decision in a direction to the claimant under s.9(2) of the 2004 Act:
“The decision has been reviewed and I am not satisfied with the conclusions reached by Charnwood Community Safety Partnership (CSP) that there are no lessons to be learned from this tragic death.
Under section 9(1) of the Domestic Violence, Crime and Victims Act 2004 (DVCVA), a DHR is a review of the circumstances in which the death of a person aged 16 or over has, or appears to have, resulted from violence, abuse or neglect by— (a) a person to whom he was related or with whom he was or had been in an intimate personal relationship, or (b) a member of the same household as himself, and this. review is held with a view to identifying the lessons to be learned from the death. Furthermore, the statutory guidance issued under s.9(3) of the DVCVA 2004, to which you and other bodies in the CSP or involved in the DHR must have regard to, clearly states several purposes for conducting DHRs, including to:
Prevent domestic violence and homicide and improve service responses for all domestic violence and abuse victims and their children by developing a co-ordinated multi-agency approach to ensure that domestic abuse is identified and responded to effectively at the earliest opportunity
Contribute to a better understanding of the nature of domestic violence and abuse
The CSP have focused their decision not to conduct a review on the basis that there is no evidence to suggest a causal link between the past domestic incidents involving CB and M and the death of CB. Furthermore, as the coroner recorded the death as accidental, the CSP believe it does not appear from the evidence available that the case meets the criteria for a DHR.
However, DHRs offer a rare opportunity to understand the victim's life and it would be pertinent to conduct a review to examine the circumstances which led to this death and ensure lessons are learned. There were multiple domestic abuse incidents between CB and M between 2007 and 2020, involving assault as well as threatening behaviour with a knife and holding her hostage. As part of these incidents, there are several factors which could be examined including the injuries. sustained, the pathology report which states the possibility of inflicted injury, the screenshots of messages showing CB's intention to leave M the patterns of coercive and controlling behaviours, and the disclosure of domestic abuse to friends.
That is why under section 9(2) of the DVCVA 2004 (powers delegated to me by the Home Secretary) I am directing Charnwood Borough Council, as the body within section 9(4) of the 2004 Act with lead responsibility in the Community Safety Partnership for DHRs, to establish a DHR.”
The Deputy Chief Executive of the claimant wrote to the Minister on 8 August 2023 asking him to review his decision, pointing out that it had not seen the letter from the AAFDA and reiterating the claimant’s view that the statutory criteria were not made out to enable the Minister to direct them to conduct a DHR and asked for their letter to be shared with the QA Panel and for their reasons for considering that the statutory test had been met. No substantive response was received before the claimant’s pre-action protocol letter before action was sent on 25 September 2023 which was in similar terms to the letter of 8 August 2023.
The QA panel reconsidered CB’s case remotely on 27 September 2023 after an exchange of emails from 21 -27 September 2023. They were not provided with the letter before claim before their meeting, but they had the claimant’s letter of 8 August 2023 and a full recital of the coroner’s findings. The case was fully discussed and the various participants shared their views. All but one of the participants who spoke considered that the DHR criteria had been met and that a DHR should be conducted. In her witness statement in defence of the proceedings the head of Domestic Abuse Perpetrator and Homicide Policy within the IAU, Ms Patel explains that the QA panel position did not change, but they added that the death also met the criteria for a DHR on the basis that it could appear to be attributed to neglect given that the deceased was put to bed after falling down the stairs multiple times and sustaining fatal injuries.
In its PAP response of 9 October 2023 the defendant resisted the proposed judicial review in the following terms:
The SSHD retains a broad discretion to order a DHR. The statutory guidance on conducting DHRs states:
DHRs are not inquiries into how the victim died or into who is culpable; that is a matter for coroners and criminal courts, respectively, to determine as appropriate. DHRs are not specifically part of any disciplinary inquiry or process. Where information emerges in the course of a DHR indicating that disciplinary action should be initiated, the established agency disciplinary procedures should be undertaken separately to the DHR process. Alternatively, some DHRs may be conducted concurrently with (but separate to) disciplinary action.
The letter [a reference to the pre-action protocol letter sent by the claimant] seems to suggest that the conclusions of the coroner and police are the end of the matter. That is a misreading of the breadth of the discretion and the purpose of a DHR. The police look at potential criminal liability and the coroner looks at the reasons that that individual died. The DHR is an additional process to examine what has gone before including dealing with multi-agency evidence to see if there are any lessons that can be learnt as per section 9(1) of the Act. Therefore, whilst the coroner’s inquest and police investigation will be of considerable assistance to the DHR, they are not determinative of the examination of the facts or any findings as to lessons learnt.
The letter seems to challenge that the SSHD has given a broad interpretation to “or appears to have, resulted from violence abuse or neglect” (emphasis added). There are several interpretations of the facts that could be examined, that is a matter for the DHR to examine in the round. All that is required is that the death ‘appears to have resulted from neglect’. The facts surrounding the death, including the failure to call for medical assistance in a timely manner, can have that interpretation.
There is on any view of the facts, circumstances that suggest that the death could appear to have resulted from neglect.
The Council also argues that in effect because the coroner has already examined the case and concluded accidental death that is the end of the matter. That is to introduce a condition precedent that a DHR can only be implemented if the coroner approves. That is the antithesis of the legislation. Its purpose is to add an additional layer of scrutiny.
The statutory criteria are therefore met in this case.
The SSHD therefore maintains the direction to establish a DHR.”
In the PAP response the Secretary of State hoped that the matter could be resolved without litigation and explained that she was willing to consider ADR, or further discussions with the claimant regarding the factual circumstances of the death, if it would be helpful. The claimant did not take her up on the offer and proceedings then ensued.
The above is a brief outline of the chronology of events. Much of the documentation in the bundle focused on the claimant’s decision not to establish a DHR, but it is important to bear in mind that it is the defendant’s Decision to direct the claimant to establish a DHR that is under challenge in this case. The claimant does not have to justify its decision not to establish a DHR. The claimant’s reasons for deciding not to do so are relevant only to the extent that they challenge and test the Minister’s Decision. Neither the CSP, the defendant nor the QA Panel had the evidence gathered by the police in their investigation: they did not have the witness statements, the CCTV or the pathology report itself and none of those documents were in the bundle before me. Although minutes from the CRG meetings when the matter was discussed, a transcript of the 999 call and an extract from a note by the SIO DI Markham were put in evidence before this court, these documents were not before the defendant when the Decision was made. However I note that the 999 call is corroborative of the points made by the AAFDA about the inconsistencies in M’s account about the circumstances and timing of CB’s death to the police on the one hand and the information he provided in the 999 call on the other.
The QA Panel considered CB’s case by email before the Minister’s Decision. The QA Panel did not discuss the matter in person because the Home Office had been asked for a rapid decision before the coroner’s inquest. All but one of those on the QA Panel who responded to the email request for their views on what recommendation to make to the Minister considered that a DHR should be conducted. The documents before them were the CSP’s decision not to conduct template form, the CRG‘s completed DHR referral form, the Police Report and the additional information given by the deceased’s family in the letter of 9 December 2022 from AAFDA and the messages and statement enclosed with it.
Parties’ submissions
The claimant
The claimant submitted as a preliminary point that the Minister’s actual reasons in the Decision letter were not the same as those now relied on. The parties were agreed that it is the lawfulness of the Minister’s Decision which must be assessed and that if the reasons advanced in the course of proceedings had changed from the reasons given in the Decision then the later, different explanation must be ignored (see, e.g., R (Bancoult) v Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs [2007] EWCA Civ 990, [2008] QB 365 at [70]). The claimant’s submission was that the further correspondence and explanation was not a mere expansion of the earlier reason but an ex post facto rationalisation which a court should be astute to spot (Caroopen v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2016] EWCA Civ 1307, [2017] 1 WLR 2339, per Underhill LJ at [30]-[31]). By now suggesting that the Minister’s basis for the Decision was neglect of CB by M, which had not previously been mentioned in the Decision, represented a fundamental change. The court should disregard the explanation of the decision to direct the claimant to establish a DHR set out in the defendant’s PAP response and statement of case.
In ground one, the claimant submitted that on a correct interpretation CB’s death did not result, or did not appear to have resulted, from violence, abuse or neglect and without the presence of that necessary element the defendant had no power to direct the claimant to establish a DHR. There is no case law that interprets s.9 and the Guidance did not address the question. In any event the Guidance could not be relied upon as an aid to its interpretation (cf. R (CXF) v Central Bedfordshire Council [2018] EWCA Civ 2852, [2019] 1 WLR 1862, per Leggatt LJ at [24]-[25]) since it was prepared 12 years after the enactment of the 2004 Act. Even if it had been contemporaneous, it would not be binding as to the meaning of the statute.
It was submitted that words “resulted from” clearly imports a requirement of causal connection between the death and the relevant violence, abuse or neglect - the death must be the effect of one of those. Relying on the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary (2007), Vol.2, p.2554 the definition of the verb “result” is “(1) Arise as an effect, issue or outcome from some action, process or design…”. In Rothwell v Caverswall Stone Co Ltd [1944] 2 All ER 350, per du Pacq LJ at 365, “result from” was interpreted (in the Workmen’s Compensation Act 1925, s.9) as “follows from, and is caused by …”.
It was said that for a death to have “resulted from” the relevant violence, abuse or neglect means that, on the balance of probabilities, the death resulted from one of those.
As to the word “appear”, it is defined in the Shorter OED, Vol.1, p.101, as, inter alia: “(5) Be clear or evident to the understanding, be manifest… (6) … Seem to the mind, be perceived as, be considered…”. Section 9(1) does not specify that the death “appear” to a particular person or body (e.g., a person or body specified in s.9(4) or to the Secretary of State) to have so resulted. That indicates that the test is objective.
In R v Dickens [1990] 2 QB 102, CA, Lord Lane CJ at 107b-c held that “appears to the court” required prima facie evidence. In the present statutory context, it was submitted by the claimant that the degree of probability required to attach to the “appears to have resulted” limb may be less than for the “has resulted” limb, but there has to be prima facie evidence that objectively warrants the view that the death resulted from the relevant violence, abuse or neglect - mere suspicion or grounds to suspect would not suffice.
There must be a causal connection based on prima facie evidence between any past violence, abuse or neglect by a person such as M and the death that objectively warrants such an appearance. The information before the Minister did not provide such a basis and in the absence of any prima facie evidence to establish such a link the Minister had no power to make the direction.
On ground two –  misdirection/irrationality public law error allegations - the claimant argued that the Minister had failed to address the coroner’s verdict (ground 2(a)); was irrational at worst, or at best failed to explain how could conclude there had been “multiple domestic abuse incidents” when the police had only recorded two previous incidents (ground 2(b)); the Minister’s reliance on the pathology report as identifying “the possibility of inflicted injury” demonstrated a material misunderstanding of the pathologist’s findings and cherry picking. The fact the pathologist could not exclude the possibility of inflicted injuries as the cause of death was insufficient to conclude that the death appeared to have resulted from such inflicted injuries (ground 2(c)); it was too great a leap to rely on the limited recorded previous incidents of violence or abuse to conclude that the death appeared to have resulted from such violence or abuse as it was insufficient to establish the causal link (see ground one) (ground 2(d)); and, finally, reliance on controlling behaviour was misplaced since the Guidance cites coercive and controlling behaviour as relevant only if suicide is being considered, but there is no suggestion in this case that CB killed herself (ground 2(e)).
Overall the Minister made no attempt to grapple with the reasons given by the Police or the CRG/CSP as to why CB’s death was not considered to be a death that resulted from, or appeared to have resulted from, violence, abuse or neglect, at all and as to why the matters which he cites (and which they had considered) were not seen as establishing that the s.9(1) criteria were met.
Ground three, arises only if the claimant is unsuccessful in its preliminary point and the Court accepts that neglect formed part of the Minister’s reasons for his Decision and challenges the reasons given in the statement of case and PAP response on traditional public law grounds. Firstly it was submitted that the Minister applied the wrong threshold for probability, stating that the death could appear to have resulted from neglect which is not the same as it actually appearing to be so (ground 3(a)).
There is no consideration as to why M would or should have appreciated CB’s medical needs at the point when they both went to bed in the early hours of 5 June 2021 after they had both been drinking heavily. The coroner specifically found that M was unaware that CB had injured herself and no explanation is given as to how or why a contrary conclusion is reached. Nor is the issue as to whether M was under a duty to obtain medical treatment for CB at that point discussed or addressed (ground 3(b)).
Thirdly, there was a misdirection as to the nature of neglect as a one-off default in obtaining medical treatment for an adult lasting, at most, a few hours. While “neglect” is not defined in the 2004 Act, the Explanatory Notes to the Act or the Guidance, in the statutory context of s.9 it should be interpreted in the same way as “neglect” in other statutory contexts as concerned with more than a one-off neglect of duty and instead requiring continuous or non-transient neglect (e.g. in respect of coronial practice in finding a death results from neglect, see R v HM Coroner for North Humberside and Scunthorpe, ex p Johnson [1995] QB 1, per Sir Thomas Bingham MR at 25; in respect of child protection, see the statutory guidance, Working Together to Safeguard Children 2023 (definition of “Neglect” at p.160)) (Ground 3(c)).
Finally, even if neglect could be established, the Minister had no evidence on which to base a conclusion that CB’s death appeared to have resulted from such neglect. The Claimant is aware of no evidence as to whether delay in seeking medical treatment caused or contributed in any way to CB’s death. The conclusions were highly speculative.
Defendant’s submissions
The defendant’s position was straightforward. There was careful consideration of all the available evidence sufficient for the Minister to conclude that the death of CB appeared to have resulted from neglect by her partner which satisfied the low threshold set out in the statute to entitle the Minister to exercise his delegated responsibility to direct the CSP to establish a DHR to see if lessons could be learnt. The conclusions of the coroner and the police are not an end to the matter. The defendant does not suggest that this was a homicide.  CB might have survived had she got medical help rather than being put to bed – because she is now dead it is impossible to know for certain, but the DHR may cast light on additional support that might have meant that her partner or social services could or should have had more input and support, or identify if there might have been other signs that were missed. GP records or social services or housing records may shed further light. The claimant has taken a deliberately narrow interpretation to a complex and multi-faceted issue and applied too high an evidential threshold.
There were no public law errors that vitiated the Minister’s decision. In answer to the third ground of appeal, the reasons set out in the PAP response letter on which the defendant now relies are not different to the earlier reasons set out in correspondence, but merely more detailed and precise. Mr Keith accepted that if the Minister’s reasons at the time had changed they could not be changed after the event, but there was now merely greater specificity, not substantive change.
Analysis and conclusions
Before the defendant can require a relevant body to establish a DHR, five elements must be satisfied. In issue in this case is only whether the death had, or appeared to have, resulted from violence, abuse or neglect from M. All other elements were satisfied: CB was over 16, she was in an intimate personal relationship with M, the review was to consider the circumstances of her death with the purpose of identifying lessons that could be learnt.
Are the reasons advanced in these proceedings different to the Minister’s Decision and, if so, with what consequence?
Mr Keith accepted in general terms that a decision-maker who gives one set of reasons cannot, when challenged, come up with another set – as per the reference in the claimant’s submissions to Bancoult at paragraph [70] – but it is worth spending a little time on what amounts to a different set of reasons. Sedley LJ cites R v Westminster City Council, ex p Ermakov [1996] 2 All ER 302 as the source for his proposition in [70] of Bancoult. In Ermakov “fundamentally different” reasons “of the greatest significance” for why the defendant local authority had decided that Mr Ermakov and his family were intentionally homeless and refused them accommodation were put forward in the decision letter to those advanced in the defendant’s evidence and in its defence of the claim. The evidence of the decision maker, Mr Lodge,  evidence was that the decision letter and note taken by the homelessness officer inaccurately recorded his reasons. The issue in the case was whether it was reasonable for the Ermakov family to live in their home in Greece and were therefore intentionally homeless. The decision letter, compiled by a junior member of staff purportedly recording Mr Lodge’s decision, said that the authority was not satisfied that the family had experienced harassment in their home in Greece and therefore it was reasonable for them to have stayed there. However, Mr Lodge’s evidence sought to be put forward by the defendant contradicted the reason given in the decision letter – he said that he had accepted that the Ermakovs’ account of harassment, but he had decided that the harassment described did not justify the family moving out of their house in Greece to live in London. As Hutchison LJ noted that “It is difficult to imagine a starker contrast” between the two sets of reasons and the reasons given in the letter were not the true reasons. In other places in the Court of Appeal’s judgment the actual reasons given by Mr Lodge were described as entirely new, completely at odds with those given in the decision letter.
There were a number of factors of special importance that guided the court’s decision: firstly that the Council’s obligation to give reasons for refusing to house the Ermakov family was statutory; secondly the fact that entirely new reasons were put forward; and thirdly the idea that material gaps in reasons can always be supplemented ex post facto by affidavit or otherwise ought not to be encouraged. Relying on R. v. London Borough of Croydon, ex p. Graham (1993) 26 H.L.R. 286 per Sir Thomas Bingham M.R. consistent with a number of other first instance decisions, two further propositions were formulated:     (1)  If the reasons given are insufficient to enable the court to consider the lawfulness of the decision, the decision itself will be unlawful; and  (2)  The court should, at the very least, be circumspect about allowing material gaps to be filled by affidavit evidence or otherwise.
It is important to note that in this case, unlike in Bancoult, there was no statutory obligation on the defendant to issue reasons with the decision.
The other case relied on by Mr Cornwell, Caroopen, also repays close attention. In it Underhill LJ reminds us at [48] that it is important to pay close attention to the kind of subsequent letter or decision with potentially different reasoning to those set out in an initial decision, in any particular case. Underhill LJ was also careful to note that in the decisions under appeal in Caroopen the defendant was not under a statutory obligation to provide reasons with its decision.  He identifies four conceptually different types of purpose that a supplementary letter may serve: firstly further reasons cases where there is no explicit statutory duty to give reasons when courts should still approach attempts to rely on subsequently provided reasons with caution, especially where important human rights are concerned; secondly a supplementary letter which may be effective, not by retrospectively curing the original decision, but by prospectively filling the gap which would arise if the original decision were to be held to be invalid, which certainly in the Upper Tribunal of the Immigration and Asylum Chamber may be relevant to the relief granted (if any); thirdly a “new material” case where new material requires a decision maker to reconsider their original decision; and fourthly where the decision maker acknowledges the original decision is wrong, effectively makes a fresh decision superseding the original decision where the tribunal has to decide whether to allow the validity of the fresh decision to be determined in the context of the existing proceedings ([30]-[33]).
I now return to the contents of the Decision and the PAP response to apply the legal principles to the facts of this case. In the Decision the Minister accurately set out the statutory test and the criteria giving him the power that has been delegated to him by the Secretary of State to direct the claimant to establish a DHR – that the death has, or appears to have resulted from violence, abuse or neglect, by, in this case, M. The letter does not expressly state that CB’s death was or appeared to have been caused by M. Nor does it identify which of the three possible matters – violence, abuse or neglect - had, or appeared to have resulted in her death, but cites the multiple domestic abuse incidents, possibility of inflicted injury, screenshot messages showing CB’s intention to leave, patterns of coercive and controlling behaviour and disclosure of domestic abuse to friends. However the Submission from the QA Panel  states that the AAFDA believe from the additional information that they had obtained that CB was in a vulnerable state and neglected which led to her death and referred to the specific information of specific incident of domestic abuse, including disclosures to her employer and that CB had stated she was planning to end the relationship. It also identifies the claimant’s objection to a DHR on the ground that there was no evidence to suggest a causal link between past domestic incidents and CB’s death on 5 June 2021. It goes on to say that it would be pertinent to conduct a review to understand CB’s life and examine the circumstances which led to her death to ensure that lessons can be learnt.
In the PAP response letter, challenging what the defendant considers to be the claimant’s too narrow view of the legislation that the conclusions of the coroner and the police are the end of the matter, it states
“All that is required is that the death appears to have resulted from neglect. The facts surrounding the death, including the failure to call for medical assistance in a timely manner, can have that interpretation. There is on any view of the facts, circumstances that suggest that the death could appear to have resulted from neglect.”
On the face of it, the reasons in the PAP response letter are not different to those in the Decision letter, but a more precise, refinement of the earlier reasons. In reaching my conclusion that the reasons are not different per se, I have taken into account the wording of Ms Patel’s statement that the QA Panel after its September 2023 meeting “also” considered the death could be attributable to neglect, but I interpret this as mere infelicitous wording, not a different set of reasons. The AAFDA view had always been that it appeared that M’s neglect of CB was the cause of her death as explained in their careful letter. Neglect is also identified in the Submission to the Minister by the QA Panel. The fact that the Minister highlights some of the previous domestic abuse incidents and other matters in the Decision in explanation of his direction is not inconsistent with CB’s death having resulted from neglect by M. As the Submission accurately summarised the AAFDA position – there was a history of domestic violence in line with para 15 of the Guidance, CB was in a vulnerable state and neglected. The further reasons do not contradict the earlier ones. So I conclude that since it is not different, the PAP response letter may be relied on in this litigation as further explanation of the Minister’s reasons for his decision and do not amount to prohibited ex post facto rationalisation.
But if I am wrong about that and the failure in the Decision letter to mention the neglect referred to in the PAP response amounts to a material difference of some sorts between the two documents, let us consider the consequences. It would fall into category one of Underhill LJ’s categories and the further reasons should be approached with caution. This is an entirely different case to Ermakov where the actual decision maker, Mr Lodge, said that the reasons given in the reasons letter by the more junior member of staff were plain wrong and Mr Lodge’s reasons had been entirely different to those given. Here, the PAP response letter, if it is different at all, does not contradict the Decision. The human rights of the claimant are not engaged and the Minister was not under a statutory duty to give reasons (unlike in Caroopen).  Even on the most cautious of approaches the reasons in the PAP response letter do not constitute an impermissible ex post facto rationalisation and may be relied on in defence of these proceedings.
Ground one
Ground 1 is that on a natural reading of the Minster’s decision, he implicitly misdirected himself in law that it was sufficient for a DHR to be established if there were lessons to be learnt from a death, without any express finding that the death appeared to have resulted from domestic violence, abuse or neglect. I have noted above, that the Decision does not, in terms, state that it appears that CB’s death was caused by M’s violence, neglect or abuse. Mr Cornwell also made much play of what he said was the somewhat speculative wording in the PAP response letter that the facts surrounding the death, including that the failure to call for medical assistance in a timely manner, could appear to have resulted from neglect. His criticism was the use of  the word “could” have resulted in her death, rather than “did” or “appeared to have” done so.
But I read the letter and the PAP response differently. The Decision accurately cites and sets out the statutory test of whether the death has or appears to have, resulted from violence, abuse or neglect by, inter alia, a person with whom CB had been in an intimate personal relationship and the purpose of conducting a DHR.
It is implicit from a balanced reading of the Decision and PAP response that the Minister had a clear understanding from accurately citing the legislation that he was both aware that he could only direct a DHR if CB’s death had, or appeared to have, resulted from violence, abuse or neglect of her by M. It goes without saying from his recitation of the statutory test that CB’s death was in scope and he then quite properly went on to consider whether to exercise his discretion to direct a DHR and if lessons could be learned from it, and he concluded that they could.   Self-evidently the Decision/PAP response is not predicated on the actual fact of a causal link between M and CB’s death given the outcome of the police investigation and the coroner’s report. The Minister correctly understood that that was not the end of the matter and he could consider the appearance of CB’s death.
So far, so good, but what is a death which “has, or appears to have, resulted from violence, abuse or neglect” by a relation, or a person with whom they had been in an intimate personal relationship, or a member of the same household (s.9(1) of the 2004 Act)? In its challenge, the claimant focused on the meaning of the words “appear”, “resulted from” and “neglect”.
It was agreed that the evidential threshold for an appearance is lower than a balance of probabilities test. The OED  definition is appropriate as it is an ordinary word with a natural meaning: “seem to the mind, be perceived as, be considered”. Little, if any, benefit is derived from trying to define it further and the parties did not seek to argue otherwise. As for “result from”, here there was a clear distinction between the parties’ respective positions. For the claimant it was said that the violence, abuse or neglect must be the primary and direct cause of death whereas the defendant submitted that the wording was deliberately open textured and although there must be a direct cause, it need not be the sole cause. Some time was also spent in the hearing on the meaning of “neglect” in s.9(1). The claimant submitted that a one off failure to call 999 was not capable of amounting to neglect, although Mr Cornwell accepted that the threshold was not as high as for gross negligence manslaughter. Mr Keith suggested the ordinary civil meaning of the word applied. Both agreed there must appear to be a causal connection between the violence, abuse or neglect and the death.
I find that the section is deliberately open textured, using non-legalistic language, and requires a low evidential threshold, below a balance of probabilities test. “Looks like” is a useful synonym for “appears”. Again, it is not a fruitful exercise to try to define it further. I agree it must be an objective test. The appearance will be based on the information known to the decision maker, which may include inferences to be drawn from any gaps in the information.
For something to result from something else there must be a causal connection, but I do not find that it must be the primary or sole cause. A looser connection, a material or sufficient contribution is sufficient. The defendant conceded that there must be a direct cause, but the suicide example in the Guidance would suggest that the term may bear a wider interpretation, but on the facts before me and in light of the defendant’s concession, it does not require a determination in this case. I have proceeded on the basis of the parties’ agreed position.
I find that the word neglect in s.9(1) bears its natural and ordinary meaning, which is the fact of not giving enough care or attention to something or somebody. Nothing more technical or sophisticated is required. It is not to be confused with the term gross negligence manslaughter and as the Guidance emphasises, DHRs are not about who is culpable or how a victim died (para 11) so definitions from the criminal law are not helpful.
I also reject the claimant’s submission that one incident would never be sufficient to amount to neglect. Again a non-technical, commonsense approach to the language is called for. It is worth remembering that the purpose of the legislation is to learn lessons to prevent future deaths that have or appear to have resulted from violence, abuse or neglect by intimate partners (and specified others). The Guidance explains the meaning of domestic violence in paragraph 15.
Applying that definition to the information before the Minister, based on the Submissions from the QA Panel, a specialist panel with particular expertise from a wide range of sources in the field of domestic abuse, he was entitled to conclude that, as identified by the family, it appeared that CB’s death resulted from M’s neglect of her. She was in a vulnerable state and neglected when she fell down the stairs several times fatally injuring herself and M failed to get help. This was against a troubling background of specific incidents of domestic abuse and her plans to end the relationship which would have made her especially at risk.
True it is that it would have been preferable if the Minister’s Decision letter had expressly stated that CB’s death appeared to have resulted from M’s violence, abuse or neglect and specifically referred to the incidents of his neglect of her and his failure to call for help for her after she had kept falling down the stairs on their return that night. But that was not necessary when it was implicit from the letter and the defendant was writing to the CRG which was also familiar with the statutory test and there was no statutory duty to provide reasons. But the further reasons in the PAP response letter spell it out more precisely and there is no error of law or misdirection in law as to the causal link. Ground 1 is dismissed. There appeared to be a causal link between M’s neglect of CB over the night of 4-5 June 2021 which resulted in her death as identified by the QA Panel in its Submission which the Minister accepted. Furthermore, the underlying material on which the QA Panel submission was based from the AAFDA, amply justified the conclusion that CB’s death appeared to have resulted from M’s neglect of her culminating in her death that night.
Ground 2
Since I have found against the claimant on the preliminary point, the criticisms of the initial Decision letter can be dealt with briefly. There are a number of specific overlapping points raised in the allegations of traditional public law errors in the decision. Before diving into the detail a few general points are worth making. The nature of the decision under challenge is a direction to a council to conduct a DHR. It is not a determination of civil rights but involves conducting a multi-agency review and paying for an independent chair and the parties were agreed that the direct costs were approximately £10,000 although there would be the indirect costs of the police and others’ time and work.
It is important to bear in mind the purpose and context in which a decision on directing a DHR is made as set out above. A DHR may be conducted on the basis of appearances, if there is a proper basis for that appearance and cases which do not result in criminal convictions or civil proceedings may be in scope.
I now turn to each of the specific points raised by the claimant. In 2(a) the defendant is criticised for not explaining how the coroner’s verdict of accidental death can be squared with CB’s death appearing to have resulted from violence, abuse or neglect of her by M. But the Guidance states that the DHR is not a re-run of the coronial process and it is not inconsistent for a coroner’s verdict to be accidental death and yet there still be an appearance that the death resulted from another’s violence, abuse or neglect. The law was drafted intentionally to enable reviews into deaths such as CB’s with the appearance of having resulted from neglect from a relevant other to be reviewed. It is not a criminal or coronial investigation. The coroner’s verdict that the death was accidental is not impugned by the establishment of a DHR. The defendant did not need to spell all that out to the claimant in the Decision letter.
In ground 2(b) the Minister is criticised for concluding that there had been multiple abuse incidents, when the police had only two filed reports of domestic abuse. There are two problems with the claimant’s argument. Firstly as confirmed in the PAP response the defendant relies only on neglect and the past domestic abuse incidents are therefore only relevant background and context. Secondly, in any event, the Minister was entitled to conclude that there appeared to have been incidents of domestic abuse as reported by CB to her family, friends and her employer which had escalated in the months leading up to her death.
Grounds 2(c) and (d) fall away with my conclusion on the preliminary point that the defendant may rely on the PAP response and the reasons set out in that letter. The defendant is not relying on CB’s death resulting from domestic violence by M in the early hours of 5 June 2021. It is not suggested by the defendant that M assaulted CB and caused the abdominal injuries from which she died, but that is not the question that the Minister was required to ask himself in deciding whether to direct the claimant to establish a DHR.
Ground 2 (e) also falls away in light of my conclusion on the preliminary point. However it is not clear to me that para 18 of the Guidance bears the meaning suggested by the claimant. Whilst paragraph 18 refers specifically to suicides,  it is an example of the breadth of the scope of the meaning of s.9(1) and when a DHR may be appropriate and support the defendant’s arguments in ground 1, supported by the definition of domestic abuse as defined in para 15.
I find that the Minister did not need to grapple any more than he did with the reasons given by the police or pathologist as to why CB’s death was not considered to be a homicide at all. He was not looking at the matter as a review of the police charging decision. He was not looking at culpability but applying the statutory test in s.9(1). Although CB’s family were raising issues about the adequacy of the police inquiry and the evidential leads that they considered had not been explored, it was not necessary, or even desirable, for the Minister to engage with those criticisms in his Decision. His Decision fell into two parts: were the s.9(1) criteria met, and if so, should he exercise his discretion to direct a DHR so that lessons could be learnt. He is neither himself conducting a criminal enquiry or deciding if the police failed in theirs. A DHR, if established, may in appropriate cases consider best practice in policing and if there are lessons to be learnt in future cases, but that was not part of the defendant’s remit or his decision making at this stage. He was looking at the summary of the police report and the summary of the family’s concerns to make his decision set out in the Submission and was not required to say more than he did. Given his conclusion on the first part of the question it goes without saying that lessons could be learnt from a DHR in this case.
Ground 2 is dismissed.
Ground 3
Ground 3 challenges the reasons in the PAP response. Once again a few general preliminary observations are necessary. This was a case with a number of red flags. CB lived in a relationship in which there was some evidence that she had been subject to domestic violence in the past, including reports to the police. There was evidence of injuries sustained three and a half months earlier and photographs of CB with a black eye from which it could reasonably be inferred from contemporaneous text and WhatsApp messages had been caused by M, and accounts in her messages to friends and family consistent with controlling and coercive behaviour by M. There was also information that CB wanted to leave M which it is well recognised would make her more vulnerable. There was some evidence of financial abuse. The QA Panel is made up of specialists in the field of domestic abuse who had considered the information that they had received extremely carefully and the Minister had been appropriately briefed in the Submission.
Turning to the specific grounds. I reject the claimant’s linguistic analysis and parsing of the use of the word “could” in the PAP response. It is nit picking. It is obvious that the PAP response uses the word “could” to explain how it is that it appears that CB’s failure to get medical help for CB would on its own amount to neglect causing her death. It does not mean that the Minister had failed to make a decision about how her death appeared, as is obvious from the context. It is used to assist the claimant to understand the scope of the section and to correct the misconception that appears in some of the documents that a domestic homicide was required. The point the letter is trying to make is that the use of the word homicide in s.9 is subject to its own definition which is much wider and more expansive than the word might otherwise suggest. It is interesting to note that the Home Office is updating the legislation and replacing the term “domestic homicide review” with Domestic Abuse Related Death Review to avoid exactly the sort of confusion that arose in this case. The defendant’s invitation to the claimant in the PAP response to work with it to gain a better understanding of the facts around CB’s death was a genuine attempt to assist them.
Grounds 3(b), (c) and (d) apply too stringent a test to the defendant’s decision- making exercise, bearing in mind it was based on appearances. At the risk of repetition, as noted above, the Minister was not required to conduct a full investigation and reach conclusions before directing a DHR. The submission misunderstands the purpose of a DHR. The point is that M went home with CB knowing that she drunk to the point of having trouble staying upright. Her friend was so concerned about her she rang twice in 4 minutes and could hear CB sounding upset in the background. The noise of her falling down the stairs was so loud that it woke up the next door neighbours. The injuries she suffered repeatedly falling down the stairs were so serious that they killed her. There was a background of earlier abuse, reports of gaslighting behaviour and CB’s deteriorating low self-esteem in the months before her death and M had failed to summon any help that night. He made a surprising comment to the paramedics about her weight.
Against the limited information available of the history of CB and M’s relationship and the account of what happened on the night of CB’s death, there was sufficient information for the Minister to conclude, and it was perfectly reasonable and rational for him to decide that it appeared that neglect by M resulted in her death. Medical treatment may or may not have saved CB, but the Minister did not need to consider medical evidence on causation along the lines of a clinical negligence trial to make the decision that he did. It is interesting to note that the Home Office suggested at an early stage to the claimant that they could consider obtaining wider information prior to deciding whether to establish a DHR, but they chose not to do so. They also chose not to take the Home Office up on their similar offer in the PAP response. If those steps had been taken they may have provided a clearer picture that would have supported the claimant’s position.
I have disregarded the information that the Minister did not have before him. Had he known of the discrepancies in M’s witness statement with the 999 call and the paramedic evidence from which inferences could have been drawn he would no doubt have been reinforced in his conclusions.
Ground 3 is also dismissed.
It follows that the claim is dismissed and the DHR should now be established by the claimant.
(Footnote reference from: 1)  Although likely to be a reference to the CSP, rather than the Crown Prosecution Service.
(Footnote reference from: 2)  Since the police questioned the accuracy of parts of CB's father's statement, those matters that they have challenged – for example that they had accepted making mistakes and had decided that it was an accidental death within hours without establishing the full facts– have not been included in the summary above and have been disregarded.

Master Brightwell :
This judgment concerns some questions which can arise in relation to the costs of an application to remove a personal representative pursuant to section 50 of the Administration of Justice Act 1985.
The claim relates to the estate of the late Mr Narayana Samy Madanagopalan, who died on 28 May 2020, leaving a will dated 3 April 2020. The defendants are his two daughters. By his will he appointed the claimant, a family friend, as his executor. The will disposes only of the property at 120 Fairholme Road, West Croydon, leaving 50% of the proceeds of sale to the second defendant, 30% to the first defendant, and the remaining 20% divided between the first defendant’s children. The claimant obtained a grant of probate on 22 September 2021.
I made an order at the first hearing of the claim, on 12 January 2024, removing the claimant as executor of the deceased’s estate. Unusually, the claimant sought her own removal. As she explained in her witness statement in support of the claim, the first defendant would not co-operate with her to enable the property to be marketed and sold, and the claimant felt threatened and harassed by her. I considered that the claimant’s unwillingness to continue in office in the face of an impasse justified the appointment of a new personal representative.
The second defendant did not attend the first hearing, but wrote to the court in advance of the hearing to indicate that she did not oppose the order sought by the claimant. In their letter dated 11 January 2024, her solicitors said that they did not intend to attend the hearing to save costs. Concern was expressed at the length of time taken in the administration of the estate and a wish stated that the claim could be dealt with swiftly and economically.
At that first hearing, I also decided that it was inappropriate to appoint the first defendant alone as a replacement personal representative. It was apparent from the claimant’s evidence that the two sisters had a history of making serious allegations against the other (including an allegation that the first defendant had murdered their father). It also appeared to me from the first defendant’s distressed state and her ill-health that it would not be correct to appoint her. In order to reach that decision, I did not need to take into account the nature of her conduct in relation to the administration of the estate, or of the nature of the allegations she had made in the current proceedings.
The claimant had by her claim put forward only one proposed replacement personal representative, with no details of his charging rates. As I considered that Ms Seeley had squarely raised the issue of such costs, I directed the claimant to put forward three proposed replacement independent personal representatives, together with their charging structure and an estimate of the costs required to complete the administration of the estate. In circumstances where there was to be another hearing and where the claimant indicated that she wished to obtain representation, I did not consider it appropriate to determine questions of costs on that occasion.
At the second hearing on 5 June 2024, which was intended to be the final hearing, I appointed Ms Lucy Wood of BP Collins LLP as replacement personal representative. She was the first defendant’s choice of the three suggested replacements put forward and neither the claimant nor the second defendant indicated any preference.
Again, the second defendant did not attend the hearing, but her solicitors sent a constructive letter dated 23 April 2024 to the court, saying that costs should be borne by the claimant and the first defendant, and also indicating as follows:
‘Our client has been extremely patient and has given the executor considerable time to deal with the administration, in the hope that things would work out without any application by our client to remove her and incur significant cost. Things were ultimately taken out of our client’s hands when the Claimant in this matter decided to make a court application to appoint independent administrators. She made the decision not to take any steps to defend the application as, in her view, the appointment of independent administrators is the best way to progress this matter and ensure that the property can finally be sold and the estate distributed.’
After dealing with the appointment of Ms Wood, I began to hear submissions on costs. Mr Kearney asked for the claimant’s costs to come from the estate. Ms Seeley then replied, stating as she had on several previous occasions that the claimant lacked capacity and that any instructions to the claimant’s solicitors must have come not from the claimant but from her daughter. In my ruling on 12 January 2024, I had indicated that I was satisfied that the claimant must have capacity because her solicitors had a professional obligation to ensure that this was so. The claimant’s solicitors were well aware of the allegation of lack of capacity (as it had been made by Ms Seeley on numerous occasions).
Given the frequency with which Ms Seeley had forcibly suggested that the claimant lacked capacity, I considered it appropriate at that point to ask Mr Kearney to confirm, for Ms Seeley’s benefit, that his solicitors were satisfied that their client had capacity. To my consternation, he indicated instead that they had in fact become aware of facts suggesting that she might have lost the capacity to litigate. When asked for a further explanation, Mr Kearney said that he and his solicitors had considered that the lack of capacity should not matter, because all that remained to be dealt with was the identity of the replacement personal representative and costs. He said that he and his solicitor had met with their client before the January 2024 hearing, and were satisfied then that she had capacity. I should also say that Mr Kearney immediately apologised for not having told the court about the concerns regarding his client’s capacity.
In circumstances where the claimant’s counsel was now indicating that she might not have capacity, I did not consider it appropriate to continue to determine questions of costs. There was no reason not to make the order appointing Ms Wood as the claimant had, when apparently having capacity, wished to be replaced, and an order directing that step had been made when she had capacity. But, CPR r 21.2(1) provides that a protected party must have a litigation friend to conduct proceedings, and by r 21.3(3), if during proceedings a party lacks capacity to continue to conduct proceedings, no party may take any further step without the court’s permission until the protected party has a litigation friend. It seemed to me that this prevents a party’s own legal representatives from taking steps on her behalf without the court’s permission. And, if those representatives consider it appropriate to proceed in that way, it is incumbent on them to seek that permission first, on notice to the other parties. The decision of the claimant’s lawyers in this case to keep their concerns up their sleeve, only revealing them when required to do so by a direct question from the court, was a serious error of judgment. As will be seen to be relevant below, it directly led to a further adjournment of this claim and to an increase in the costs incurred.
I therefore directed the solicitor with conduct of the claim on behalf of the claimant to file and serve a witness statement, indicating when she became aware that the claimant may not have capacity, and explaining how she was satisfied that she did have capacity when the claim was issued and as at the date of the first hearing, on 12 January 2024.
The claimant’s solicitor, Ms Caroline Roche, filed a witness statement dated 14 June 2024. She added a further apology for not having disclosed the issue to the court proactively. The witness statement also indicates that the first defendant made a complaint to the Legal Ombudsman in November 2023, alleging that the claimant lacked capacity, which complaint was dismissed, and explains why she, Ms Roche, was satisfied up to January 2024 as to the claimant’s capacity to make decisions in relation to the litigation and to communicate those decisions.
The claimant’s solicitors have also disclosed a mental capacity assessment carried out on 28 June 2024 by an independent mental capacity assessor. That assessment concludes that Mrs Aslam is able to understand, retain and weigh matters relating to the costs which have been incurred in these proceedings. It also (as does Ms Roche’s witness statement) discloses matters which show that there were solid grounds as at January 2024 (but not then known to Ms Roche) to suggest that the claimant’s litigation capacity may be in doubt. I do not consider it necessary for the purposes of this costs judgment to set out any further detail about the claimant’s health.
Ms Roche’s witness statement indicates that she was not aware of doubts as to the claimant’s capacity until she received a communication from the claimant’s daughter on 30 May 2024, shortly before the June hearing. I consider that to be consistent with the conclusion in the mental capacity assessment, and I accept Ms Roche’s evidence in this regard. It is worth stating that the first defendant’s concerns about capacity appear not to have been entirely misconceived, and they may have led to serious enquiry by the claimant’s solicitors at an earlier stage if they had not been accompanied by other intemperate and at times incoherent allegations directed at the solicitors.
Having considered the documents mentioned above, I considered that questions of costs required to be determined at a further hearing.
At the start of the hearing on 24 October 2024, the first defendant made an application for an adjournment, which I dismissed for the reasons I then gave. One of the grounds of the application was that the second defendant had served a witness statement made by her solicitor, with a very lengthy exhibit, very shortly before the hearing, and despite having been on notice of the hearing for some time. The second defendant had filed no evidence in response to the claim and at no stage sought directions permitting reliance on evidence for the purposes of costs. Not least as the second defendant strongly opposed an adjournment (as did the claimant), I did not consider it appropriate to permit the second defendant to rely on her solicitor’s witness statement. As Ms Seeley indicated that she had experienced difficulty in reading the bundle and that she had found a solicitor who could assist her in doing so, I gave her permission to file and serve further written submissions after the hearing, in response to the submissions of the other parties, provided they be filed by 14 November 2024.
Ms Seeley applied for, and I granted, an extension of time to 18 December 2024 when she filed further comments in the form of five separate emails which did not appear to have been prepared with the assistance of a legal representative. Ms Seeley also filed four emails on 4 December 2024, two of which attached voice recordings on which there was no permission to rely. I have not considered these recordings. The other parties indicated that they did not wish to respond further. I comment further below on what Ms Seeley has said.
The parties’ positions
The claimant seeks all her costs of the claim to be paid out of the estate on the indemnity basis. A schedule of costs has been filed and served for the costs of the proceedings, in the sum of £32,729.14. It represents an increase on the costs of the proceedings of £23,306.58 claimed in the schedule of costs filed in advance of the June 2024 hearing. Pursuant to a request from the solicitors for the second defendant, the claimant has also included in the bundle a bill of costs in a form appropriate for detailed assessment, rather than a schedule of costs in form N260. Unfortunately (and inexplicably), it was served on the second defendant on 17 October 2024, but was not made available to the first defendant until shortly before the hearing.
The claimant’s position is that, following her obtaining a grant of probate, the property was made ready for marketing, and marketed, in late 2022/early 2023. Attempts to progress a sale were frustrated by the first defendant, who countermanded her instructions to the estate agents, refused to allow a reduction to the marketed price despite a lack of interest, and at times refused to allow her access to the property. The claimant’s witness statement in support of the claim also refers to the first defendant’s aggressive conduct towards Duncan Lewis solicitors, who had been instructed by the claimant. The claimant, now aged 81, says that she became unwilling to deal with the harassment and aggression she faced from the first defendant. She says that, after the January 2024 hearing, the appointment of a replacement representative could have proceeded without a hearing, if the defendants had indicated their proposed replacement.
Mr Kearney relies in support of the claimant’s claim to costs out of the estate on the executor’s indemnity for costs properly incurred in the proceedings brought for the benefit of the estate. The claimant takes no positive position on whether the costs should be borne by the estate as a whole or by the share of the first defendant. Mr Kearney acknowledges that if the first defendant is personally liable for costs, they should be assessed on the standard and not the indemnity basis. He submits that none of the claimant’s costs have been incurred unreasonably and that there has been no conduct that would justify depriving her of her indemnity from the estate.
The bill of costs I have referred to above sought the higher sum of £47,606.46, to include also the costs incurred by the claimant in administering the estate, which are not the costs of these proceedings. Mr Kearney did not pursue that element of the costs application after I indicated that I was not satisfied that the court was seised of any question of costs other than costs of the removal claim.
Ms Madan, represented at this hearing by Mr Grandjouan, submits that the majority of the costs incurred by her and by the claimant should be borne from the first defendant’s share of the proceeds of sale of the property. Put simply, her position is that the first defendant’s conduct has delayed the administration of the estate and brought about this claim.
Mr Grandjouan points out that the second defendant indicated from the outset in her acknowledgment of service that she did not oppose the claim. He submits that the second defendant’s costs have been caused by her sister’s conduct and the claimant’s costs should therefore be borne by her share and not by the estate as a whole.
The arguments relied on by the second defendant are essentially twofold. She alleges that the proceedings were necessitated by Ms Seeley’s conduct. Ms Seeley had been aggressive to and had bullied the claimant, meaning that she was no longer prepared to act as an executor, despite this being a straightforward estate to administer. The evidence also suggests that she inappropriately interfered with the sale of the property and at times withheld the keys from the claimant. Mr Grandjouan also submitted that Ms Seeley should have consented to the claim, instead of contending that she should be appointed personal representative herself, and the costs would have been reduced if she had done so. He also suggested that Ms Seeley’s correspondence raised irrelevant matters; even where no response was sent, the emails had to be considered by the claimant’s solicitors.
The second defendant further seeks an order that the second defendant’s own costs be paid personally by the first defendant for the same reasons. The second defendant’s costs schedule for the proceedings is in the sum of £19,323.60. I would note that, in correspondence before the previous hearing, the second defendant sought an order that her costs be payable by both the first defendant and the claimant. No order is now sought against the claimant.
That leaves consideration of Ms Seeley’s position. She has not filed any evidence in these proceedings, but filed an acknowledgment of service which I gave her permission to rely on at the first hearing of the claim, even though it had not yet then been served. As she did at the previous hearing, she expanded on the points made in that acknowledgment of service with some considerable energy. I have also taken account of what she has said in the nine separate emails filed on 4 and 18 December 2024. These largely repeated points which had been made by her before.
Ms Seeley initially seems to have had a good relationship with the claimant, whom she has described as a friend (and also as being, in her words, ‘like my mum’), and also with Duncan Lewis solicitors, who were appointed to advise in the administration of the estate. Ms Seeley asserts that she herself made that instruction on the claimant’s behalf. This good relationship seems to have dissipated once the fee earner initially instructed had left the firm, and issues arose about the marketing of the property. It is Ms Seeley’s position that she, and not the claimant or Duncan Lewis, supervised and/or arranged works of repair at the property so that it could be marketed. As she considers that she alone has done work for the benefit of the estate, she does not believe the costs incurred by the claimant in instructing Duncan Lewis, at least latterly, to have been properly incurred.
The first defendant also maintains criticisms about Duncan Lewis as a firm, which appeared from her oral presentation to be more significant to her than her criticisms of the claimant. Indeed, it was Ms Seeley’s position from the start of the proceedings that the claimant lacked capacity and that she was incapable of giving instructions to her solicitors, those instructions coming instead from the claimant’s daughter. Ms Seeley has repeatedly asserted that Ms Roche has lied about this, and has continued to make serious allegations about her. She plainly also considers that Duncan Lewis have overcharged for the work they have carried out. She also considers that Ms Roche acted behind her back, to some extent because in the early stages she had direct contact with the firm and it appears was given a fee quote which has clearly (and in my view understandably) been significantly exceeded. I repeat that I am concerned only with the costs of these proceedings and not with the prior costs of administration. Duncan Lewis’s client for the purposes of these proceedings has been the claimant.
The points above had been made before by Ms Seeley, at the previous two hearings. She additionally raised some new points about the claimant and her family situation at the costs hearing. As the claimant had no opportunity to respond to them in evidence, I have not taken them into account but, in any event, they add nothing to the allegation already made that the claimant was not in fact providing instructions to her own solicitors. I do not consider that Ms Seeley’s allegations against Duncan Lewis of impropriety and dishonesty have been substantiated.
Relevant principles
The statutory provisions applicable to the indemnity of a trustee or personal representative were set out by Asplin LJ in Price v Saundry [2019] EWCA Civ 2261, which also in part concerned a claim for the removal of a personal representative, at [19]–[23]:
‘19. …. The general proposition in relation to reimbursement of a trustee from the trust fund is now to be found in section 31(1) of the Trustee Act 2000. It provides as follows:
A trustee—
is entitled to be reimbursed from the trust funds, or
may pay out of the trust funds,
expenses properly incurred by him when acting on behalf of the trust.”
Mr Learmonth also took us to the predecessor of section 31(1), section 30(2) of the Trustee Act 1925. That was in a slightly different form. It provided:
“A trustee may reimburse himself or pay or discharge out of the trust premises all expenses incurred in or about the execution of the trusts or powers.”
In relation to the costs of proceedings in which a trustee is or has been involved, there are specific provisions in the CPR. CPR 46.3 is concerned with the powers of the court to award costs in favour of trustees or personal representatives. It applies where a person is or has been a party to any proceedings in either of those capacities and costs are not payable under a contract to which CPR 44.5 applies. The general rule is that such a person:
. . . is entitled to be paid the costs of those proceedings, insofar as they are not recovered from or paid by any other person, out of the relevant trust fund or estate.”
Those costs will be assessed on the indemnity basis: CPR 46.3(3). The Rule is supplemented by 46PD.1 which provides as follows:
A trustee or personal representative is entitled to an indemnity out of the relevant trust fund or estate for costs properly incurred. Whether costs were properly incurred depends on all the circumstances of the case including whether the trustee or personal representative (“the trustee”)—
obtained directions from the court before bringing or defending the proceedings;
acted in the interests of the fund or estate or in substance for a benefit other than that of the estate, including the trustee's own; and
acted in some way unreasonably in bringing or defending, or in the conduct of, the proceedings.
The trustee is not to be taken to have acted for a benefit other than that of the fund by reason only that the trustee has defended a claim in which relief is sought against the trustee personally.”
The relevant Supreme Court Rules which preceded CPR 44.6 were also in a slightly different form. Order 62, r 6 which was headed “Cases where costs do not follow the event” provided (in its 1994 form, at least) where relevant, as follows:
“Where a person is or has been a party to any proceedings in the capacity of trustee . . . he shall be entitled to the costs of those proceedings, in so far as they are not recovered from or paid by any other person, out of the fund held by him in that capacity . . . and the court may order otherwise only on the ground that he has acted unreasonably or, in the case of a trustee . . . has in substance acted for his own benefit rather than for the benefit of the fund.”
It was common ground that the source of the right to an indemnity is to be found in section 31(1) of the Trustee Act 2000 and that the provisions of the CPR can only be a commentary upon and complementary to that section. That must be right and must also have been the case in relation to section 30(2) of the 1925 Act and Order 62 r 6 of the Supreme Court Rules. There was some discussion as to whether section 31(1) had changed the law and that the earlier case law should be seen in that light. It seems to me that that was not the effect of section 31(1) of the Trustee Act 2000. On the contrary, it seems to me that it was an attempt to codify the law as it stood.
Although many more trustees are remunerated as a result of express provisions in the trust deed than in Victorian times and in the early twentieth century, the policy behind the availability of an indemnity has not changed. It is designed to ensure that the trustee is not out of pocket when acting in his capacity as trustee on behalf of the trust and that the trust is efficiently and properly administered. Nothing has changed. The right to an indemnity is part of the fabric of the relationship between the settlor, the trustees and the beneficiaries: see Turner v Hancock (1882) 20 Ch D 303 per Jessel, MR at 305.’
Mr Kearney referred also to the judgment of HHJ Matthews in Mussell v Patience [2019] EWHC 1231 (Ch) at [17], where he said this:
‘17. I cannot deprive executors of their indemnity out of the estate for costs or other expenses or liabilities which they have incurred for the estate unless they have incurred them improperly. This in summary form is the effect of section 31 of the Trustee Act 2000 (applied to executors by section 35) and CPR Part 46 Practice Direction, paragraph 1, acting as an exception to the general rule in CPR rule 46.3. In the caselaw before the CPR and the 2000 Act it was sometimes put (and is still sometimes put) in the form, had the executors or trustees behaved unreasonably, or committed misconduct? But I do not think the variation in words makes any difference in substance.’
Mr Kearney pointed out that, to the extent that costs are awarded inter partes and not from the estate, there was no presumption that they would be paid on the indemnity basis. Mr Grandjouan acknowledged this, and recognised that if an order were made that the first defendant pay some or all of the claimant’s costs from her share, those costs should be assessed on the standard basis. To the extent that the claimant was entitled to recover a greater sum on the indemnity basis, the balance would be recoverable from the estate as a whole.
On the separate question of whether the first defendant should bear the claimant’s costs from her own share of the estate, Mr Grandjouan relies on the decision of Roth J in Green v Astor [2013] EWHC 1857 (Ch). That was a complex application for directions by the administrator of an estate. Roth J set out the three categories of trust litigation as derived from Re Buckton [1907] 2 Ch 406. The starting point where costs are necessarily incurred for the benefit of the estate, whether the claim is issued by a personal representative or by a beneficiary, is that they be paid out of the estate. As far as the costs of the claimant personal representative are concerned, that is consistent with modern principle, as summarised in Price v Saundry, even though the Buckton principles were established with conventional trustee directions applications in mind.
Even though applications under section 50 of the 1985 Act are often issued and fought out as conspicuously hostile litigation, it is quite possible for them to be both issued and defended in the interests of the beneficiaries of the estate as a whole. Indeed, the present claim, where the claimant sought her own removal because of her age and because of the difficulties which had arisen in her relationship with Ms Seeley, might be seen to be an obvious case of such a claim issued for the benefit of the estate. Where proceedings are hostile, on the other hand, costs will normally be determined only in accordance with the general principles applicable to costs in civil proceedings, i.e. pursuant to CPR r 44.2.
Mr Grandjouan relies on Roth J’s comments in Green v Astor at [54], to the submission of the administrator in that case that her costs should be paid by a beneficiary personally, because of his conduct:
‘54. Mr Ham responded that a beneficiary has no duty to consent to action proposed by an administrator, or indeed to be polite. That is no doubt correct, but equally, in my judgment, a beneficiary cannot expect to be immune from liability in costs irrespective of his conduct. An order of costs is not to be applied as a sanction for the intemperate and frequently insulting language of Mr Astor's correspondence. But in my view, where unreasonable conduct by a beneficiary is responsible for generating substantial costs on the part of a trustee or personal representative as regards an application to the court, it is appropriate that the burden of those costs should be borne by that beneficiary and not fall on the trust or estate and thus the beneficiaries as a whole.’
Roth J went on to say this, at [55]–[56]:
‘55. Mr Astor evidently lost all confidence in Mrs Green as administrator and wished to be in a position where he had before him all the information available to Mrs Green so that he could, in effect, verify all the steps she took in administration of the estate. I have quoted above relatively short extracts from some of the very many emails which Mr Astor sent to Mrs Green. It is his conduct, alone among the beneficiaries, which has led Mrs Green to seek the approval of the court to the Partition Agreement on which she had favourable advice from a Swiss lawyer, which advice she shared with the beneficiaries, and to which the other beneficiaries consented. Further, I consider that it is the conduct of Mr Astor in the litigation which has done much to escalate the costs until, in the light of the agreement “brokered” by Peter Smith J on 2 May 2013, Mr Astor made clear by his counsel for the first time at the opening of the trial that, subject to the question of the power under Swiss law, he was not opposing Mrs Green's exercise of her discretion in entering into the Partition Agreement.
Although in form an application that comes within category (1) of Buckton, I do not think it falls neatly within Kekewich J’s tripartite classification. It has far more the character of hostile litigation, in which the other individual beneficiaries support the position of the personal representative, who has faced sustained hostility and opposition from the one beneficiary who has opposed this claim. Having regard to the overall justice of the case, I do not regard this as one where the costs should fall on the estate, and thus be at the expense of all the beneficiaries. The appropriate order, in my judgment, is that the costs referable to the second head of relief should be paid by Mr Astor.’
I take from this the following two propositions. First that, where a claim or an application by a trustee or personal representative is necessitated by the unreasonable conduct of a beneficiary, that beneficiary may be ordered to pay some or all of the costs incurred by the claimant even though prima facie they are costs which would generally be payable out of the estate pursuant to the indemnity of the trustee or personal representative. And, secondly, that conduct within the litigation itself can justify a similar approach. The purpose of this approach is to protect the interests of other beneficiaries from costs which have not been incurred for the benefit of the estate, in order to respond to unreasonable conduct on the part of another beneficiary. Roth J made clear that he was considering the overall justice of the case, and that the court continues to exercise a discretion in order to do justice between the parties. Furthermore, as he emphasised at [48] (citing IBM United Kingdom Pensions Trust Ltd v Metcalfe [2012] EWHC 125 (Ch) at [20]) and at [56], not all cases neatly fit within the Buckton categories.
I consider that similar considerations apply to the question whether the second defendant can recover her costs from the first defendant. In this case, the second defendant has not explicitly sought an order for her costs out of the estate as a whole, but only that they be paid by the first defendant out of her share of the estate. Mr Grandjouan did, however, also submit that any costs not recoverable from the first defendant should be payable out of the estate, and on the indemnity basis. The starting point where proceedings are brought for the benefit of the estate is that the costs of all parties are paid out of the estate. It follows that where a party’s costs have been incurred or increased because of the conduct of a beneficiary, an order may be made that such beneficiary should bear some or all of the costs of the other party.
Discussion
The claimant’s costs
I consider that, prima facie, proceedings issued by a personal representative for her own removal because she is no longer properly able to act in the role are proceedings brought for the benefit of the estate. She is entitled to her costs out of the estate unless she has acted improperly (or unreasonably, see Mussell v Patience, discussed above).
I find no reason why the claimant was unreasonable in issuing the proceedings. Her own witness statement sets out a compelling story of Ms Seeley interfering in the sale process in relation to the property, and aggressively and angrily challenging the actions of both the claimant and her solicitors. That is all consistent with what Ms Seeley has written in correspondence during the course of these proceedings, which is in the hearing bundle, and with what she has said in court. While her behaviour in court has been polite, Ms Seeley has tended to become somewhat impassioned when discussing her complaints, at times showing signs of anger. Her complaints are also to some extent incoherent. This all tends to support what is said by the claimant in her witness statement.
There is also the factor, for which the claimant cannot herself be in any way blamed, that she is not in good health. It is clear from the capacity report that, even though she has capacity, there are material issues with her health. This suggests to me that it will have been apparent to those around her for some time that it might be better for some other person to take over the role of acting as personal representative of Mr Madanagopalan’s estate.
Ms Seeley’s complaints about the claimant, or about Duncan Lewis, are essentially in relation to the period before the claim was issued. I have summarised those points above. Ms Seeley accepted during the hearing that she had withheld the key to the property from the claimant and had instructed the estate agents to take the property off the market without consent. She accepted that had been a mistake. These matters, in my view, largely concern her complaint about costs incurred before the proceedings started and not the costs of the claim. Those earlier costs are not before me for consideration (although I would comment that I have seen and heard nothing to suggest that Ms Seeley’s complaints are well founded).
Ms Seeley has put forward no coherent reason why the commencement of the claim by the claimant was unreasonable. She suggested that the claimant had signed a document renouncing probate but, as she had a grant in her favour, this could have been of no effect.
Apart from the reason for the adjournment of the June 2024 hearing which I have described above, I do not consider there to be any improper or unreasonable conduct on the part of the claimant such as to justify depriving her of her indemnity from the estate. Some criticism might be made for the failure to provide costs information for the one proposed independent administrator put forward at the first hearing, but I do not consider this to be improper or unreasonable in the sense discussed in the authorities, and neither defendant suggested that it was. That first hearing was adjourned both for that information to be provided (and for two other alternatives to be proposed), and also because I did not consider it appropriate to decide questions of costs when Ms Seeley was unrepresented and indicated that she wanted to obtain representation for that purpose. The hearing had also overrun its short hearing time. The other costs incurred by the claimant, in obtaining details of alternative personal representatives had to be incurred in any event.
Accordingly, I consider that the claimant is entitled to recover her costs of the claim, save for those costs thrown away by the adjournment of the June 2024 hearing. Her schedule of costs for the proceedings as at that date came to a total of £23,306.58, as against the total of £32,729.14 sought at the final hearing (a difference of around £9,400).
I have come to the view that the appropriate starting point is in principle to allow to the claimant from the estate the sum sought in the schedule of costs filed in advance of the June 2024 hearing (around £23,300). Whilst it was the costs of that hearing which were thrown away, the final costs hearing was of a similar length, and Mr Kearney’s brief fee (of £2,500) was the same. Furthermore, the costs incurred in the preparation of Ms Roche’s witness statement explaining her understanding of the claimant’s capacity were incurred after the June 2024 hearing, and directly result from what I consider to be unreasonable conduct.
Set against that, I recognise that some element of the costs incurred after June 2024, such as consideration of the capacity report, and corresponding with the other parties on costs, were not improperly incurred. To take account of this, and as the assessment is on the indemnity basis, I allow the claimant the slightly higher sum of £25,000 inclusive of VAT. Ms Seeley objected to any costs being met from the estate but did not make any more particularised objections. Save for that element disallowed above, I do not consider that the costs can be shown to be unreasonably incurred or unreasonable in amount and any doubt would fall to be resolved in favour of the claimant as receiving party.
The second defendant’s costs
As noted above, Ms Madan seeks orders that the claimant’s costs and her own be borne by Ms Seeley, by their being paid out of Ms Seeley’s share of the estate as it is administered. With reference to the discussion of Green v Astor, above, I consider that there are two material questions: were the proceedings necessitated only by the conduct of the first defendant, and has the conduct of the first defendant escalated the costs incurred in such a way that a costs order ought to be made against her?
It is clear to me that these proceedings were necessary, and that the claimant could not remain as personal representative. Complaint is made on behalf of the second defendant of Ms Seeley’s conduct before the claim was brought but, on the assumption that those complaints are well founded, they do not show that the entire proceedings were unnecessary. Indeed, her position appears to have been that she would commence proceedings herself if the claimant did not do so, it being obvious that the administration of the estate was not proceeding. The fact that the claimant did so obviated the need for the second defendant to incur those costs. Criticism might also be made of the claimant in not acting sooner to deal with the impasse in administration, but that cannot be a reason to subject the first defendant to a personal costs order.
What about the conduct of the first defendant during the proceedings? It might be said that the claim could have been dealt with at far less expense if it had not been opposed by Ms Seeley. From the perspective of the second defendant, however, the litigation costs she incurred in relation to the hearings in January and June 2024 were necessarily limited. She did not attend either hearing, and her involvement was limited to instructing her solicitors to write a sensible letter, indicating that she did not intend to be represented at the hearing, and seeking the appointment of a new personal representative and the conclusion of the proceedings as expeditiously as possible. The need for, and cost incurred in writing, such letters was not caused by the conduct of the first defendant.
As far as the claimant’s costs were concerned, the first hearing was adjourned partly to enable fuller costs information to be provided, which was not a result of Ms Seeley’s unreasonable conduct. The second hearing was also adjourned for reasons which were not unreasonable conduct on Ms Seeley’s part. The costs then incurred by the claimant in pursuing and justifying her claim to costs were also necessarily and reasonably incurred, save to the extent that they have been disallowed, and again not caused by Ms Seeley’s conduct.
That leaves the costs incurred by the second defendant in preparing for and attending the final hearing to determine the costs of the claim. This accounts for more than half the second defendant’s costs, or some £10,400. I consider it to be very relevant that this hearing was needed only because of the adjournment of the previous hearing, which adjournment was the responsibility of the claimant and not of the first defendant. If it had not been for that adjournment, the claim would have been concluded at the second hearing, at which the second defendant was not represented. Even though her solicitors wrote to the court before the hearing, no costs schedule was filed. The second defendant’s real participation in the proceedings thus began after the point at which it would have concluded were it not for the issue of the claimant’s capacity arising in the way that it did.
Standing back, it does not appear to me that those costs incurred after June 2024 were incurred by the second defendant as a result of the unreasonable conduct of Ms Seeley. They were incurred by the second defendant acting in response to the unanticipated adjournment and belatedly putting in a claim for costs.
I consider that the comments of Roth J in Green v Astor at [54] are apposite. He there said that a costs order was not to be made as a sanction for intemperate and insulting language, but where unreasonable conduct generates substantial costs. Some of what Ms Seeley has said has certainly been insulting, but those insults have been aimed at the claimant’s solicitors and not at the second defendant or her solicitors. I agree that the other parties have had to read what Ms Seeley has said, but I consider that it must have been apparent to the second defendant all along that no substantive response from her would be required.
Accordingly, I do not consider it appropriate to make an order that the first defendant pay the second defendant’s costs, or any of the claimant’s costs.
As I have indicated above, the claim was brought by the claimant for the benefit of the estate. To the extent that they were incurred in such respect, the second defendant is in principle entitled to an order that her costs be paid out of the estate on the indemnity basis. I do not consider that this applies to her costs incurred since the June 2024 hearing, which have been essentially incurred in pursuing the first defendant personally, on grounds which I do not consider to have been made out. If a costs schedule had been filed for the June 2024 hearing, then the second defendant’s costs could have been finally dealt with then, even if the making of an order might have had to await confirmation whether or not the claimant had capacity.
That leaves her costs incurred up to June 2024, which are said to be £8,889.50. Even without consideration of Ms Rixon’s witness statement, which I did not admit, it is clear to me that the second defendant necessarily incurred costs in relation to the subject matter of the claim before the proceedings were issued, and also in considering the claim and in making a constructive response to the claim once issued. The schedule of costs does not enable the costs in that period to be separately identified, but resolving any doubt in favour of the second defendant, I consider £6,000 plus VAT to be a reasonable sum for the instruction of solicitors and for the correspondence undertaken both before and after the start of the proceedings.
Conclusion
For the reasons I have set out above, I will order that the costs of both the claimant and the second defendant be paid as assessed out of the estate of the deceased (and thus borne proportionally by the beneficiaries). The claimant’s costs are summarily assessed at £25,000 and the second defendant’s costs at £7,200, both figures inclusive of VAT.
Finally, by an email sent to the court on 2 January 2025, Ms Seeley asked me not to complete this judgment, but to allow her a further opportunity to obtain representation and to put in evidence. Following the circulation of the draft judgment, she has sent five further emails to the court to similar effect. I am satisfied that Ms Seeley has had every opportunity to obtain representation and to respond to the costs claims against her and against the estate. The other parties are entitled to the conclusion of these proceedings and there are no grounds to justify delaying this decision any further.

Judgment by DAME CLARE MOULDER
Introduction
This is the Court’s judgment on the application dated 9 January, 2025 of the defendant, Kuit Steinart Levy LLP (“Kuits”), to adjourn the trial in these proceedings by reason of the illness of leading counsel instructed in this matter for the defendant.
The application is supported by the witness statement of Mr William Glynn, a partner in Clyde & Co LLP, having conduct of the defence of this claim on behalf of the defendant, dated 9 January 2025.
The application is opposed by the claimants and the claimants rely on the ninth witness statement of Ms Anna Maxwell, partner in the firm of Enyo Law LLP, who acts for the claimants.
The Court has also had the benefit of written and oral submissions from counsel on each side.
Background
This is a claim for professional negligence against Kuits, a firm of solicitors based in Manchester.  The first claimant, formerly known as Beech Holdings, is a wholly owned company of the second claimant, Stephen Beech (“Mr Beech”).  Mr Beech is and was a property developer based in Manchester.  Through Beech Holdings, Mr Beech carried out substantial property developments in and around Manchester City Centre.
In 2016, Mr Beech and Beech Holdings retained Kuits to act in connection with the negotiation and agreement of a substantial loan facility (the “Facility”) with a private investment firm, Roundshield Luxembourg SARL (“Roundshield”).  The claimants claim that Kuits acted in breach of contract and/or negligently in allowing the Facility to be drafted in the way that it was and/or failing to advise them about it.  In particular, the Facility provided for a minimum return fee which became payable in full at an early stage in the life of the Facility.
It is the claimants’ case that Roundshield was able to rely on its rights under the Facility to deprive Beech Holdings and Mr Beech of the cash required to support developments and ultimately to force them to cede control over the business.  The claimants’ primary case is that had they been properly advised, the Facility would have been drafted to reflect their intentions, Beech Holdings would have been a profitable enterprise left with a substantial portfolio of city central investment assets, and Mr Beech would have retained a personal property portfolio.  The loss claimed by Beech Holdings is pleaded at around £21 million for Beech Holdings and a further £11 million for Mr Beech.
The matter is currently listed for a trial commencing on 20 January 2025, with three days set aside for pre-reading on 14 to 16 January 2025.  There are eight lay witnesses in total, and the parties each have three experts, all of whom will be called to give evidence.  The experts are in the fields of property valuation, development evidence, and forensic accountancy.
Relevant law
The Court has a discretion whether to adjourn a trial under CPR 3.12(b).  It is a power which the Court must exercise in accordance with the overriding objective, namely, to deal with cases justly and at proportionate cost.
The law was largely common ground between the parties.  Both parties accepted the law as set out in Bilta (UK) Ltd ((in Liquidation)) & Others v Tradition Financial Services Ltd [2021] EWCA Civ 221 and I was referred to paragraph 30 of the judgment:
“…the guiding principle in an application to adjourn of this type is whether if the trial goes ahead it will be fair in all the circumstances; that the assessment of what is fair is a fact-sensitive one, and not one to be judged by the mechanistic application of any particular checklist; that although the inability of a party himself to attend trial through illness will almost always be a highly material consideration, it is artificial to seek to draw a sharp distinction between that case and the unavailability of a witness; and that the significance to be attached to the inability of an important witness to attend through illness will vary from case to case, but that it will usually be material, and may be decisive.  And if the refusal of an adjournment would make the resulting trial unfair, an adjournment should ordinarily be granted, regardless of inconvenience to the other party or other court users, unless this were outweighed by injustice to the other party that could not be compensated for.” [emphasis added]
I also note at [49]:
“Mr Scorey’s propositions were as follows:
…
When considering whether a particular outcome is fair, it should not be assumed that only one outcome is fair.
This is established by the authorities: Terluk at [20], Dhillon at [33(b)].   But equally in some circumstances there is really only one answer: see Teinaz at [20] (“some adjournments must be granted”).
Fairness involves fairness to both parties.  But inconvenience to the other party (or other court users) is not a relevant countervailing factor and is usually not a reason to refuse an adjournment.
This is again established by the authorities.  As to fairness involving fairness to both parties, see Dhillon at [33(a)], Solanki at [35].  As to the requirements of a fair trial taking precedence over inconvenience to the other party or other court users, see Teinaz at [21].  But Mr Scorey acknowledged, as can be seen from the earliest cases, that uncompensatable injustice to the other party may be a ground for refusing an adjournment.” [emphasis added]
The claimants also referred the Court to Innovate Pharmaceuticals Ltd v University of Portsmouth Higher Education Corporation [2023] EWHC 2394 at [3].  In that case, Mr Justice Constable enumerated the factors that the Court should take into account in the context of a late application to adjourn. They were:
The parties’ conduct and the reason for the delays;
The extent to which the consequence of the delays can be overcome before the trial;
The extent to which a fair trial may have been jeopardised by the delays;
Specific matters affecting the trial, such as the illness of a critical witness and the like;
The consequences of an adjournment for the claimant, the defendant, and the court.”
I note that the facts in Innovate Pharmaceuticals were very different to the present case.  I accept the submission for the claimants that the principles are capable of more general application, but clearly the weight to be given to the various factors identified need to reflect the circumstances of the particular case and the Court must exercise its power in accordance with the overriding objective.
Facts
Turning to the facts of what has occurred in this case leading to the application by the defendant to adjourn the trial.  From the witness statement of Mr Glynn, it is apparent that he was told by one of the barrister’s clerks on the morning of 8 January 2025 that the clerk in turn had been told on the evening of 7 January 2025 that the defendant’s leading counsel had become unwell and could not appear at the forthcoming trial.
Mr Glynn states that the defendant took urgent steps to explore whether there were any credible options other than to apply to adjourn the trial.  Mr Glynn states that the defendant has carefully considered whether it is possible fairly to proceed without the counsel who has been involved as leading counsel throughout the proceedings and was expected to appear as lead advocate at trial as he has at the two previous hearings in this matter.
Mr Glynn further stated that the defendant has considered instructing alternative leading counsel.  However, given the proximity of the trial, its length, the quantum at stake, the complexity of the issues, and the volume of the material which would need to be digested, the defendant has concluded that instructing alternative leading counsel in the time available is not a realistic option and would not be a fair one.  The relevant chambers have identified two junior counsel who could potentially be instructed for at least part of the trial to provide further assistance, but Mr Glynn stated that that would not be an adequate replacement for leading counsel.
Defendant’s submissions
In his submissions for the defendant, Mr Harris submitted that he was seeking an adjournment until such time as the defendant was able to instruct new leading counsel.  He noted the circumstances of the current case, that the application for the adjournment was due to the ill health of leading counsel, and it was not proposed by the defendant that the Court should wait for the particular leading counsel to recover.
Mr Harris stressed that the defendant had been deprived of the individual which they expected to advise and guide them through the proceedings and to present the most important aspects of the case.  It was submitted that the defendant cannot obtain a replacement within the time suggested by the claimants (a delay of one week to the start of the trial).  He submitted that the claimants’ proposal to further delay the start of the trial for two or possibly three weeks would not give the defendant time to instruct new leading counsel.
It was submitted for Mr Harris that having him appear as the junior counsel would not be the same as having leading counsel:  he was not the trial advocate chosen by the defendant or the trial advocate that they would have chosen.  The defendant had recognised that they needed an experienced leader in the case, albeit supported by Mr Harris as a junior.
In addition, it was submitted that, in any event, Mr Harris as junior counsel does not have sufficient time to prepare.  It was not intended that he would cross-examine the major witnesses or the forensic accountants, and although it was suggested that Mr Harris could use the notes that have already perhaps been prepared by leading counsel, Mr Harris submitted that it was not the case that he could simply “learn the lines” as if in a play.  He noted that the proposal from the claimants that the Court could adopt a more compressed timetable which would allow more time for preparation at the outset would in fact add to the overall pressure by reason of the compressed the timetable thereby compressing both the time for witnesses and for the preparation of closing submissions.
In relation to the impact on the claimants, Mr Harris accepted the stress that an adjournment would place on the claimants.  In relation to the additional costs, he submitted that these could and should be mitigated by the cessation of work and that parties should recognise that this was not an opportunity to make further applications.
In relation to the memory of witnesses, which the claimants had suggested would be prejudiced by any delay, Mr Harris submitted that these proceedings have been brought by the claimants on the cusp of limitation.
In relation to the availability of leading counsel for the claimants if the trial were to be adjourned, he noted that counsel for the claimants had indicated that he had prior commitments in relation to 2026.
In relation to the prejudice raised by the claimants as concerns their funding arrangements and the need for further costs to be incurred in relation to after the event insurance, Mr Harris submitted that he obviously did not know the precise funding position and thus was in a difficult position to gainsay the submissions of the claimants, but he questioned whether the funding arrangements were as tight and inflexible as the claimants indicated and why a funder would not be prepared to see the proceedings to close.  He noted that the course of litigation is rarely smooth and that there would therefore likely be provision for unforeseen contingencies.
Claimants’ submissions
For the claimants, it was submitted that they do not dispute the integrity of the reason given for the adjournment application.  However, it was submitted by Mr Hext KC for the claimants that the prejudice that would be inflicted, were the application to be granted, is very substantial.  It was submitted by Mr Hext that there would be a significant delay if the trial would be adjourned, given that it is likely that it could not be accommodated for many months, possibly not until the beginning of, or even later, in 2026.  It was submitted that this is significant both emotionally for the claimants and financially.  It was submitted that the matters referred to in the proceedings have already had a catastrophic impact on Mr Beech personally and the claimants’ business interests more widely, and an adjournment would therefore have a significant effect on Mr Beech.
As to the additional costs it was submitted that the time required for both sides to get back up to speed will be significant.  It was submitted that there will be a need to prepare for trial all over again, there will be new brief fees, and the experts will need to re-familiarise themselves with the evidence and have meetings with the lawyers.  Even if the claimants are ultimately successful, the costs would not be recoverable until after judgment.
Leading counsel referred to the constraints on his availability for an adjourned trial, having trials listed in March 2026 and in June and July 2026.  That would mean that he was only available in the autumn of 2026.  Mr Hext also indicated that he has existing commitments in the autumn of 2025.
Most significantly, Mr Hext submitted that there would be prejudice to the claimants in terms of their funding.  It was submitted that the current budget will not be sufficient to accommodate further costs incurred on an adjournment and therefore the claimants would be obliged to go back to the funders to seek an increase in the budget.  It was submitted that, given the overall economics of the case at this stage, it is not certain that the claimants would be able to secure further funding for the deferred hearing.  Mr Hext stated that the claimants had already had to get further funding because the costs had already exceeded the original budget.
The consequence, it was submitted, of having to go back to the funders, could be that the claimants would be unable to pursue the claim to conclusion.  That, it was submitted, would be grossly unfair and prejudicial and would deny the claimants’ access to justice.
Mr Hext also raised the prejudice that, on the assumption that the costs of the adjourned trial would run into the high hundreds of thousands of pounds, the multiple which the funders would require, which is taken out of the damages recovered and is not recoverable in costs, would, in the estimate of Ms Maxwell, be nearly £2 million.
Mr Hext submitted that ATE cover has also been procured for this claim and may need to be extended.  Again, the premium payable would need to be funded and a multiple would also be applied to those funds.  Ms Maxwell estimated that the premium for that additional element could itself run to several hundreds of thousands of pounds, depending on the level of additional cover needed, and an ATE premium is not recoverable in costs.
Turning to the potential impact on the defendant, Mr Hext submitted that the absence of leading counsel does not make a trial unfair.  The trial is decided on the evidence and it is not always possible for parties to instruct leading counsel.  It was submitted that Mr Harris, called in 2003, is an accomplished senior junior with significant experience of complex, high-value professional negligence cases.  Mr Hext submitted that Mr Harris would have assistance.  He could bring in other juniors who could take on discrete areas of the case.  It was submitted that Mr Harris will already have a significant knowledge of the documents, he will have been involved in the preparation of the opening submissions and, turning to the trial, Mr Hext submitted that there would only be a need for a short opening and that Mr Harris has already been preparing for cross-examination of some of the witnesses.
It was submitted that whilst it may not be the defendant’s preference to proceed without leading counsel, the Court has to weigh the relative prejudice to the parties involved in adjourning the trial or refusing an adjournment, and the fact that the defendant would be represented by a senior junior rather than leading counsel cannot bear too much weight.
Discussion
As referred to above in the authorities, the Court has to weigh the conflicting considerations; determining whether a refusal of the adjournment would make the trial unfair to the defendant, and if it would, whether that is outweighed by irremediable prejudice to the claimants.
The factors which the Court takes into account in this case are as follows.
Impact of delay
Firstly, the delay which will result if the trial is adjourned.  The Court seeks to deal with matters expeditiously as the parties should be able to resolve their disputes as soon as practicable.  It is unfair and unjust on both parties if proceedings drag on unnecessarily.
The Court acknowledges the huge stress that pending court proceedings place on witnesses, and more especially, those individuals who have a financial or personal interest in the outcome of the proceedings.  It is also disruptive for other court users if trials are adjourned, as time allocated to this trial may not be capable of being fully utilised if adjourned, and time available in future for other court users will be reduced.  Given the length of this particular trial, I accept that any delay if the trial is adjourned is likely to be significant.  It would not be possible (as the parties suggested) merely to extend the trial window by a couple of weeks (to allow further time for junior counsel to prepare) or to relist the trial with a delay of only a couple of months (to allow new leading counsel for the defendant to be instructed). The Commercial Court cannot easily find space in the existing list to alter the trial window or to relist a case which will occupy court resources for over half a term.
I also accept the claimants’ submission that if the trial were to be adjourned, significant logistical and financial challenges will impact both sides given the need to take into account the availability of the witnesses, the experts, and the legal teams.  I note the issues raised by claimants’ own leading counsel in terms of any relisting, both in 2025 and 2026, but it is of course not unknown for counsel teams to have to change in the course of long running matters or for diary commitments to change. That is wholly different from the situation in which the defendant now finds itself:  the issue that is currently before the Court is the change of counsel given the imminence of the trial and whether, given those circumstances, an adjournment at this point should be ordered.  The claimants’ own position concerning its counsel in the future would not, in my view, amount to irremediable prejudice at this juncture.  Nevertheless, I take into the balancing exercise the fact that, if the trial is adjourned, there will be a considerable delay which will have the consequences discussed above and which is likely to be of many months before the proceedings can be relisted and thus resolved.
Witnesses
As to the impact on witnesses of any adjournment, it seems to me that, given the considerable period that has already elapsed – the issues date back to as early as 2016 – any further delay resulting from an adjournment is unlikely to have a material impact on the quality of the witness evidence and thus on the outcome of the proceedings.  In my view, this is not a significant factor to weigh in considering whether or not to grant an adjournment.
Additional costs
As to the additional costs, if the trial is adjourned, there will inevitably be further costs.  However, the witness evidence and expert evidence has been finalised, the skeleton for the claimants has been filed, and I understand that the defendant’s skeleton is also in final form.  I see no reason therefore why further significant costs would be incurred on an adjournment in relation to the existing evidence, or that there should be a need for any further or additional disclosure.  Whilst it is not unknown that a particular document comes to light late and is disclosed even during trial, given the stage of the proceedings that has been reached, there is no reason to assume that, absent some unforeseen event, the Court would sanction additional disclosure requests prior to any adjourned trial which would involve any significant expense.
I do accept, however, that having to put down a matter and then pick it up again many months later, especially in a case as complex as this, would require additional work, as both lawyers and expert witnesses would have to refresh their memories in readiness for trial, and in this particular case, given the volume of material, this is a not insubstantial task.  If new counsel is instructed on either side, that will have additional costs as they are brought up to speed.  However, in the circumstances where this case is ready for trial, I do not accept the submission for the claimants that the additional costs would be in the high hundreds of thousands.
Prejudice to the Defendant
Turning then to the prejudice to the defendant if the adjournment is refused.  The claimant has proposed a delay to the start of trial by one week to allow junior counsel for the defendant a two-week period to prepare, and in the alternative, suggested a possible extension beyond the trial window, which would allow the defendant say, three weeks to prepare.  As referred to above, in my view the latter option is not possible within the Commercial Court list.
Two versions of the draft timetable were before the Court at the PTR.  The main difference between them is that one envisaged a week’s break for written closings; the other saw written closings fitted in over the weekend break and required the Court to sit longer than usual on two days.  At the PTR, the Court’s decision was to adopt the longer timetable, but I accept that it would be possible to revert to a shorter and more compressed timetable.  This would allow the trial to start a week later and still to finish as scheduled within the trial window.
However, even if the timetable was adjusted and compressed in this way, at most it would only give the defendant’s junior counsel two weeks to prepare to cross-examine the entirety of the claimants’ witnesses, both factual and expert.  The compressed timetable was originally rejected by the Court because it compressed the timetable and placed unnecessary burdens on both parties.  It would therefore, it seems to me, place greater stress on junior counsel (including in relation to the preparation of closing arguments) if the court were to adopt the compressed timetable within the trial window, even assuming that it allowed sufficient time to prepare for cross examination which in my view is does not.  If notwithstanding the Commercial Court listing constraints referred to above, additional time were able to be found after the end of the trial window only for closings, this could allow further time to prepare closings, but it would not assist junior counsel in terms of preparing for cross-examination.
The delay of a week or two weeks would not allow the defendant sufficient time to find alternative leading counsel.  I accept that junior counsel for the defendant in this case is very familiar with the issues and therefore most probably the documents, that he is experienced, and is likely to have had a major role in the preparation of the written openings.  I have also considered that junior counsel was going to cross-examine some of the witnesses, although the court has been told that they were not the major witnesses and did not extend to the forensic accounting evidence.  Were junior counsel for the defendant now to take over the entirety of the cross-examination, he may obtain some assistance from the notes already prepared by the defendant’s leading counsel, but I accept the defendant’s submission that the notes are of limited assistance and do not come close to providing a complete answer to the issue of lack of time to prepare to carry out cross-examination and generally to take over leading the case.
In my view, it would not be fair to expect junior counsel, even an experienced junior counsel as in this case, to take over the cross-examination in this trial and to take it forward as the leader, either on the existing timetable or the slightly delayed timetable.  I reached this conclusion not because of the ability of junior counsel, who is, as I have said, a senior junior; rather for the reasons that this is a long and a complex trial.  I have in mind the three sets of expert evidence in this case and the issues which are covered in the expert reports, including the number of properties and the large number of variables which are in play in the forensic reports.
Although junior counsel is familiar with the documentation, it is not the same as being prepared to lead the case, and it is no answer to the difficulty to suggest that other juniors could be brought in to assist and that the defendant can be expected only to make a short opening.  To have a fair trial, the defendant should have a proper opportunity to defend the case brought against it.  Whilst I accept that there is no need to have leading counsel present in every case, this is a very substantial trial, even in the Commercial Court.  I note that the complexity of this matter resulted in counsel for the claimants recently seeking permission from the Court to file an opening skeleton of 90 pages rather than the usual Commercial Court limit of 50 pages and mindful of the issues which the Court had seen at the PTR, such permission was granted. It is a case in which it is to be expected that leading counsel would be instructed assuming that the party has the resources to do so, which, in this case, it appears to have.
The overriding objective requires that, so far as practicable, the parties should be on an equal footing.  In this regard, I take into account that Kuits is the defendant in this case, which has therefore been obliged to defend itself against a claim brought against it.  In my view to force the defendant to proceed with the junior counsel on the current timetable to trial, or even within the current trial window, would be unfair and the resulting trial would be unfair.
Prejudice to the claimants
The Court has to consider the prejudice to the claimants which would result from any adjournment and, in particular, the issue of the potential loss of funding and or the additional funding costs at which the claimants would incur, and whether this prejudice is such as to outweigh the unfairness to the defendant.
As to funding, I accept that the claimants do not currently have funding for any additional costs.  I also accept that it is not certain that the claimants would be able to secure further funding.  However, the merits of the claim have not changed by what has occurred.  On that basis, there is no grounds to suppose that, for that reason alone, additional funding to allow the matter to be taken to its conclusion would not be likely to be forthcoming.  In my view, it seems more likely that the funder would wish to see the matter to conclusion, and, as referred to above, in my view, taken in context of the overall costs of the proceedings to date, the additional costs should be relatively limited.
I accept that there is a risk that the delay and the need to apply for further funding may cause the funder to revisit the merits, but that would not be as a result of what has given rise to the application to adjourn.  The risk is not enough to persuade me that the claimants will suffer irremediable prejudice should an application to adjourn be granted.  As to the multiple, I accept that the period is extended; although, as I have already said, the risk is unchanged.  The precise impact is unknown, given that the claimants understandably do not wish to give further details and have had little time to consider this issue given the imminence of the trial and the need for this application to be resolved quickly.  As to the additional ATE premium, the need for this is also unknown as is the amount involved.  Whilst therefore I do not discount it, it is again not enough to persuade me that the claimants will suffer irremediable prejudice.
Conclusion
Even if the claimants may (or will) suffer irremediable prejudice on an adjournment by reason of the funding implications, on the authorities referred to above, “uncompensatable injustice to the other party may be a ground for refusing an adjournment” [emphasis added] but does not require the Court to refuse an adjournment. In deciding whether to adjourn the trial, the Court must have regard to the overriding objective.  It is extremely unfortunate that leading counsel has been taken ill at such a late stage but, as has been recognised, this is not the fault of either party.  I am extremely reluctant to adjourn such a substantial trial, given the matters referred to above.  However, our legal system is based on the oral presentation of evidence and submissions.  Cross-examination plays a very significant role in our legal system in enabling the court to receive the best evidence from witnesses.  Cross-examination of witnesses requires skill and extensive preparation.
Weighing the conflicting considerations discussed above, I find that in the circumstances, the defendant could not have a fair trial on the current trial timetable or within the current trial window and, on balance, I find that the prejudice to the defendant in refusing an adjournment outweighs the other factors.  I am not persuaded that the unfairness to the defendant is outweighed by any potential prejudice which may accrue to the claimants, and although I accept the potential funding implications for the claimants which may result from an adjournment, in my view, the balance in this case lies in granting the application to adjourn the trial.

HIS HONOUR JUDGE JARMAN KC
HHJ JARMAN KC:
By a Part 20 claim dated 4 July 2024, the Part 20 claimant, Mr Proctor, brings claims against the Part 20 defendant, Mr Jones, in debt and in restitution. These claims are made in litigation commenced by the claimant, Mr McCarthy, against Mr Proctor, following on from a judgment which I handed down in August 2022 in previous litigation between Mr Jones and Mr McCarthy. In that judgment, I held that Mr McCarthy was liable to pay to Mr Jones damages in the sum of €1,025,000 for breach of an agreement to sell to Mr Jones rights in a villa in Mallorca. In doing so, I rejected Mr McCarthy’s defence that Mr Jones had transferred his rights in the villa to Mr Proctor in or around 2010, and that Mr Proctor had then sold the beneficial ownership back to Mr McCarthy in or around May 2016 for €950,000. Accordingly, my finding was that Mr McCarthy had not been entitled, as he claimed, then to sell the villa to a third party and to retain the proceeds. Mr Proctor was not a party or a witness in those proceedings and accordingly is not bound by those findings, with which he disagrees.
Mr Jones on 23 July 2024 filed an acknowledgement of service indicating an intention of defending all of Mr Proctor’s claims against him but has not entered a defence. Instead, by an application dated 6 August 2024 Mr Jones applies to strike out Mr Proctor’s claims against him, on the basis that these are barred by the Limitation Act 1980. Under CPR 3.4(2) the court has power to strike out a statement of case if it (a) discloses no reasonable grounds for bringing a claim or (b) is an abuse of the court’s process or is otherwise likely to obstruct the just disposal of the proceedings. Pursuant to CPR 24.3 the court may give summary judgment against a claimant on the whole of the claim or on an issue if (a) it considers that the claimant has no real prospect of succeeding on the claim or issue and (b) there is no other compelling reason why the case or issue should be disposed of at trial.
In his claim against Mr Jones, Mr Proctor pleads that by 2010 he acquired an apartment in Dubai together with Mr Jones, which was held in the former’s name but with the latter owning a beneficial interest. Mr Proctor further pleads that by an oral agreement in 2011 to which he, Mr Jones and Mr McCarthy were parties, Mr Proctor agreed to transfer his beneficial interest in the Dubai apartment, which interest was valued at €520,949, and Mr Jones agreed to owe Mr Proctor that sum, and to secure that debt on his beneficial interest in the villa, or alternatively, to transfer title to his beneficial interest in the villa to Mr Proctor as security. The claim continues that the debt increased when from 2011 Mr Jones did not make monthly repayments of the mortgage secured on the villa as agreed, and Mr Proctor paid these and other expenses. Mr Proctor pleads that Mr Jones agreed that these sums should be added to the original debt, making a total of €1,076,101.00 with interest as at the end of March 2016. The date on which this further agreement was made is not pleaded, other than to say it was before the end of March 2016.  Mr Proctor claims that when none of this was paid he exercised his security and sold the villa to Mr McCarthy for €950,000, which he applied to reduce Mr Jones’ debt to €144,273. He claims this sum with interest.
Mr Proctor has indicated that he will give credit for the €950,000 which he received from Mr McCarthy in respect of the villa; but only if he successfully defends Mr McCarthy’s claim in the main proceedings. His claim in restitution arises only if Mr McCarthy’s claim against him succeeds. He puts this on the basis that he applied the €950,000 which he received from Mr McCarthy in respect of the villa towards Mr Jones’ debt, which enriched Mr Jones at Mr Proctor’s expense, and did so without realising that his sale of the rights in the villa to Mr McCarthy might have been invalid, as Mr McCarthy contends in the main action. He pleads that the basis of such application of the €950,000 was the validity of his sale of the rights in the villa to Mr McCarthy, and if that sale is invalid, that basis has failed.
Mr Jones’ application was made under CPR 3.4(2)(a), supported by a witness statement of his solicitor. The basis of the application was set out in it and in the supporting witness statement, and that was that each of the claims brought by Mr Proctor against Mr Jones is time barred. Particulars were given, which may be summarised as follows. The debt is in respect of Mr Jones’ acquisition of Mr Proctor’s beneficial interest in the Dubai apartment in 2010. Any claim for unpaid sums in relation thereto would have accrued at the time of the acquisition in 2010 (said to be March or May). The limitation period for this claim expired in May 2016 at the latest.The mortgage payments relied on by Mr Proctor to base his further debt claim are said to have been made between 2011 and 2016. Any claim for unpaid sums in relation to those payments would have accrued by 2016, at the latest, and so the limitation period expired in May 2022 at the latest. The claim for restitution relates to the reduction by Mr Proctor of these debts, which reduction is said to have been made in May 2016, and so the limitation period for the alleged restitution claim expired in May 2022.
Several consent orders were made in the application dealing amongst other matters with filing of evidence and the listing of the application. Mr Proctor’s solicitor has also filed a witness statement. In Mr Wassouf’s skeleton argument dated 11 December on behalf of Mr Proctor opposing the strike out application, he took the point that it is well-established that if limitation is the sole basis for an application to strike out under CPR 3.4(2)(a), the application will be dismissed, relying on Baroness Lawrence of Clarendon OBE v Associated Newspapers Limited [2023] EWHC 2789 (KB), at [74]. Mr Campbell, for Mr Jones, in a supplemental skeleton argument filed on 12 December, conceded that point, but says the same test applies for granting summary judgment against Mr Proctor.  As an alternative, he orally applied at the start of the hearing for permission to amend the application to rely also on CPR 3.4(2)(b). That was opposed and I heard each counsel on this point. It was agreed at the hearing that the application to amend would be dealt with in this judgment rather than at the outset of the hearing.
Mr Campbell properly acknowledges that for the purpose of the strike out application, the facts and matters pleaded by Mr Proctor against Mr Jones are assumed to be correct, whilst making no admissions as to the facts or their legal effect. Mr Campbell in his supplementary skeleton argument and in oral submissions put forward several reasons why he says the amendment to the application should be allowed.
Both counsel referred me to several authorities. Mr Campbell accepts that what was said in Ronex Properties Ltd v John Laing Construction Ltd [1983] QB 398 applies here to the application under CPR 3.4(2)(a). At 404D-E, Donaldson LJ said:
“Authority apart, I would have thought that it was absurd to contend that a writ or third-party notice could be struck out as disclosing no cause of action, merely because the defendant may have a defence under the Limitation Acts. Whilst it is possible to have a contractual provision whereby the effluxion of time eliminates a cause of action and there are some provisions of foreign law which can have that effect, it is trite law that the English Limitation Acts bar the remedy and not the right; and furthermore that they do not even have this effect unless and until pleaded. Even when pleaded, they are subject to various exceptions, such as acknowledgment of a debt or concealed fraud which can be raised by way of reply.”
At 404E-G, Donaldson LJ continued:
“The matter is not in fact free from authority. It was considered in Riches v. Director of Public Prosecutions, (1973) 1 Weekly Law Reports, 1019, in which the earlier cases are reviewed. There the grounds put forward in support of the application to strike out included an allegation that the claim was frivolous and vexatious and an abuse of the process of the court. Accordingly, the court was able to consider evidence and it is understandable that the claim could be struck out.”
And at 405A-B:
“Where it is thought to be clear that there is a defence under the Limitation Act, the defendant can either plead that defence and seek the trial of a preliminary issue or, in a very clear case, he can seek to strike out the claim upon the ground that it is frivolous, vexatious and an abuse of the process of the court and support his application with evidence. But in no circumstances can he seek to strike out on the ground that no cause of action is disclosed.”
Agreeing, Sir Sebag Shaw said at 407H-408B:
“As to striking out a writ or other initiating process on the ground that it discloses no reasonable cause of action, I would regard this power as properly exercisable only when it is manifest that there is an answer immediately destructive of whatever claim to relief is made, and that such answer can and will be effectively made. In such a case it would, as I understand Lord Justice Stephenson will observe in the course of his judgment, be a waste of time and money to allow the matter to be pursued so as to give rise to what would be an abuse of the process of the court”.
Stephenson LJ did then so observe at 408B-D:
“There are many cases in which the expiry of the limitation period makes it a waste of time and money to let a plaintiff go on with his action. But in those cases it may be impossible to say that he has no reasonable cause of action. The right course is therefore for a defendant to apply to strike out his claim as frivolous and vexatious and an abuse of the process of the court, on the ground that it is statute-barred. Then the plaintiff and the court know that the Statute of Limitation will be pleaded, the defendant can, if necessary, file evidence to that effect, the plaintiff can file evidence of an acknowledgment or concealed fraud or any matter which may show the court that his claim is not vexatious or an abuse of process and the court will be able to do in, I suspect most cases, what was done in Riches v. Director of Public Prosecutions, strike out the claim and dismiss the action.”
In Baroness Lawrence, Nicklin Jreferred to that case and saidat [75]:
“Ronex recognises, at least in theory, that, if the claimant has no answer to an obviously well-founded limitation defence, the Court has jurisdiction to strike out the claim under what is now CPR 3.4(2)(b), but the more obvious route of challenge is a summary judgment application under CPR Part 24. I find it difficult to imagine circumstances in which a challenge based on limitation would have a different outcome depending on whether it was made under CPR 3.4(2)(b) or Part 24.”
Mr Campbell points out that in the present case, Mr Jones has adduced evidence that limitation points are or will be taken in respect each of Mr Proctor’s claims and the basis for doing so. Mr Proctor has responded with evidence as to why it is said that those points do not apply, including reliance upon acknowledgment and part payment on the part of Mr Jones, mistake, and that the agreements relied upon by Mr Proctor may be governed by Dubai law, which is said to have a more relaxed regime on limitation. Mr Campbell accordingly submits that the amendment he seeks relies on an additional CPR sub-rule and does not introduce any new points of substance, so there would be no unfairness in allowing the amendment. The alternatives are either that Mr Jones will make a fresh application based on the same evidence and arguments, or that Mr Jones will plead to a case which, as is clear, Mr Proctor no longer contends for. In particular, as to Mr Proctor’s reliance, in opposing the strike out application, on Dubai law, no foreign law is pleaded against Mr Jones, and indeed Spanish law is pleaded as the applicable law by Mr Proctor in his defence to the main claim. The objection now relied on by Mr Proctor was not foreshadowed in correspondence or evidence prior to exchange of skeleton arguments but instead Mr Proctor has engaged with the substance of the application and has also failed to set out amendments to his pleadings to reflect his evidence on this application.
As for the tests to be applied,Coulson LJ in Begum v Maran (UK) Ltd [2021] EWCA Civ 326 at [20-21] referred to the test for exercising such powers:
The Appellant's application before the judge sought an order pursuant to r.3.4(2)(a) that the particulars of claim disclosed ""no reasonable grounds"" for bringing the claim and should be struck out and, in the alternative, a claim for summary judgment pursuant to r.24.2(a)(i) that the Respondent had no real prospect of succeeding on the claim. There can sometimes be procedural consequences if applications are made under the 'wrong' rule (which do not arise here) but, in a case like this (where the striking-out is based on the nature of the pleading, not a failure to comply with an order), there is no difference between the tests to be applied by the court under the two rules.”
Accordingly, I do not agree with the judge's observation at [4] that somehow the test under r.24.2 is ""less onerous from a defendant's perspective"". In a case of this kind, the rules should be taken together, and a common test applied. If a defendant is entitled to summary judgment because the claimant has no realistic prospect of success, then the statement of claim discloses no reasonable grounds for bringing the claim and should be struck out: see Global Asset Capital Inc v Aabar Block SARL [2017] EWCA Civ 37 ; [2017] 4 WLR 16 at [27].”
Accordingly, Mr Campbell submits that the test is the same as that for summary judgment. The principles relating to summary judgment were set out by Lewison J, as he then was, in EasyAir Ltd v Opal Telecom Ltd [2009] EWHC 339 (Ch) at [15]. They may be summarised for present purpose as follows, so far as material. The court must be careful before giving summary judgment on a claim and must consider whether the claimant has a realistic, as opposed to a fanciful, chance of success, which is whether the claim is one that carries some degree of conviction and is more than merely arguable. The court must not conduct a mini-trial but must take into account not only the evidence actually placed before it on the application for summary judgment, but also evidence that can reasonably be expected to be available at trial.  On the other hand it is not uncommon for an application under Part 24 to give rise to a short point of law or construction and, if the court is satisfied that it has before it all the evidence necessary for the proper determination of the question and that the parties have had an adequate opportunity to address it in argument, it should grasp the nettle and decide it. It is not enough simply to argue that the case should be allowed to go to trial because something may turn up which would have a bearing on the question of construction. Those principles were applied by HHJ Saffman, sitting as a judge of the High Court, in Dixon v Santander Asset Finance Plc [2021] EWHC 1044 (Ch).
Mr Campbell submits that those principles should be applied in this case and that the issues of limitation here are shorts points of law which can and should be appropriately resolved on the evidence, given that the facts as pleaded by Mr Proctor are assumed for present purposes to be correct.
Mr Wassouf also filed and served a supplementary skeleton argument dated 13 December 2024, in which he opposed any reliance on CPR 3.4(2)(b). In this and in his oral submissions, he submits that this proposes a fundamental change in the nature of the application facing Mr Proctor and requires consideration of whether the claim is an abuse of the court’s process, which is a different test to the one raised by CPR 3.4(2)(a). He further submits that Mr Proctor may well have adduced different evidence on the issue of abuse, and as a matter of fairness if the court proceeds to deal with this issue it must proceed on the basis that it does not have the full evidence before it.
He also objects to the court treating the application as one for summary judgment, and points out that CPR 24.4(5) and 24.5 contain very specific requirements for the making of applications for summary judgment, including that parties must be given at least 14 days’ notice of a hearing on summary judgment (CPR 24.4(5)); that an application for summary judgment must state as such on its face (CPR 24.5(a)); that there should be written evidence in support of it (CPR 24.5(c)); and that it should make other confirmations set out at CPR 24.5(d)-(f).   He accepts that in exceptional cases, the court may treat an application for strike out as if it were made under Part 24 even though the requirements of that rule have not been complied with but submits that the court should be very slow to pursue that course.  He cites Chief Master Marsh in Saeed v Ibrahim [2018] EWHC 3 (Ch) at [9] as follows:
“…the court should be slow to waive the express requirements of Part 24 and practice direction 24 and should proceed with the overriding objective firmly in mind… the respondent to an application is entitled to notice of the case that is to be put forward and to have a proper opportunity to prepare for the hearing with knowledge of the basis upon which it is said the court should summarily dispose of the claim.”
I accept that the court should be slow to waive express requirements of CPR 24 and should keep the overriding objective firmly in mind, especially, in this case, fairness and proportionality.
In my judgment it is fair and proportionate on this strike out application for the court to consider and if appropriate apply CPR 3.4(2)(b) and CPR 24, for the following reasons:
The strike out application was made as long ago as 6 August 2024 together with supporting witness evidence.
Although reference was then made only to CPR 3.4(2)(a), the basis of the application was put on a clear basis, namely that Mr Proctor’s claims are time barred for the detailed reasons then given.
That is the same basis relied upon in support of CPR 3.4(2)(b) (albeit in the context of abuse rather than lack of a reasonable cause of action) and in seeking summary judgment. In each case it must be assumed for these purposes that the facts set out by Mr Proctor in his claim are correct.
The application and supporting evidence have allowed Mr Proctor to raise in his evidence and argument issues such as acknowledgement, part payment, mistake and the applicability of Dubai law. Although Mr Wassouf submits that further evidence may have been adduced on issues of abuse of process and summary judgment, none was identified and it is very difficult to see what this may be, given that the basis remains the same. It is not appropriate to wait to see if something turns up.
Mr Campbell relies on no further points in his supplemental skeleton argument or in oral submissions (other than the procedural points arising on his application to amend) than contained in his original skeleton argument.
Although there was exchange of witness statements and correspondence between the parties’ solicitors which engaged with the limitation points, the first procedural objection to the application on the basis of CPR 3.4(2)(a) was in Mr Wassouf’s skeleton argument dated 11 December.
The limitation points in my judgment are short points of law.
With that, I now turn to consider the limitation points. Apart from the reference to Dubai law, which I shall deal with in due course, it was not positively asserted by Mr Wassouf that the primary limitation periods have not expired. Instead, he relies on exceptions set out in the 1980 Act. The time limit for actions founded on simple contract is set out in section 5:
“An action founded on simple contract shall not be brought after the expiration of six years from the date on which the cause of action accrued”.
Acknowledgement or part payment are dealt with in sections 29 and 30:
“
29
…
Subject to subsection (6) below, where any right of action has accrued to recover—
any debt or other liquidated pecuniary claim; or
any claim to the personal estate of a deceased person or to any share or interest in any such estate;
and the person liable or accountable for the claim acknowledges the claim or makes any payment in respect of it the right shall be treated as having accrued on and not before the date of the acknowledgment or payment.
…
subject to subsection (6) above, a current period of limitation may be repeatedly extended under this section by further acknowledgments or payments, but a right of action, once barred by this Act, shall not be revived by any subsequent acknowledgment or payment.
30 Formal provisions as to acknowledgments and part payments.
To be effective for the purposes of section 29 of this Act, an acknowledgment must be in writing and signed by the person making it.
For the purposes of section 29, any acknowledgment or payment—
may be made by the agent of the person by whom it is required to be made under that section; and
shall be made to the person, or to an agent of the person, whose title or claim is being acknowledged or, as the case may be, in respect of whose claim the payment is being made.”
Where the action is for relief from the consequences of a mistake, section 32 provides:
“32 Postponement of limitation period in case of fraud, concealment or mistake.
…where in the case of any action for which a period of limitation is prescribed by this Act, either—
the action is based upon the fraud of the defendant; or
any fact relevant to the plaintiff’s right of action has been deliberately concealed from him by the defendant; or
the action is for relief from the consequences of a mistake;
the period of limitation shall not begin to run until the plaintiff has discovered the fraud, concealment or mistake (as the case may be) or could with reasonable diligence have discovered it.
References in this subsection to the defendant include references to the defendant’s agent and to any person through whom the defendant claims and his agent.”
Mr Proctor relies on several acknowledgments by Mr Jones of the debt and there are issues as to whether these amount to acknowledgments within the meaning of section 29 of the 1980 Act. As section 29(7) makes clear, an acknowledgment may extend the limitation period, but cannot revive a right of action once barred.
One such acknowledgment is an email on 14 March 2016 from Mr Jones in reply to an earlier email that day of Mr Proctor to him. Mr Proctor’s email says, referring to the villa as 22 and the Dubai apartment as Saber:
“Hi Al. Macarthy called to say he wants the mortgage on 22 payed off as he is buying a house in Mallorca .
As u are aware u owe me £500k on Saber and approx 300k€ spent on 22
the only option is for u to pay the mortgage off. Can u let me know if there is any other way
Brian”
Mr Jones’ reply says:
“Hi Bri.
The short answer is I need to sell the place. Otherwise, redeem the mortgage which would mean another mortgage to take this one out.
I am away now but will be back in Cardiff on Thursday. Will have a look at the options then.
Anyway we need to reconcile where you and I are with this. This is long overdue so I will have Andy pull everything together before I head for Dubai on Friday night.
Al”
Mr Proctor says that this reply by Mr Jones amounts, or arguably amounts, to an acknowledgment of his indebtedness to Mr Proctor. Mr Jones disputes that and says that hisremark that he needed to sell the villa was in response to Mr Proctor’s statement that Mr McCarthy wanted the mortgage on the villa paid off. Mr Campbell relies upon Good v Parry [1963] 2 QB 418, where Lord Denning giving the lead judgment in the Court of Appeal, dealt with whether a letter amounted to an acknowledgment of rent due for the purposes of the predecessor of the 1980 Act, and said at 424:
“I come back to the sentence in this case…which means “there may be some rent out-standing and it can be the subject of an agreement as soon as you present your account.” Such being the meaning of it, I am quite satisfied that there is no acknowledgment, because there is no admission of any rent of a defined amount due, or of any amount that can be ascertained by calculation. The amount is uncertain altogether. Nor can I regard it as a promise to pay whatever amount may be due on taking an account. The tenant clearly reserves the right to examine it and not be bound except by separate agreement.”
In my judgment, those observations apply neatly to the March 2016 email. Even if, which is doubtful, Mr Jones thereby accepts that something may be owing, there is no admission of a defined amount or of any that can be ascertained by calculation. Mr Jones’ reference to the need for reconciliation is not a promise to pay whatever amount may be due on such reconciliation, except by separate agreement.
Other acknowledgments relied on relate to oral statements in cross examination made in July 2022. However those were clearly not made to Mr Proctor or his agent. It is also said that further acknowledgments were made in correspondence in 2023, but no particulars are given and the correspondence is not produced. Moreover, the debt is said to have arisen by the end of March 2016 and so even if these are acknowledgments, they will not avail Mr Proctor, as there were made after the limitation period had run. There is no realistic prospect that acknowledgements will be established which have the effect of extending the limitation periods for the purposes of the 1980 Act.
As for part payment by Mr Jones, Mr Proctor says that in May 2016 he told Mr Jones that he would apply the €950,000 proceeds of sale of the villa to the debt and Mr Jones did not object. Mr Wassouf submits that on those facts, Mr Jones ought to be taken to have made part payment such that the limitation period renews pursuant to section 29(5) of the 1980 Act. He relies on Surrendra Overseas Ltd v Government of Sri Lanka [1977] 1 WLR 565, at 577.
In response, Mr Campbell submits that any such application of the €950,000 received from Mr McCarthy towards the debt, was not a payment within the meaning of section 29(5), because such must be made by the debtor (or under section 30(2) by their agent). It is not suggested that Mr Proctor was acting as Mr Jones’ agent in this regard and could not realistically be so suggested. Any acquiescence on Mr Jones’s part cannot retrospectively change that fact. Mr Campbell points out that in Surrendra, no part payment was found. Kerr J, as he then was, at 576 said:
“A part-payment, like an acknowledgment, can only revive the cause of action and start time running afresh if it provides evidence in the form of an admission by the debtor that the debt remains due despite the passage of time. This is consonant with the authorities. In Cottam v. Partridge (1842) 4 Man. & G. 271  280 the doctrine of part-payment was in my view correctly described in the argument as “payment of money in part-payment of the whole debt, which is an acknowledgment of a debt being due, not in words, but by an act done.” Tindal C.J. said, at p. 287: ”
“The ground on which part-payment was previously held to take the case out of [the Limitation Act 1623 ] was, that a payment of a part was an admission of the rest by inference, and that, from such payment, a jury might conclude that the rest was due.” ”
In my judgment, the act done in this case was an act by Mr Proctor and not by Mr Jones. Silence on the latter’s part cannot render an act of Mr Proctor an act of Mr Jones for the purposes of determining whether there was part payment by him within the meaning of the 1980 Act. There is no realistic prospect of Mr Proctor succeeding on this ground.
The next point taken on his behalf is that his claims are for the relief from the consequences of a mistake within the meaning of section 32(2)(c) of the 1980 Act so that time would not begin to run until Mr Proctor discovered the mistake or could have with reasonable diligence, discovered it. Mr Wassouf realistically accepts that for this point to succeed, mistake must be an element of the cause of action, and further accepts that Mr Proctor’s claim in restitution is premised upon a failure of basis. Nevertheless, he submits that that claim is based on a mistake as to the beneficial rights in the villa.
In response Mr Campbell submits that it is not enough that there is a mistake in the background, it must be an element of the cause of action. He relies upon Test Claimants in the FII Group Litigation v HMRC [2012] UKSC 19; [2012] 2 AC 337. Mr Proctor’s claim is not that he did not intend to transfer the villa to Mr McCarthy, but that he did so on a basis which did not in the event, on his case, transpire. I accept that submission, but even if there is a realistic prospect of reliance upon a mistake, the next question is whether and when Mr Proctor discovered the mistake or could have with reasonable diligence have discovered it.
In May 2016 there were further email exchanges between Mr Jones and Mr Proctor. Mr Campbell submits that Mr Jones clearly thereby told Mr Proctor that the villa was not Mr McCarthy’s to sell, so any mistake was then discovered. Mr Wassouf submits that the proper construction of the emails was that Mr Jones was annoyed at the price agreed. The chain, in which both discuss the villa, the Dubai apartment and what was owed, included the following from Mr Jones on 6 May which refers to the villa:
“This was never your house to sell from under me. The POA was put in your name to protect me against McCarthy which in turn was always going to protect your interest. McCarthy might be comfortable at €950k but I am not. The deal which we agreed was €1m and nothing less.”
The exchange continued and on 9 May Mr Jones wrote “My thinking is that everything is up for discussion but it does revolve around my retaining the equity in no 22.” By 15 December 2017 that year Mr Proctor instructed solicitors who wrote to Mr Jones demanding that the debt be repaid. Mr Jones wrote back in response saying that it was helpful that Mr Proctor acknowledged that the villa was owned by him, Mr Jones. He also stated that during a recent meeting Mr Proctor had acknowledged owing him money. The letter continued with a request for documents showing Mr Proctor’s authority to sell the villa to Mr McCarthy, and by saying that without documentation he had no proposal to pay. It is not suggested by Mr Proctor that there was such documentation.
Mr Campbell submits that it is clear from the emails, with or without the December 2017 letter, that Mr Jones was disputing any debt and also disputing that the villa had been validly transferred to Mr McCarthy. At the least this was sufficient to show that by December 2017 at the latest Mr Proctor could, with reasonable diligence, have discovered the mistake upon which he now seeks to rely, that he had the right to transfer the villa.
I accept those submissions. In my judgment there is no realistic prospect of Mr Proctor establishing that his claims include relief from the consequence of mistake, or that he could not with reasonable diligence have discovered the mistake by December 2017 and that even with such a mistake, his claim was barred by December 2023.
All of this is as nothing if Mr Proctor has a realistic prospect of establishing that that his claims are governed by the laws of Dubai, where he says that the relevant limitation period is one of 15 years and that provisions in relation to such matters as acknowledgment are more lax than in England and Wales. Such a contention is not as straightforward as the other exceptions relied upon by Mr Proctor, as dealt with above, and has a somewhat curious background in these proceedings. At one point Mr Jones was asserting that Mr Proctor’s claims were governed by Dubai law. In his defence in the main proceedings, Mr Proctor pleads that Spanish law is the appropriate law and does not plead otherwise in his particulars of claim against Mr Jones. He only asserts otherwise in the witness statements filed in this application. Mr Jones now says that Spanish law is appropriate.
The Supreme Court confirmed in FS Cairo (Nile Plaza) LLC v Brownlie [2021] UKSC 45; [2022] AC  995 that each party may (but is not obliged to) choose whether to plead a case that a foreign system of law is applicable to the claim. If neither party does choose the court will apply its own law to the issues in dispute. The parties are entitled, if they choose, simply to rely on the presumption that the foreign law is materially similar to English and Welsh law. If that default rule does not apply to the present proceedings, Mr Campbell submits that Spanish law would govern the debt claim which is founded on the 2011 agreement, which Mr Proctor pleads in his particulars of claim was an oral agreement, and there is no suggestion that the agreement identified the governing law.
Accordingly, Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 593/2008 (Rome I) applies, which materially provides:
To the extent that the law applicable to the contract has not been chosen in accordance with Article 3 and without prejudice to Articles 5 to 8, the law governing the contract shall be determined as follows: […]
a contract relating to a right in rem in immovable property or to a tenancy of immovable property shall be governed by the law of the country where the property is situated […]
Where the contract is not covered by paragraph 1 or where the elements of the contract would be covered by more than one of points (a) to (h) of paragraph 1, the contract shall be governed by the law of the country where the party required to effect the characteristic performance of the contract has his habitual residence.
Where it is clear from all the circumstances of the case that the contract is manifestly more closely connected with a country other than that indicated in paragraphs 1 or 2, the law of that other country shall apply.
Where the law applicable cannot be determined pursuant to paragraphs 1 or 2, the contract shall be governed by the law of the country with which it is most closely connected.”
On Mr Proctor’s pleaded case, by the 2011 agreement essentially Mr Jones agreed to acquire Mr Proctor’s beneficial interest in the Dubai apartment and to transfer his rights in the villa to Mr Proctor, or, alternatively, to grant him security over the same; and to make the mortgage repayments in respect of the villa. Mr Proctor pleads that as part of this agreement Mr McCarthy agreed to hold the legal title to the villa, and that he, Mr Proctor, would apply any proceeds of sale to Mr Jones’ debt.
Mr Campbell submits that the 2011 agreement in relation to the Dubai apartment is a subsidiary part of the agreement which principally dealt with the villa. Mr McCarthy had no connection with Dubai, but the villa is the common link between all three parties. Article 4(2) of Rome I does not apply because the 2011 agreement does not have a characteristic performance, but is a multi-party agreement with several distinct obligations, so that it is not possible to isolate an obligation on one of the parties which is peculiar to the type of agreement in issue, or which marks the nature of the agreement: see  BRG Noal GP Sarl v Kowski [2022] EWHC 867 (Ch) at [61].
Mr Campbell also submits that Spain is the country most closely connected with the 2011 agreement because most of the obligations under the pleaded 2011 agreement related to the villa. The obligation which related to the Dubai apartment, that Mr Jones would acquire Mr Proctor’s interest in it, involved no continuing obligations. All continuing obligations related to the villa. Mr McCarthy has had no connection with the UAE. Although Mr Jones and Mr Proctor currently reside in Dubai, they both previously resided at various times in Mallorca.
Mr Wassouf submits that as the 2011 agreement related to the acquisition of an interest in the Dubai apartment, so Article 4(1)(c) of Rome I applies and the law of Dubai governs the agreement. There is currently disagreement in the witness statements as to whether that law would mean that the claims are time barred. However, assuming for present purposes that Dubai law is more favourable to Mr Proctor as he claims, the question remains whether there is a realistic prospect that such law will be held to govern the agreement. On that assumption, together with the assumption that the facts pleaded by Mr Proctor are correct, it is unlikely that any further evidence will come forward and this issue should be grappled with now.
The 2011 agreement concerned not just one property but two. I accept the submission that the majority of the obligations thereunder related to the villa, and that the continuing obligations all, or at least almost all, related to the villa. Both Mr Proctor and Mr Jones have at least some connections with Dubai and with Mallorca, but Mr McCarthy has none with Dubai. This is underlined by the fact that relevant discussions between the parties as to sums of money were expressed in Euros.
Mr Wassouf submits that it is arguable that Article 4(1)(c) of Rome I applies. However, in my judgment it is clear that the 2011 agreement as pleaded by Mr Proctor is manifestly more connected with Mallorca within the meaning of Article 4(3).  It would be a waste of time and money to allow Mr Proctor’s claims to proceed if none of them has a realistic prospect of success because of clear limitations defences on assumed facts. That is the case here in my judgment. It is fair and just to strike out his claims.
I am grateful to counsel for their thorough yet focused submissions. They helpfully indicated that any consequential matters which cannot be agreed can be dealt with on the basis of written submissions. A draft order should be filed within 14 days of hand down of this judgment, together with any such submissions if necessary.

THE LONDON BOROUGH OF LAMBETH COUNCIL

Representation:
For the Appellant The appellant as a litigant in Person.
For the First Respondent: Sonia Taylor in the written Response of 20 February 2024.
For the Second Respondent: Peter Lockley of Counsel.
The application of Regulation 12 (5) (d) of the EIR.
Decision: The appeal is Dismissed.
REASONS
Introduction:
This decision relates to an appeal brought under section 57 of the Freedom of Information Act 2000 (“FOIA”) against the decision notice of the Commissioner dated 12 December 2023 Ref. IC-244791 – Z9Q15 (“the DN”) which is a matter of public record.
Factual Background:
On the 13 April 2023 the Appellant wrote to London Borough of Lambeth Council
(“the Council”) making the following request for information under the FOIA:
“… . There is a small parcel of land by our property that appears to belong to the council. See attached highlighted in red. We have been speaking to the council about purchasing this garden since 2018, and directly with (name withheld) from the “valuations and strategic assets” team since August 2020.
I understand that the council is now applying for a planning preapplication for developing this bit of land before making it publicly available for sale. FOI: We would like to have sight of the preapplication information including drawings, since any proposal to this bit of land would affect us directly as the only property adjacent to this land is our house”.
On 17 May 2023, the Council refused to provide the requested information. It cited the following exceptions as its basis for doing so:
Regulation 12(5)(d) (confidentiality of proceedings),
Regulation 12(5)(e) (confidentiality of commercial or industrial information) and
Regulation 12(5)(f) of the EIR. (Interests of the information provider)
Following an internal review (after the Commissioner’s intervention) the Council wrote to the Appellant on 13 September 2023 and stated that it upheld its position.
The Appellant originally contacted the Commissioner on 13 July 2023 to complain about the way his request for information had been handled. The Commissioner considered he had to determine whether the Council had correctly relied on the exceptions it cited to withhold requested information from the complainant.
The Commissioner observed that pre-planning applications (pre-app) and advice are plans and activities defined under regulation 2(1)(c) of the EIR which will affect the elements of the environment outlined in regulation 2(1)(a) (the land, landscape, soil and so on) whether they proceed to full application or not. The requested information therefore falls within the definition of environmental information and the Council was therefore correct to treat this request under the EIR. There is no issue between the parties on this.
The Commissioner having viewed a copy of the withheld information, maintains it comprises of the pre-planning application, the public authority’s comments thereon, background information and the policies applied to the application.
The Commissioner identified two categories of requested information: (a) the broad tranche of pre-application information within the scope of the request, which was therefore exempted from provision by way of Regulation 12(5)(d); and (b) the much more narrow category of information comprising of background information and the policies applied to the pre-planning application which lacked the qualities needed for Regulation 12(5)(d) to apply.  The Commissioner therefore went on to consider whether Regulation 12(5)(e) might apply to that information and found that they could not have the necessary quality of confidence required for Regulation 12(5)(e) and that exemption could not apply.
The Commissioner decided in relation to the information within the scope of the request for which regulation 12(5)(d) is engaged and in all the circumstances, the public interest in maintaining the application of regulation 12(5)(d) outweighs the public interest in disclosure. Although the public authority (“the Council”) invites the Tribunal also to consider the exceptions under Regulation 12(5)(e) and Regulation 12(5)(f) of the EIR, the Appellant does not raise or engage these exceptions in his appeal and the Tribunal intend, without prejudice to the other exceptions to primarily restrict the issue in this appeal to the exception under Regulation 12(5)(d)
The Factual Background, Legal Framework, Grounds of Appeal and our Adjournment Notice and Interim Decision and Case Management Directions were issued in considerable detail by this Tribunal on 10 July 2024. The outcome of the Case Management Directions provided by this Tribunal at that hearing was that the Council was joined as the Second Respondent and what we regard as significant material evidence has since been ultimately provided for this oral hearing together with the significant assistance of Peter Lockley of Counsel representing the Council.
The Issues: Regulation 12(5)(d) – Confidentiality of proceedings.
Regulation 12(5)(d) of the EIR states that a public authority may refuse to disclose information to the extent that its disclosure would adversely affect the confidentiality of the proceedings of that or any other public authority where such confidentiality is provided by law. The engagement of the exception rests on three conditions being met.
Firstly, the confidentiality referred to by a public authority must specifically relate to the confidentiality of proceedings. In his guidance ‘Confidentiality of proceedings (regulation 12(5)(d)), the Commissioner interprets ‘proceedings’ as possessing a certain level of formality. They will include but are not limited to formal meetings to consider matters that are within the authority’s jurisdiction; situations where an authority is exercising its statutory decision-making powers; and legal proceedings.
Second, this confidentiality must be provided by law. The public authority has explained that it considers the information to meet the threshold for the common law duty of confidentiality. This is because the information is not trivial and was submitted to it voluntarily as part of the pre-application advice process.
Third, it must be demonstrated that disclosure would have an adverse effect on the confidentiality of the proceedings.
Finally, the Tribunal must consider the balance of the public interest as regards the information that engages the exception. In doing so, we must acknowledge the EIR’s express presumption in favour of disclosure and the public interest in transparency and accountability.
In his Grounds of appeal, the Appellant asserts this appeal relates solely on his challenge to the Commissioners’ reliance on regulation 12(5) (d) (confidentiality of proceedings) for the decision and suggests the same arguments would also apply to regulations 12(5) (e) and 12(5) (f). He sets out his substantive Grounds of appeal as follows:
Ground 1: The pre-application advice process is not a ‘proceeding’ for the purposes of reg. 12(5)(d);
Ground 2:  In any case, common law confidentiality cannot apply to any proceedings in which Lambeth is the applicant as well as the body determining the application; and
Ground 3: Disclosure in this case would not adversely affect confidentiality where it does exist, in relation to information supplied by third-party applicants.
Discussion:
Further to this Tribunals’ Directions issued on 10 July 2024 we now, helpfully and significantly have an updated open bundle in 188 pages. There is a closed bundle of 13 pages (which is the withheld information), an unredacted version of the advice letter which is in redacted form in the open bundle. There is an authorities bundle which consists of all of the authorities in the Second Respondents submissions and which we have considered herein. Included in the updated Bundle is a witness statement from Mr Robert O’Sullivan, who holds a Master’s degree in Regional and Urban Planning (MRUP) and who has 20 years’ experience as a planning professional in local government. He has been employed by Lambeth Council since October 2006 and has professional membership of the Royal Town Planning Institute (RTPI) and has been a chartered member since October 2008. His role at the London Borough of Lambeth (“Lambeth”) is Assistant Director of Development Management & Enforcement in Lambeth’s Planning Department (“the Planning Authority”). He has overall management responsibility for the delivery of all aspects of the Planning Authority’s development management and planning enforcement services. This includes oversight of the processing of all planning pre-applications and applications. We have also had the privilege and significant benefit of hearing Mr O’Sullivan providing further comprehensive and detailed material evidence in person at this oral hearing. We regard him as competent, able and forthright in providing material evidence with significant veracity.
The Evidence:
The following material facts are established from Mr O’Sullivan’s witness statement:
Pre-application planning advice is a service provided by Lambeth (in common with other local planning authorities), which allows “an applicant to 'test the waters' on the likely acceptability of a scheme and provide early indications of our view of a development.” [ROS/10, OB/E127; OB/E159]. Lambeth charges a fee for the service and requires applications to be submitted via a bespoke form available on its website. The form requires an applicant to provide considerable detail of the proposal and to sign a declaration which begins: “I/we the undersigned, request formal written advice from the council in respect of the proposed development described above” [ROS/15, OB/E128; OB/E163].
As the name suggests, the service provides non-binding advice and does not result in a final determination [ROS/7, OB/E125]. Pre-application planning advice and requests are not published, and no third-party views are sought by Lambeth: publicity and consultation are requirements of the planning application process itself, not the pre-application process, which is intended to allow developers to test and refine proposals with the local planning authority [ROS/17, OB/E128]. Although Lambeth encourages developers to engage with members of the community at pre-application stage where appropriate, this is at the discretion of the developer and is likely to be appropriate only for larger projects. Even then, there is no requirement to consult the public and a developer is entitled to test its proposals with Lambeth before making them public through the planning process itself [ROS/9, OB/E126; ROS/30, OB/E131].
The application form invites applicants to identify material which is commercially sensitive or considered to be confidential for some other reason, with reasons and dates by which it will cease to be confidential. [ROS/13-16, OB/E127-128].
If a planning application is submitted following the provision of pre-application advice, Lambeth’s default position is that pre-application documents will be available on request to those wishing to comment on the application – although it will apply that position flexibly, taking into account any requests for continuing confidentiality that the developer may make [ROS/17, OB/E128].
The Appellant lives in Lambeth. A small parcel of undeveloped land (“the Site”) owned by Lambeth adjoins the property in which he lives. He has been engaged in discussions with Lambeth for several years about a potential purchase of the Site. For its part, Lambeth is exploring the possibility of developing the Site, which will affect its value if Lambeth chooses to dispose of it [ROS/28, OB/E131].
On 23 January 2023, acting through its agent SW Architecture, Lambeth sought pre-application advice from the relevant department of Lambeth Council (“the Planning Authority”) in relation to potential development of the Site. On 16 March 2023, a senior planner acting on behalf of the Planning Authority wrote to SW Architecture, providing pre-application advice as requested (“the AdviceLetter”) [CB/A1-11].
In correspondence with Lambeth on 6 April 2023, the Appellant indicated that he would make an information request for the pre-application proposals. The Lambeth Officer acting as applicant in this case forwarded this e-mail the same day to the senior planner in the Planning Authority, seeking confirmation that the pre-application advice was confidential. She noted that she was content for the advice to be made public following any planning application [ROS/24-25, OB/E130].
Were Lambeth in due course to submit a planning application, it would be acting in a dual but distinct roles as both applicant of the proposed development, and as the relevant planning authority determining that application. The legal basis for such a dual role is provided by reg. 3 of the Town and Country Planning General Regulations 1992 (“the 1992 Regulations”).
Further Legal Considerations on the Legal background:
Reg. 12(5)(d) EIR (confidentiality of proceedings)
There is no definition of ‘proceedings’ within the Regulations. In accordance with its natural meaning, the Tribunal has given the term a reasonably broad scope. For instance, it has been held to encompass meetings of a public authority: Archer & IC v and Salisbury DC (EA/2006/0037, IT, 9 May 2007) at para. 68, or even a particular item of business taken in closed session at a local authority meeting (the meeting being the ‘proceeding’ for the purposes of reg. 12(5)(d)): Chichester DC v IC and Friel [2012] UKUT 491 (AAC) at paras, 16-19. It can also encompass the preparation of a report that is required prior to certain disciplinary proceedings against local authority staff: Turner v IC and Cheshire East BC (EA/2014/0009, FTT, 10 December 2013).
In Flachglas Torgau v Germany (Case C-204/09) [2013] QB 212, the Court of Justice of the European Union (“CJEU”) considered the concept of ‘proceedings’ as referred to in Art. 4(2)(a) of the Directive (which is directly transposed by EIR reg.12(5)(b)). It noted that the concept was one for the national court to determine (paras. 63, -65), albeit commenting obiter (at para.63) that proceedings ‘refers to the final stages of the decision-making process of public authorities.
In Department for the Economy (Northern Ireland) v IC and White (GIA/85/2021), the Upper Tribunal cited Flachgas and held (at para.31, emphasis added) that:
“The scope of 'proceedings' is not defined. However, I consider that the term must broadly apply to the final decision-making stages of an authority”.
The Upper Tribunal in White held that this definition could encompass internal decision-making by a government department in relation to litigation, on the basis that such decisions amounted to the department’s own ‘proceedings’, involving as they did consideration of evidence and legal advice:
“…In the particular circumstances, the [Department] and TRUK were engaged in legal proceedings, which were not in themselves the proceedings of the [Department] as they fell to be determined by the High Court. However, in the course of the legal proceedings, the appellants had to make their own decisions about how those proceedings should be conducted…it appears to me that the decisions taken by the [Department] about their conduct of the legal proceedings potentially falls within the scope of their own regulation 12(5)(d) 'proceedings'. This is because their own conduct of the litigation required formal decision-making steps and consideration of evidence and legal advice. I consider that the FTT has erred by holding otherwise […]”
The FTT in Mark Jopling Obo Udney Park Playing Fields Trust Limited v IC & London Borough of Richmond [2024] UKFTT 00163 (GRC) (“the Jopling decision”) has subsequently relied on the White decision to hold that pre-application advice does not constitute a ‘proceeding’ for the purposes of reg. 12(5)(d) EIR (paras. 16-17). Lambeth argues below that Jopling wrongly applies White and that this Tribunal should respectfully decline to follow it.
The CJEU in Flachgas also considered the requirement for the confidentiality of proceedings to be provided by law. It held that on established Treaty principles, there was no need for Member States to enact specific legislation to establish the confidentiality of proceedings (¶60). Although the wording of Art. 4(2)(a) required ‘an express provision to exist in national law with a precisely defined scope, and not merely a general legal context’ (¶61), the CJEU went on to qualify this requirement:
“62 However, that specification cannot be interpreted as requiring all the conditions for application of that ground for refusing access to environmental information to be determined in detail since, by their very nature, decisions taken in that domain are heavily dependent on the actual context in which they are adopted and necessitate an assessment of the nature of the documents in question and the stage of the administrative procedure at which the request for information is made (see, by analogy, Commission v France, paragraphs 81 and 82)”.
The common law rules that provide for a duty of confidence on the recipient of information in defined circumstances meet the requirements of Flachgas. They form a body of law that is clear and precise, but flexible enough to meet the requirements of the individual case. As recognised by the CJEU in Commission v France, Case (C-233/00) (to which the Court referred in Flachgas at para. 62 above), compliance with an article of the predecessor to Directive 2003/04/EC could be ensured ‘when it is applied in practice to a specific situation’, by means of ‘concepts whose content is clear and precise, and which are applied in the framework of settled case-law’: Commission v France paras. 82-83, emphasis added.
The Second Respondent argues from the above, it follows that:
‘Proceedings’ encompass a wide variety of activities of public authorities, provided that they are engaged in the latter stages of decision-making; and
The confidentiality of those proceedings may be provided for either by statute, or by the common law.
The Second Respondent further argues:
that in considering the public interest in maintaining the exemption, a public authority is entitled to take into account the inherent interest in respecting any expectation of confidentiality that the person supplying the information may reasonably have had, the risk that disclosure would mean that similar information would be less likely to be provided in future, and any consequential prejudice to the public authority’s ability to carry out its functions: Wallis v IC and Derbyshire County Council (EA/2011/0219; 31 January 2012), and;
the Commissioner’s guidance on reg. 12(5)(f) accepts that in appropriate circumstances the relevant information may be supplied by a person who is themselves an agent of the relevant public authority – (the example given being an employee who provides information in relation to a disciplinary investigation).
The Second Respondent asserts the presumption in favour of disclosure is supported in Vesco v IC and Government Legal Department [2019] UKUT 247 (AAC), the UT considered the application of the reg. 12(2) presumption in favour of disclosure, by reference to earlier case law. At para. 19 it noted that: It was “common ground” in the case of Export Credits Guarantee Department v Friends of the Earth [2008] Env LR 40 at paragraph 24 that the presumption serves two purposes: (1) to provide the default position in the event that the interests are equally balanced and (2) to inform any decision that may be taken under the regulations.
The Second Respondent further asserts the presumption in favour of disclosure is supported by The Town and Country Planning General Regulations 1992. The 1992 Regulations provide a scheme by which ‘interested local planning authorities’ can make applications for planning permission for development on land in their area:
Subject to regulation 4, an application for planning permission by an interested planning authority to develop any land of that authority, or for development of any land by an interested planning authority or by an interested planning authority jointly with any other person, shall be determined by the authority concerned, unless the application is referred to the Secretary of State under section 77 of the [Town and Country Planning Act 1990] for determination by him.
Regulation 10 requires a degree of separation between the personnel making the application and those determining it:
Reg:10. Notwithstanding anything in section 101 of the Local Government Act 1972 (arrangements for the discharge of functions by local authorities) no application for planning permission for development to which regulation 3 applies may be determined :
by a committee or sub-committee of the interested planning authority concerned if that committee or sub-committee is responsible (wholly or partly) for the management of any land or buildings to which the application relates; or
by an officer of the interested planning authority concerned if his responsibilities include any aspect of the management of any land or buildings to which the application relates.
As the Court explained in R. (on the application of Cummins) v Camden LBC [2001] EWHC Admin 1116, “The purpose of the provision is to establish a decision-maker distanced from the interested committee, to dilute but not expunge its influence.” A dual purpose.
The 1992 Regulations have been considered by the Court in the context of access to information at principal local authority meetings, as governed by section 101A of the Local Government Act 1972 (“the 1972 Act”). Section 101A provides for the confidentiality of such proceedings. Insofar as material, it provides that such a meeting shall be open to the public unless excluded by resolution during an item of business whenever it is likely, in view of the nature of the business to be transacted or the nature of the proceedings, that if members of the public were present during that item there would be disclosure to them of ‘exempt information’, as defined in S.100I, read with Sch.12A to the 1972 Act, which includes:
Information relating to the financial or business affairs of any particular person (including the authority holding that information) […]
Information is not exempt information if it relates to proposed development for which the local planning authority may grant itself planning permission or permission in principle pursuant to regulation 3 of the Town and Country Planning General Regulations 1992
In R (on the application of Helen Stride) v Wiltshire Council [2022] EWHC 1476 (Admin), the question arose whether information relating to pre-application advice fell within para. 9 of Sch. 12A (so that it was not exempt), in circumstances where it would otherwise fall within para. 3 (so that it was exempt). The Court drew a clear distinction between the balance of competing interests underlying the legislative scheme before and after an application had been made (paras. 38-39,):
In my judgment, it assists in this case to have regard to the purpose of the statutory scheme, which is to promote public access on the one hand, but to safeguard the financial and business interests of anyone, including the authority, on the other. It is clear that in the interests of transparency, once the authority is applying for planning permission for development on its own land, then such safeguards should no longer apply, and the public should have access to relevant financial and business information.
In this case, the authority accepts that once that stage is reached, there must be public access to, and hence scrutiny of, such information before planning permission is granted. Given that that will happen, the question is whether in balancing the competing interests of public access and private interest, the purposes will be served by disclosure of such information when the proposals are at an early stage. In my judgment, it is not difficult to see why proposals may be prejudiced by the early disclosure of such information. […]”
The interplay between (i) these exemptions to the disclosure provisions under the 1972 Act and (ii) the application of EIR exemptions was considered by the Upper Tribunal in Lourenco v Information Commissioner & LB Barnet [2024] UKUT 111 (AAC), a case concerning pre-application planning information in the context of a putative application under the 1992 Regulations. The first ground of appeal was the Tribunal had erred in holding that it lacked jurisdiction to determine the application of the 1972 Act exemptions. Ultimately, the UT declined to rule on the precise scope of the Tribunal’s jurisdiction, because after citing the passage set out above from Stride, it held that the information before it related to an early stage of the planning process, and thus ‘plainly’ did not engage Sch. 12A para. 9 as explained in Stride. It followed that even if the Tribunal had erred in law, any such error was not material. In these circumstances, the following comment from the UT is obiter, but (it is respectfully submitted on behalf of the Council) is persuasive, and clearly right (para. 35, underlining):
“I am not wholly persuaded by the submissionthat the limits of FTT’s statutory jurisdiction necessarily preclude it (or indeed the ICO) entirely from considering, as a subsidiary matter, whether information is disclosable under the LGA. That is because if the LGA requires a public authority to disclose information, such a requirement is surely relevant to the public interest balancing exercise that must be carried out under the EIR”.
On the facts in Lourenco the Second Respondent asserts, the Commissioner, the FTT and the UT all upheld the local authority’s reliance on reg. 12(5)(e) in withholding early-stage planning information.
The Hearing:
Mr O’Sullivan took the witness stand and acknowledged and agreed he fully understood the importance of providing truthful evidence to the Tribunal and confirmed he had signed his witness statement and averred to the facts and matters set out therein.
The Tribunal are able to extract further material evidence from his oral evidence which is on the court record, and which undoubtedly has a significant bearing on our deliberations and in the interests of saving time and costs we will refer to the most salient points of influence upon us in our judgment herein.
Examination in chief: (Mr Lockley’s questions of Mr O’ Sullivan)
With reference to the Jopling decision and its influence, the witness explained that the Jopling decision did make the planning press when it was released in March and April of this year, it was circulated on a website and magazine called Planning Resource. So definitely, planning professionals within the council would be aware of the decision. In terms of other professionals interacting with the planning system and submitting planning applications, i.e. architects, surveyors, he couldn’t say with certainty that they would be aware of the decision.
The witness was asked if anyone raised it with him and he explained that no one had. He would attend pre-application meetings on occasion and had got a management team who reported to him, (probably in attendance at these meetings more than he was) but they have not raised any issue or discussions with planning consultants or pre-applicants attending these meetings.
The witness was asked if he was aware of any decrease in the number of pre-application advice requests and he explained - not in Lambeth where they have not seen much by way of increase or decrease. They have remained quite steady in the past 3 years. That’s not to say it would directly be related to the Jopling decision. There would be a variety of reasons why pre-applications might change in terms of submission numbers. There could be planning reasons, there could be a change in planning policy which could be at national level. The national planning policy framework which is the overarching national guidance on planning policy is due to be updated before Christmas and it is thought that the new government could release it early. There are discussions within that, - these may have been seen in the planning press which has been quite widely discussed. There are going to be policies around green belts, around grey belts, around development of ground field land and the government has a commitment, as has been public knowledge, to deliver 1.5m new homes. The Council very much want to kickstart economic growth within the country. Depending on what is in that document and the council could see an uplift in pre apps, because the development community would want to see how Lambeth as a planning authority interprets that the National Policy Planning Framework (“NPPF”) and what the council view is on developments coming forward in the future. Planning policy operates both at a regional level, London, the GLA and the Mayor’s London Plan and at a local level it would be Lambeth’s local plan. The benefit of pre-app is for pre-applicants to get the councils’ viewpoint on how a planning authority interpret and apply planning policy. So that is one element of why the council tend to see an uplift in pre-applications in and around the time when planning policy or guidance are updated and clearly, wider economic factors such as confidence in the development industry will have an effect on pre-apps. The council could not say one could read anything into the Jopling decision and in particular on it having an impact on pre-application submissions.
The witness was referred to para 27 of the submission where the Appellant is criticising the Councils’ position where the paragraph says: “the Council implies that a pre-application response would directly influence the final decision of a formal planning application.” and the witness was asked to comment. He explained (from his witness statement) and he did make a comment that a pre-application could be material to a planning application and what he meant by that is that a material consideration is anything that could be considered and a local planning authority should have regard to when making a decision and a determination on a planning application so that could be planning policies, it could be a range of planning issues such as transport, design, quality of accommodation if it was a residential planning application and pre-application. The Council would take the view that pre-apps could be, or can be a material consideration. That is something that government has set out in national planning practice guidance, which is on the internet and that is guidance for developers and planning authorities, in the government’s NPPF, where it is clearly set out that pre-applications could be material when it comes to determining planning applications. In his witness statement he has taken that wording directly from national planning policy governance.
The witness was referred to the open bundle, at page 112 where there are two paragraphs that start in the middle of the page and was asked if those paragraphs accurately state the position about the influence that the pre-app bias may or may not have on the final planning decision and answered that he agreed and pointed out that these two paragraphs are standard paragraphs that the planning authority would include in all pre-app responses. They are caveating that it is a without prejudice reply to a pre-applicant.
The witness was referred to the Appellant’s statement at para 31 where he says “…being in the conservation area the formal application will be heavily reliant on the conservation officer’s view, who is not usually a consultee at pre-application stage.” and the witness was asked if it is correct that the conservation officer is not usually a consultee at pre-application stage. He explained that thatis incorrect. For applications which could impact on a heritage asset, (meaning by a heritage asset it is a conservation area or a listed building), the council would consult the conservation officer on all pre-apps and planning applications relating to heritage assets. In this instance, the conservation officer was consulted on the pre-app submission and did provide comments.
The witness was asked if he would do that as a matter of course in any conservation area and he confirmed that that was correct.
Counsel then referred to the next paragraph 32 -wherein the Appellant had asserted it can also be the case that planning guidance change between pre-app and formal application, making the advice redundant and the witness was asked if that is a frequent occurrence, and he explained why that statement is incorrect for a number of reasons. What the panel members and the Appellant would have seen in the open bundle is a redacted copy of the pre-app. The reason for that is the pre-app advice covers a wide range of planning issues or considerations, so that would be everything from land use, to design, heritage if it is a conservation area or a listed building and the proposal could impact on those, transport, sustainability, biodiversity, fire safety etc. So, if guidance does change it is thematic or narrowed down to a specific part of the pre-app that wouldn’t cover the whole of the pre-application. Even if that was the case and the council were to adopt a new local plan, local plans are a long time in the making. A local plan will take upwards of 3 years to be adopted from when the planning authorities first start working on it until when it is adopted so there is a long lead in time, and any pre-app discussions would draw to the pre-applicant’s attention to the fact that there is a draft document currently being developed. In tandem, drawing their attention to adopted policies, the council would draw their attention to draft policies as well. In this manner he explained it is the case that the pre-applicant will be aware of draft guidance.
Counsel referred the witness to Para 37 where the Appellant states that “A Statement of Community Involvement is often a condition to validate a planning application…” and asked the witness if the term was used correctly there. The witness explained it is not used correctly in the sentence because a statement of community involvement is about engagement, this is a mandatory requirement, it is set out in legislation, and it is set out in the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004 and what this requires, is what each local authority does to produce a statement of community involvement that details how the council will consult and who we will consult. In terms of how the council consult, or what the mechanisms of consultation are he explained that will be letters to interested parties or stakeholders, site notices in terms of planning applications and it will be newspaper adverts. Those are the three most common types of publication consultation. Increasingly with social media and the council having various social media accounts which they will use as a method of consultation. The most recent statement of community involvement dates from 2020, so the council will be looking at updating that in due course and maybe taking account of new social media platforms.
Counsel asked the witness if a Statement of Community Involvement (“SOCI”) is something that accompanies an individual planning application and the witness indicated that it is not, because as it says, it is often a condition to validate a planning application. The council also have a national planning policy framework. That is a comprehensive list of documents that must be submitted in order to ensure that an application can be validated. There is a national list, and it contains things like planning application form, fee, location form and so forth. The council then has its own list which are add-ons to the national list. The council list in Lambeth was last updated in July 2016 and that would be the method by which the council would look to see if an application submission should be validated or invalidated. So, the statement in para 37 by the Appellant that it is the SOCI that is used to validate the planning application is incorrect.
Counsel then took the witness to Para 39 – where the Appellant is referring to the list of documents required for a full application, (that’s the Lambeth local list that Mr O’Sullivan had mentioned) and the witness clearly explained that a statement of public consultation is required as a condition for acceptance of the planning application for all major development applications and other development in sensitive area such as conservation areas or areas of historic importance that are likely to generate significant public interest.
Counsel asserted the point that the Appellant is making here is one that he makes elsewhere in his appeal, which is that for any application within a conservation area including the proposal that we’re dealing with in this case, which was in a conservation area, it is mandatory to have a statement of public consultation when you come to make your planning application. Counsel asked the witness to comment, and Mr O’Sullivan explained it is not, and the reason is, if one looks to the second paragraph, the italicised text which begins ‘all major development applications’, there is a subtlety to this statement in that it says, ‘conservation areas of areas of historical importance that are likely to generate significant public interest.’ The witness explained,  the council would only require a statement of public consultation if it’s in a conservation area and it’s likely to generate significant public interest and this document isn’t required for all developments in conservation areas, it’s only if there would be significant public interest in the conservation area.
Counsel then asked the witness how that is judged and whether something is of significant public interest. The witness explained that there could be a range of factors. One is clearly the scale of developments, so if something is for a couple of hundred new homes, it’s a very substantial scale of development in terms of building heights, so it might be tall buildings. It might be a development which contains land uses which could be seen as a bad neighbour, so maybe it is general industrial type uses, something like a manufacturing plant. It could be something where it’s an application to build on greenbelt, which clearly would be contrary to policy and that would be known as a departure from planning policy. So those kinds of elements or something that might be referrable to the Mayor within London. All of those would be of significant public interest because they’re likely to garner quite a lot of commentary from stakeholders and from local residents at the time of application submission. In that instance the council would classify that as significant public interest.
Counsel then asked the witness, if when thinking about the specific proposal we’re concerned with in this case, would that be a matter that was likely to generate significant public interest, and Mr O’Sullivan explained: “Absolutely not. Size of the applications might, but this is a very small application site, the quantum of development that could be achieved would be quite small. The potential for impact on stakeholders would be negligible and the council’s view is it would be confined to immediate properties and for that reason we would regard it as not of significant public interest. “
Counsel then referred to Para 43 from the Appellant where the more general point is made about internal stakeholders by the Appellant. Counsel asked the witness if it is correct that informal stakeholders are not usually consulted, and the witness explainedit depends on the type of pre-app. It depends on the stakeholder. If it’s an application that’s raising potential heritage sensitivities, then the council would consult the conservation and heritage team. If it’s something that’s likely to raise land use considerations, the council would consult the policy team who would advise on land use matters. If it relates to transport matters, the council will consult the transport colleagues. In this particular instance, the council did consult three internal consultees: a conservation officer, the transport team and the waste services team.
Counsel then referred to Para 54 where the Appellant is making the point at Para 53 where he says: ‘the Council has previously confirmed that it will not be developing the Garden itself and that it is being allocated for disposal” and refers to an email. The Appellant goes on to cite Section 9 of the Town and Country Planning General Regulations 1992 and as they’re set out, they state that the benefit of planning permission doesn’t run with the land effectively. Counsel asked the witness what his understanding of the position is, and Mr O’Sullivan explained that generally, if the local planning authority was to grant planning permission it would run with the land. Planning permission does not run with the person or with the Applicant. In the Town and Country Planning General Regulations 1992, there was that provision which is Regulation 9 which did state that any planning permission granted to a local authority would be personalised. It would, be for the benefit of the council or the local authority but it wouldn’t run with the land. That regulation was deleted in 2018 and what that means now is if planning permission is granted to a local authority in England, it now runs with the land and it isn’t personalised or specific for the authority. So, he explained section 9 of the Regulations has been struck out and no longer applies.
Counsel then referred to Para 46 – where the Appellant is referring to para 16 of Mr O’Sullivan’s witness statement and says, paragraph 16 suggests then that the Council policy is to check with the applicant anyway when a FOI request is made, but the Appellant asserts the Council has not provided evidence of this being a written policy, and the Appellant could not find this in the Council’s documents. Counsel then put to the witness that the Appellant is challenging Mr. O’Sullivan’s witness statement that he will check with an Applicant whether they are content for information to be released when an EIR or FOIA is made. The Appellant says there is no written policy on that, and Counsel asked Mr. O’Sullivan if that is that correct. The witness explained that the Appellant is correct as there isn’t a written policy, as it simply wouldn’t be possible to document and have a written procedure or policy for every aspect of what the council do as a local planning authority, however there is an unwritten procedure in place. In the role as Head of Service the witness confirmed he is responsible for all planning decisions made by the Council planning department. He will also vet EIR and FOIA requests before they are responded to. Responsibility lies with him within the council. He has put a procedure in place with his manager and team which requires that he signs off on these and further if looking to release an EIR or FOI response, he will definitely require that the council contact the pre-applicant or the applicant if it’s made on a live application, and give them a courtesy email or call that a request has been made for information and their thoughts on that. He confirmed that it isn’t documented.
Counsel then referred to Para 60 – where the Appellant is talking about the extent to which the pre-app advice gives readers additional information about the quantum of development that’s likely to be achieved on the land and he explained, the quantum can be extrapolated from the Local Development Plan which sets out the parameters for applications and is a document in the public domain. The pre-app advice will merely refer to what is indicated in the local development plan.
Counsel then asked the witness if it is the case that the quantum of possible development can be extrapolated mathematically form the local development plan in the way that the Appellant has indicated there, and the witness explained that planning is a design led approach and that comes from the Mayor and his London plan and then carries down to Lambeth’s local plan and very much any development on a site would be informed and led by design. The council would be looking at the scale mass and so forth. It would be right to set the general parameters of what might be achieved in terms of quantum by design but that is just one aspect of a planning application in the considerations of a planning application. The witness explained there are many other policies that need to be considered, so it is a wider planning judgement than just looking at design. It isn’t correct to say that one could look at the local plan and the policies and that will prescribe the quantum that you’re going to get. The witness did not accept that the Appellant is correct in his statement.
Counsel then asked the witness if he recalled what the fee would have been charged for the pre-app advice in this case, and he confirmed the fee at the point of submission was £2,333. The council pre application fees change on a yearly basis was £2,333 and the same application now would be £3,504.
Counsel asked if such quite significant sums of money are involved what is the value added from the pre-app advice as on reading the Appellant’s submission it looks like all it is, is reciting policies back to developer. If the developer is paying those significant fees, what value are they getting from that pre-app advice? The witness explained that the pre-app advice, within Lambeth is structured as it is because the council want to give a very clear steer on whether something is likely to progress toward getting approval or is something that has no legs, it should not progress. In essence it’s a gateway to say yes, thumbs up, there is merit in a proposal but it needs some refinement, and the council would invite one come back in for a follow up or for a pre-app; or alternatively indicate the proposal simply conflicts with policies and there’s no merit in the pre-app and it needs to be reconsidered on what is being  sought to develop on the site. First and foremost, it is a gateway. It can help with the interpretation of policies. So even though policies can be black and white, some policies within a local plan are open to interpretation. Two different planners will have different ways of interpreting the policy. The council are there to give a very clear interpretation on the wording of the policy and what Lambeth’s intention was when the council drafted that policy. The witness continued, if it does clear the gateway and the pre-application invites an application in due course, the council will want to try and streamline and get the application through in as timely a manner as possible. The council are very aware that developers, in wanting to bring forward developments on site, there clearly is a financial implication for them, so the council will do anything to hasten the process of potentially securing consent. The pre-app route assists with that.
Counsel then referred the witness to Para 63 where the Appellant is dealing specifically with whether it is possible for pre-app advice to add value to the land where the Appellant says, in stark terms, “ - no value is added to land by receiving pre-application advice, and only a formal Planning Consent could add value to a property”. Counsel asked the witness, is it correct that pre-app advice adds no value to the land to which the witness disagreed and explained that the pre-app advice can add value. In particular, the market value which is the metric that the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors would tend to use for property valuation purposes. Something for example with agricultural land which would have quite a low market value, if a pre-app was submitted to a planning authority saying is it possible for us to develop this agricultural site for residential… which would have a much higher market value per square meter and the local planning authority is aware of particular circumstances because residential would be supported on the agricultural land and can give a positive pre app response, the pre app or pre-applicant in that instance would look and attribute a higher value to the land. The witness explained the statement is correct in the sense that it will be a consideration in the land valuation but having a formal decision re-enforces and bolsters it. There is some weight in pre-app in terms of value to land, that would be the professional view on it.
Counsel then referred the witness to Para 114 – where the Appellant is talking now about the situation where someone is in negotiation for the purchase of land the Appellant effectively asserts a purchaser of land would also ask for any pre-app to be disclosed. Counsel asked the witness if it is the case in his experience that purchasers ask for pre-application to be disclosed to which the witness explained it was not in my experience. He would have thought if pre-app has been provided to a vendor – so in this particular instance, as we have seen it is the council, Lambeth has sought pre-app advice for its own land. If the council then sells the land to a purchaser, they are in possession of the pre-app advice, they could release it, it is within their gift to release it. The witness explained if it is an intended purchaser and they’re in discussions to buy the land and they make a request, the council wouldn’t release it. The councils’ approach is until a planning application is submitted, as a planning authority the council do not release a pre-app.
Counsel then referred to Para 155 where the Appellant is talking about the value of pre-app consultation versus post application consultation and the Appellant argues that if the local community are not able to shape the application before it is formally submitted, then the consultation after submission is sterile as it would not have considered any views from the local community.Counsel asked the witness if the Tribunal as a result of this hearing ordered the pre-app advice to be disclosed and it became public, would that give rise to any platform for the local community to comment on the proposal and is there any forum for consultation as a result: Mr O’Sullivan explained – he disagreed because the forum would be at the point a formal planning application is submitted. If pre-app advice was to be released and it circulated on a website i.e. or a WhatsApp chat and local residents were to write to the planning authority, there’s nothing for the council to consider, there is no planning application. The point at which the local planning authority would accept and consider representations is during a statutory consultation which is at the point of receipt of a planning application.
By way of clarification Counsel asked Mr O’Sullivan if when the Appellant says that the consultation at that point would be sterile, do you agree with that, the witness explained he did not because looking at what government is saying, first and foremost that it encourages pre-app dialogue, that’s set out in the National Planning Policy Framework. It isn’t mandatory but it is very much encouraged. So, there is an expectation that there will be pre-app dialogue and discourse in advance of planning application submission. After that there is a legislative requirement for a 21-day statutory consultation for interested parties. If government felt that it was a fait a compli and pre app has taken place and that negates the reason for a 21-day statutory consultation, that would be enshrined in legislation and there would be a catch all if pre app has taken place there’s no need for consultation because it’s a fait a compli. The witness confirmed that isn’t the case and explained even if there has been pre-app, the local community and interested stakeholders have a very valuable role to play. They are stakeholders who will know their local community at a granular level. So, if an application is received for a plot of land and there are neighbouring properties, the neighbours know the local site much better than the planners will because we don’t live next to that site. The purpose of the statutory consultation is to invite in those local voices and to make sure the council is aware of local facts at that granular level. The witness explained it’s not a case that if there has been pre app advice, there is no merit in consulting as it is a very valuable exercise. He explained that in his career on many occasions, where the council have given favourable pre-app advice, and matters have come to light at the statutory consultation stage, issues being raised that the council weren’t aware of, and they had to go back and seek further clarification. On occasions, the council might have even come to a decision that it couldn’t support the recommendation to approve and would have actually refused the planning application.
Counsel then by way of further clarification asked the witness if the Appellant is talking here about the case where there has been no pre-app consultation and something specifically proceeds to a formal statutory consultationwhat if there were only that formal statutory consultation, would that be a sterile exercise if the opportunity for the local community to influence the development would have been lost to lack of pre-app consultation. Mr O’Sullivan explained that it is very often the case that planning applications when submitted will evolve over the course of consideration. The council will look to secure amendments to design, layout, various other aspects. So, it is not just the council internal consultees that will provide comments which requires the scheme to be amended. It will be local interested parties such as neighbours, stakeholders and might be national bodies such as Historic England, National England, the GLA etc. So, all these parties will provide input which might require the planning application to be amended. So even in the absence of pre-app, the local community will have a role to play, and the scheme can evolve during its consideration of representations received.
As a result of queries raised by the Tribunal, Counsel asked the witness about the need for confidentiality when the Applicant is not an external third party but a unit of the council that would be bringing forward the development. Mr O’Sullivan explained that having talked about regulation 9 being deleted and that the council can bring forward development on its own, this is something the council deal with quite regularly in Lambeth as would a lot of other authorities across England. Lambeth would treat any application or request for pre-app, in that the council would be treated as a third party for that purpose. There isn’t any special internal procedure for a council application. Where there would be a difference, for example if there was correspondence between a Lambeth officer acting as the Applicant and the case officer in this case there probably is that ability to correspond by email because one will know someone’s name but in terms of how the pre-app is treated, it’s no different. This is done because from a legislative point of view, it’s clearly set out in the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004, section 38(6) of that legislation says all planning applications must be determined in accordance with the development plan unless the material considerations indicate otherwise. So, the councils’ starting point as a planning authority is to look at the planning policies and irrespective of whether the pre-app is made by an external third party or the council, both of those parties do need to ensure that they comply with planning policy and development planning policy. That would be the starting point.
Counsel then asked the witness if it is the case that the council will itself have information that is sensitive and confidential in the way that an external, third party might have that information and Mr O’Sullivan explained that for an external third party it will likely be a commercial business as they are looking at making profit. Or the council might on occasion have charities or other third sector bodies who make applications and while they may not necessarily be profit generating, any income they generate will go back into their operations. In terms of the council and as an internal body, in his witness statement he did refer to the requirement for the council to secure best value. The witness explained that this is a legislative requirement; it is under the Local Government Act. Colleagues within the council in making a pre-app, must observe there is a requirement for them to secure best value for the site. The council would in much the same way treat an external party as the information being confidential because there is a commercial interest, therefore the council would see that an internal body, in order to ensure best value, that there is a commercial sensitivity in much the same way. We would equate external parties’ commercial sensitivity with an internal best value sensitivity.
The Tribunal asked the witness if the release of that information to the world would prejudice the council’s obtaining of best value to which the witness explained that the disclosure (as talked about it in his witness statement)- that in disclosing it, it would disclose not just the type of development that is sought on a particular site but also the quantum. The council might be looking at developing a site for residential and looking at a tall building on the site or looking at something that’s five stories with five flats versus a two-story development… and clearly there is going to be different land value attributed to a five-story building versus a two-story building. Those discussions and what the local planning authority would be saying in terms of the quantum and what might be achieved on the site, there is a commercial sensitivity to that and that’s why the council wouldn’t want to release it at this moment in time. Identifying the quantum of a development from a reading of the local development plan would not necessarily be the case. Mr O’Sullivan explained Pre-app is often an interactive process and the council might have a pre-applicant come in with something that’s an opening gambit and they know that it’s not going to be achievable and it’s going to be back and forth discussion. That should be done in privacy between the authority and the pre-applicant because there is that commercial sensitivity to it.
Cross Examination – The Appellant’s questions of Mr. O’Sullivan:
The Appellant commenced his cross-examinationand asked when one does a pre app, it’s an incomplete building that doesn’t include all the reports because all the reports that one submits for planning are produced once the mass thing is complete and often a pre-app is a very limited set of information that doesn’t give the full picture of what it’s going to be. The consultation in turn is limited, and not to the extent one would have at a full planning application where at that point you launch it to the world to invite comments. The reality is at that point, once one wants to commit to formal planning, it’s because one knows it’s not going to have to change the scheme because it is very costly to go back once one submits and change drawings which then will affect all the reports which then potentially make the whole thing… having to pull an application and redo it is quite costly for developers.
The Appellant then referred to and added an extract which is Appendix 2 of his response- “pre application advice does not provide a formal decision or report but provides an advice note (which may be in the form of an email or an informal letter).” The Appellant asked if that the definition, is correct. Mr O’Sullivan agreed and explained there are instances where the council have given pre-app advice, and it doesn’t end up being a planning application.
The Appellant asked the witness if the council sells the land to someone else, will another party be bound to the pre app advice?” Mr O’Sullivan answered thatthey wouldn’t.
The Appellant then asked if it is not really something that goes with land, it is just a one-off advice to which Mr O’Sullivan confirmed the pre-app is confidential as well, it doesn’t run with the land.
The Appellant sought clarification on Para32 of Mr O’Sullivan’s witness statement, where he had indicated it can also be the case that planning guidance changes between pre-application and formal application. The witness explained it is unlikely; it takes a while, it takes a couple of years now. This pre-app advice has been out since February of last year.
The Appellant asked if this revised national framework has been… or the pre-application, assessed in line with the new policy framework to which Mr O’Sullivan responded no, it would have been assessed in line with the national policy framework in place at the time.
The Appellant sought further clarification about the changes that are coming into place that will affect that planning pre-app to which Mr O’Sullivan confirmed it would affect any future planning application, but the pre-app is a fixed point in time.
The Appellant explained his argument is that the pre-app then leading and being considered for the planning application when the policy would have changed in between one and the other so at that point the pre-app would have made little sense. There is also he commented the case that building regulations can change and affect the schemes… thinking that recently there has been a change in fire policies and some budlings have had to change… even planning consents had to be reviewed, so it is the case that in many instances that changes to the policies whether they are planning or buildings regulations will make the planning advice redundant really. Mr O’Sullivan responded that this was if the proposal was classified as a high-risk building.
The Appellant referred the witness to Para 37 of his statement. He put it to the witness he had mentioned that there’s no interest in the site, but can he be sure when there has been no consultation with anyone, and no one is aware of the pre-app that has taken place. The Appellant indicated that he’d been approached because of this piece of land, so how can the witness be sure that there is no public interest that warrants community involvement and the Appellant read from the statement of community involvement, October 2020, some extracts… item 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5 specifically; “Early community involvement should help shape and inform what is appropriate for a site and should therefore be undertaken before proposals are drawn up. 4.3.” – “Where developers have engaged with the community prior to submitting an application, the council will expect a consultation report to be submitted as part of the planning application. 4.4.
The Appellant put it to the witness that all planning applications of any scale will benefit (if only through improved processing of the application) from early engagement and discussion with neighbours and/or others likely to be affected by the proposed development. Mr O’Sullivan explained there is most likely to be public interest and clearly as an adjoining landowner with an interest in the pre-app, but the test is whether the council would require a statement of public engagement and would there be significant public interest. The council acknowledge that there would be public interest, but in order to meet that threshold to require that a statement is produced and furnished with any subsequent planning application, it would need to be significant. The witness explained Development of a site of this scale and size, in his professional view is it wouldn’t be significant public interest. As he had explained earlier on, the council would be looking at something that would be referrable, something of a very substantial size, EIA, so environmental impact assessment or something that might have garnered attention in the media or political involvement. For the redevelopment of this corner site or end of terrace site, it would garner significant public interest.
The Appellant expressed disagreement explaining there is about 50, 60 flats that face directly to that site… and having spoken with a couple of them who are interested in knowing what they’ll have from their terraces…”. Mr O’Sullivan explained what the aim of that particular document to be submitted was for major applications or if a site were within a conservation area, there would have to be significant public interest. There would need to be significant interest in heritage impacts on the conservation area. Looking at the facts of this particular case, he explained, some of this might be something to discuss in closed session because it would have to divulge the nature of what was said in the pre-app, but the statement of community involvement, the council website, and government do want local communities engaged in a planning process. It is a fundamental tenet of the planning system that there should be transparency. There should be engagement. That’s not to say this wouldn’t have happened. This was an initial pre-app.
The Appellant bluntly asked this because he had been in a position where there have been some small schemes when he had been encouraged by councils to consult with the residents in smaller schemes, because people are going to be affected by this, if the council are not doing this, why should a developer be consulting with the neighbours when the council are not doing it on their own application before having drawn up plans. Is that not against public interest. He asked the witness isn’t the public interest for this to be an open, transparent process. Mr O’Sullivan explained that the council very much encourage inquiry before planning applications are submitted and he explained, but very often it is an intricate process. A design journey very often isn’t let’s get something out, put it into the planning department and straight away the application will come in. Mr O’Sullivan explained there is a journey to go on, schemes will evolve so there is nothing tosay that…there’s no planning application, a planning application has not been submitted. There’s nothing to say that the council would not have engaged with the local community if it had progressed towards a planning application. There is a likelihood that they would have adhered to these requirements. This is pre-app number one, so if this pre-app had been responded to and an application was then submitted, the council probably would be reflecting and saying there was no engagement, but one pre-empt that Lambeth as an applicant or pre-applicant wouldn’t have gone through that process.
The Appellant explained he had been doing public consultations for years and people often just want to know what’s happening… and that’s the public interest, knowing what is being done. In para 46, which is in the sequence to do with the disclaimers on the pre-app form, the pre-app form includes a significant number of disclaimers to do with disclosures if an FOIA or EIR request is made and invites applicants to list any materials that are confidential. The Appellant asked the witness if the application included the checklist and any materials that are meant to be confidential. Mr O’Sullivan confirmed that it didn’t.
The Appellant asked the witness if he was involved in land acquisitions for the councilto which Mr O’Sullivan confirmed that he was not.
The Appellant inquired if, say he was acquiring land and needed to go for funding and the bank doesn’t even listen if there’s a pre-app, they don’t want to know. It’s a pre-app… it doesn’t add any value to the land unless there is a full application. It’s about someone purchasing land. The fact that there is a pre-app doesn’t automatically add any value. Disclosure or not of the pre-app doesn’t affect value of the land per se. Mr O’Sullivandisagreed, explaining that pre-app can add value to a part of land. The witness explained that with a pre app in Lambeth it is not just the opinion of a single officer, we don’t have a system where a pre-app comes in, an officer reviews and sends a letter out. It has to be cleared by management. So, it is the views of not just the allocated case officer but a senior member of staff as well. In any pre-app, the more the council are given at Pre-app submission stage, the more detailed the response can be. For example, that discussion around the agricultural land and someone makes a pre-app submission saying where they had acquired this piece of farmland and want to develop it for residential, submitting evidence to show that they can do this, there’s established case law, there are appeals. Lambeth has granted something similar on ten occasions previously, therefore with this bundle of evidence what is the potential for putting housing on this site. If the council were given that evidence and we’ve considered that we give a favourable support for redevelopment, there’s some merit and some weight to be afforded to that pre-app when it comes to deciding whether to acquire a site and develop it. Mr O’Sullivan explained he is not a commercial valuer, it’s not his area of expertise, but he does not think all sites will need a loan from the bank, there will be some developments that will move forward and be funded by the applicant, they might have their own reserves and are willing to take that risk.
The Appellant explained that he does not do pre-apps for buying land because otherwise someone else will come potentially while he is waiting for a response and he will make an assessment the pre-app is… again, he refers to all the caveats that are in pre-app responses that quite clearly note it is an opinion. The council will look at things that have been approved elsewhere. There’s case law that says each application is assessed on its own merit and that’s something that goes across the planning. Even applications that have been granted consent will sometimes lapse and when you try to re-apply for the same consent, you don’t get it. The other bit was based on pretty much the same about land value and… the final point I want to make; it is p.155… public consultation being done before planning approval. The Appellant stated he didn’t have any more questions but that he has agreed to disagree on some of the witness’s opinions.
Re-examination by Counsel Mr Lockley:
Counsel refers to the Appellant’s skeleton argument, and the very last page of the document which has an aerial photo of the relevant site.  Taking the witness to this for the Tribunal’s benefit because counsel reminds the witness that we have discussed the site with the benefit of that picture. Indicating the flats that the Appellant was referring to and asked about the impact on the amenity of the people in the flats of potential development on that site. Counsel asked if he has any comment by reference to the photo where we can see the actual layout of the broader site, about the impact of development on that site. Mr O’Sullivan explained one can see the application site is in the top left-hand quadrant. Interested parties and local residents, concern will usually be around amenity so that will be the impact on their living conditions and  there tends to be sunlight daylight impact - are they going to receive less sunlight to their balconies, windows, bedrooms, living rooms; are they going to be overlooked; loss of privacy; sense of enclosure so is something being built in very close proximity to their dwellings. What is seen here is the relationship of the application site to those apartment blocks to the right-hand side. There is quite a large separation distance. You see this large, landscaped grassed area in between the application site and the adjoining blocks, or the blocks are at a perpendicular and windows aren’t facing directly towards the application site.  Mr O’Sullivan explained in terms of the potential amenity impact on those properties the council wouldn’t think there would be significant public interest from an amenity perspective that would warrant the pre-applicant carrying out engagement and submitting that document with a planning application. The council have outlined that in advice to the pre-applicant and it wouldn’t be needed.
The Appellant interjected at this stage to inform the Tribunal that residents are also concerned about things like noise generated during the construction works and from equipment… how that affects them when most of these flats don’t have cooling so in summer the windows are open, how it affects the local amenities, there’s another couple of cars that are going to occupy the highway, the noise, the construction, the duration of construction and the impact that’s going to have on the residents, there’s a route to the school and that will pass right by the garden that’s where most of the students go past into school. It’s not just the amenity, the overlooking, there’s a bit more to building and how that affects people for a year or so it would take to build this thing and how then the permanent situation would affect them. There’s equipment etc. Mr O’Sullivan explained that the planning system is set up in such a way that when the council grant planning permission it is always conditional planning permission, and the Appellant will be aware of this. If there are matters that the council can secure through a planning condition and request further information at a later date, the council are required to do that. With construction impacts and potential noise, traffic disruption during construction period, there is what’s known as CEMP, construction environmental management plan. The purpose of that document is to manage environmental distance for the duration of the construction period. That is a regular document that the council would secure through planning permission. When an application is submitted, there is consultation for 21 days, there will be a draft version of that document. The applicant will be required to give an overview of how they intend to construct the development, what will the duration of the development be, what’s their proposed hours of construction and vehicle movements and so forth. That will be put out… interested people will have the opportunity to comment on that, those comments will be taken into consideration, if permission is granted, we will require through a planning condition a final version of that document which will tie down hours of construction and all the other potential impacts arising from construction methodology.
The Appellant commented that a lot of people won’t have the opportunity to speak and have their voice heard before it gets put to the planners. Mr O’Sullivan explained that with pre-app the council wouldn’t consult the public. The council internally consulted three parties as mentioned earlier, conservation, transport planning team, and waste services. The reason why the council engaged transport planning is they will provide professional advice on construction methodology, method of construction. They will look at expected vehicle movement, trip generation and so forth. They are a very experienced team, and they deal with these construction environmental management plans very routinely. The council would have taken their advice on board and fed that into the pre application response. The Appellant explained that as a member of the public he would have liked more information. hat he just wanted to add this point and that he was not currently engaged in one of these where the residents have asked him specifically to discuss this with them before it goes to the planners. He explained that a lot of people won’t have the opportunity to speak and have their voice heard before it gets put to the planners.
The tribunal raised a query of Mr O’Sullivan re the pre-app being confidential and running with the land. Mr O’Sullivan explained that it is not a formal decision of the council so what the council are required to do as a local planning authority, and this is a legislative requirement under the plannings acts, they are required to maintain a planning register. Every formal decision, every planning application that is determined, whether approved or refused, the council include that on the planning register., it is in the form of an electronic planning register if you were moving into Lambeth and looking to buy a house, you can go onto the register and see whether there has been any planning permissions granted on that road or has there been any planning decisions refused on that road. They would run with the land, if something is granted for a property you would be able to search that. He continued, pre-apps, because they are not a formal decision, they wouldn’t run with the land in the sense that they are not a planning decision, but yes, there is a record that pre-app advice has been given for the land, but it doesn’t sit on a register. The pre-apps are not on the register. That would be the case for all local authorities across the UK. We are required to keep a register of planning decisions, not pre-apps. There is no legislative requirement to do that. Of the witness’s knowledge of the 33 London boroughs, he confirmed he is not aware of any that would publish their pre- app responses. That’s not to say there isn’t, but from discussing with peer network and Heads of Service it’s not something that has ever come up in discussions i.e. that other London authorities would make their pre app responses publicly available.
The Tribunal raised a further query of the witness re: someone purchasing a site on which pre-app decision had been made and if they would have access to that. Mr O’Sullivan explained that the council wouldn’t have access; it wouldn’t be publicly available. If someone did purchase a site and were made aware that pre-app advice had been given and they wrote into the council and said they had been made aware that there was pre-app advice can they have it released…the council would be going through the same procedure that the Appellant has gone through, which is that he would say “I would like a copy of the pre-app” and the council would say until a planning application has been submitted it is confidential, the council don’t release it. We would decline the EIR request and apply the exemptions that have been applied in this instance. Only at the point that an application is submitted do we release a pre-app.
The Tribunal asked the witness if the pre-app process is an informal way to streamline for those who might want to embark on an application process. Mr O’Sullivan explained that it is. The government guidance on the MPPT website which was referred to earlier gives a number of bullet points which detail the value of pre-app and why government strongly encourages a pre-application before going through the costly exercise of preparing full planning submission and yes, part of that is cost expenditure. It was referred to it earlier, the planning application system in the 20 years where the witness has been engaged, it has become much more unwieldy. There’s a lot more requirements put on applicants than there was even 10 years ago. The Appellant touched on fire safety. Everyone will be aware that post Grenfell there are now conditions in buildings of 11 meters and above in height. The witness explained, yes, the cost of engaging an architect to actually draw up the scheme, but there’s a multitude of supporting documents and it will run into the 10s of 1000s. the development community see pre-app as a way of getting a very early-stage steer on it. A pre-app can be as minimal as someone writing a cover letter and saying see that plot of land there could I put residential on that plot of land, could I put a public house, a nightclub, an office, and if the council write back and say that in principle that land use is supported, then they may proceed to engage all these additional consultants and spend a lot of money. He explained it’s very helpful to establish basic principles before going to that expenditure.”
The Tribunal asked the witness re: the response to the pre-app being one for the individual making the submission rather than the world at large. Mr O’Sullivan explained: Yes, we always use the analogy that you don’t need to be the owner of the property to make a pre-app. Anyone living in and around Normandy Road i.e. could make a pre-app submission to the council and say see that plot of land, could it be developed it for the following. The response is furnished to that person, and it is their pre-app only. It doesn’t go on a register and sit there against that piece of land; it is just something for the person expressing an interest in maybe bringing forward a planning application. The planning system works in such a way that one could make a planning application tomorrow for the redevelopment of Buckingham Palace. The only thing one need to do is let the landowner know as part of the planning application that one is making a planning application. Westminster council would need to consider that and decide on the planning application. The planning system works in that respect - you don’t have to be the landowner to make a pre-app or make a planning application proper.  Some pre-apps are very light in touch, and it is just a case of establishing very basic principles. There mightn’t even be an architect commissioned; it is just wanting to establish is it a goer in principle. Others, we will see where that full development management team have been engaged. So, the developer feels, we know, we’ve looked at the policies, we’re quite confident that we can develop this site. In some cases, in the planning system, our local plans have what are called site allocations, so we internally have developed basic principles for the site. So, we’ve already published that we think the site is e.g. for educational use or residential use, or commercial… and the developer knows that and thinks ok, I’m going to run with this so I’m going to pay for an architect, a transport consultant, a sustainability consultant and all that comes to that pre-app, it just means that the more they give us, the more definitive a response we’re going to provide. You tend to see this with the bigger sites and the bigger developers, your volume house builders, your Barclays of this world. They will engage with pre-app with a lot of front-loaded material, but for a site like this which is quite small in scale you probably would find that pre-app… you wouldn’t get the full development team engaged at pre-app stage. There is no minimum requirements for a pre-app in terms of supporting information whereas as we touched on earlier, the local information requirements document, that is very specific, it is mandatory, we have to publish one of these and that does say if you are submitting an application for 10 or more homes you need to submit all of these documents and there’s a long list of documents that are mandatory. If one doesn’t provide this to the planning authority the council won’t validate planning application.
Appellant’s Closing Submissions:
The Appellant explained that as a layman it seems simpler to him than it has been. When he looks at it, he looks at basics of the EIR regulations and the definition which aims to increase transparency and accountability in the public sector. That is the starting position unless it can be demonstrated that there is an exemption or exception that will apply and of course the adverse effect. He believes that this is all being assessed on a case by case rather than… a bit like a planning application on the merit of each application. with land…and anything that’s done to it will affect us directly. So, it’s all about getting information and knowing what’s happening. What pushed him towards an appeal was the fact that the wording in the internal review was specifically saying that it would… that is disclosure would be likely to cause harm or distress to the third party. That was specifically worded in that way in the internal review. At that point the Commissioner was already involved, and he had this conversation with the Information Commissioner’s Office (“the ICO”) at the time who thought that this meant there was a third party. The Appellant provided evidence that there is no third party, as he saw a third party, as a separate party and that triggered this appeal. So firstly, the Appellant would like confirmation about this understanding… The Appellant argues that a third party is a separate party and this wording in the internal review is incorrect. The confidentiality of proceedings – (he refers to a recent decision in the Jopling decision in regard to this) surmising this procedure should broadly apply to the final decision-making stages. He specifically asked will someone buying the land be bound to it because if there is no cause and effect can we really say that this is connected with the final decision making. It was confirmed that regulations can change, and this can change again so it is not directly tied to the final decision making. It can just be a free-standing bit of information. There is no definition within Lambeth’s pre-app guidance which defines the pre-app response as taking the form of an email or being an informal letter and all of this is against the idea that this is a formal procedure, it’s an advice note, that can be free standing but it’s not formal. The Jopling case has upheld that idea, that it’s not adequate to refer to a pre application advice as a proceeding and that is the Appellant’s view too. There are other bits that are common to the other exemptions, the public interest and the adverse effect.
Regarding 12(5)(e) The Appellant agrees there is no argument about this being information that relates to commercial…it relates to bit of land that the council is trying to sell… and the argument is not if this is commercial information if it’s related to the adverse effect. The Appellant argues it is in the public interest.
Re 12(5)(f) The Appellant is troubled by the idea of a third party, which in his view is a separate entity, not a different sector within the same company. The whole exception and the guidance he can find on the Commissioner’s website all seem to be geared toward information that’s provided by third party into the council. Referring to the argument that was made before and still it’s subject to the test of the adverse effect and the public interest. The adverse effect he argues has two consequences that are suggested by the council and Mr Lockley submits firstly that the council by disclosure would somehow lose bargaining position or some form of bargaining high ground if someone else knows what the pre-app advice response has been. The Appellant argues that in his experience to date it has not been this, the pre-app advice, even if someone has it doesn’t really come into effect and disclosure of it wouldn’t really affect the council. They can sell to whoever they want and the person who is competing to acquire it from the council can take a risk and that would be independent from what the pre-app information is. From the Appellants perspective, it is only about knowing what the council intends to do next to his house.
Second on the adverse effect is how it would affect the planning pre application service as a whole and how this could deter future applicants from lodging pre applications. From the Appellants perspective (again referring to the Jopling decision) it has not affected it adversely at all, what we’ve been doing, we’ve still been submitting pre-app and planning performance agreements. That has not stopped us in any way he argues, not deterred us in any way. The same way if the decision would be to uphold the appeal, we don’t see how that could make any difference to the decision that’s already out there. We don’t think that it could affect in any way the planning system as a whole, the ability of the council of providing this service. The reality is that developers, such as the ones he has worked for in the past, don’t really use this system because of the confidentiality. Confidentiality is one aspect of it that doesn’t really come into play. The usefulness of the service is being able to start with a conversation while you are preparing the formal application and being able to accelerate that process and that is nothing that the Appellant contests. He has used the pre-app service before and would carry on using it even with the Jopling case, even if a decision would be here to uphold this appeal. The Appellant states he does not see there could be an adverse effect in that sense. He does not accept that the council would somehow loose bargaining potential or would give an unfair advantage to anyone else by providing the pre-app advice received. Anyone that’s in the business of acquiring land will make their own assumptions, take their own risks, and that’s independent of the pre-app information. So, he argues, it would not reduce the asking price that the council could expect, the sale price, because it’s not tied to the pre-app information… it’s tied to what developers, or what whoever wants to buy this land, can achieve with it, that’s something they discuss with their own teams. That’s something the Appellant indicates he can do on a daily basis. That is why he does not see there could be an adverse effect. The case law in London Borough of Sutton v The Information Commissioner EA/2017/0064 says disclosure is the condition, not that it could or should. It needs to be more likely than not that an adverse effect would occur, and the Appellant does not think that that likelihood exists. The Appellant maintains that developers will carry on using the pre-app advice when they see fit. They tend to use more planning agreements and often the pre-app gets thrown away because of other ideas of what we want to do with it. That, he argues shouldn’t affect the asking price. What affects the asking price is what we believe we can do with that piece of land and that’s independent of what the pre-app advice has been. If someone from next door acquires land, they don’t really have to carry on with the pre-app advice that’s been given. The Appellant argues that from reading through the feedback the public interest is where the balance is. It doesn’t seem that you can justify…again going back to how it would affect the planning system, it would deter people from using the system, it would not, he argues. The public interest in having a pre-app service that allows streamlining of the planning process wouldn’t affect it because the Jopling decision is out there and it hasn’t, that has been confirmed by Mr O’Sullivan earlier. Developers know now… because the Appellant says his company knows, but no one really knew or seems too bothered about this because we still use the system regardless. He maintains there was an argument that’s in line with the previous adverse effect which is the public interest of the council being able to get as much as they can for the land is again not down to the planning pre-app being released or not, it wouldn’t really affect the asking price, that’s down to who is going to be buying it, how risk averse they are and how far are they willing to go to acquire the land. That means that wouldn’t affect the asking price and that would maintain the public interest in making sure that the council is able to fund itself by selling assets. That’s not something that would be affected. There are, he maintains, arguments for the public interest. He also refers to Bristol City Council v The Information Commissioner and Portland and Brunswick Squares Association EA/2010/0012 where the Tribunal considered that the fact that the Council itself formed the site to be developed which gave rise to the need for particular scrupulousness and that’s where we’re coming from, we expect that our council would lead by example and that is in the public interest, that the council would take the lead and be open about their own dealings. The fact that they own the land, it’s the assumption here, that would be more open, and they would do what they are meant to, which is to promote openness and transparency in local and national government. The number of people affected by the proposal, even if it’s one, it’s still someone that’s affected by the proposal and he argues it serves the public interest to know that the council is sensitive to this. He mentioned before the effect of not releasing the information. Does it not give rise to an argument that maybe developers don’t need to focus that much on doing public consultation as much as we do and understand, He does quite a lot of it and needs on a day-to-day basis to be ready to pick up the phone and apologise to someone because we were too noisy five minutes before 8am. This, he maintains, is something that is relevant here. The public interest is having a transparent local authority that cares about their residents and particularly when they own the land, they are able to lead and to demonstrate to other developers that there is a sensible way of doing it by engaging with the residents rather than just completely ignore… again, when you can see that the adverse effect as has been demonstrated by the Jopling decision…again, we don’t really understand how the disclosure would affect the asking price. He does this for a living and it’s not something that he understands, or thinks is justified. There’s a comment on the gist he refers to which is that there has been an explanation of why disclosure of the advice would prejudice the council’s ability to meet its best value duty. He does not understand it and he does this on a day-to-day basis. If he thought there was an adverse effect, he wouldn’t be suggesting this but because he does not see the harm that can be done, particularly since if the council owns the land how is that going to affect it… it is not like someone is going to take the pre-app and do their own application. It is in his view isolated in that way. The remainder of the gist he argues seems to just suggest that the detail of the pre-app has been developed to a good standard, that doesn’t seem to the Appellant to materially affect his comments. This he submits is the core of his argument.
The Appellant understandably conceded he doesn’t really have the capacity to go through 366 pages of case law. What he wanted to know is what the council is doing next to his house. He agreed he has not argued that the information is not commercial in nature, what he has argued is it is so sensitive so commercially secret or unique, that it would be affected by disclosure and that is the principle point that he is making. It’s a pre-app and the land ownership just means that whoever’s got the land does whatever they want with the land.
The Second Respondents submissions:
The council say this case contains pre application advice relating to a proposal for development of a small plot of land in Lambeth’s area. The public interest in disclosing that, the council say, is very limited, because in the Appellant’s own words in the exchange he had with the council prior to making the request, his is the only household that would be directly affected by the council’s decision with regards to it. While there may be indirect effects on other properties, that is the Appellant’s own words. The council say the public interest in disclosure is a narrow one. Conversely, there are wider interests in play that favour maintaining the exception. That’s broadly speaking the confidentiality of the pre-application process itself and the commercial interests of the council.
A narrow public interest in disclosure as against the much wider public interest in maintaining the exceptions. The material exception in this appeal is, Reg. 12(5)(d). The Commissioner also agreed that the council is entitled to redact a small amount of personal data, but that is not contested by the Appellant, just some names, email addresses… that is recorded at paragraph 8 of the Commissioner’s response page 27 of the open bundle.
Reg.12(5)(d) first, the issue that arises is the meaning of the term proceedings. This was an issue identified by the Tribunal in its case management decisions on the basis of the Jopling case following the paper consideration. The starting point is of course a natural meaning of the word proceedings, and the council say that natural meaning is a very broad one. It could encompass the actions or activities of any body. One reads that term in the context of the statute and the case law and both of those underlines, in order to merit the protection of 12(5)(d) the proceeding has to be something sufficiently well defined, of a certain level of gravity or significance to warrant the confidentiality that the exception provides. Hence the reference in the case law to a certain formality. On the term formality. Whether something is formal or not is a sliding scale, there’s no binary test whether something is formal or not formal and it follows that there’s no gotcha point for the Appellant when he says that in the council’s document, he describes the advice as informal in some places. Plainly, a pre -application is less formal than the determination of a planning application. On the other hand, it could be more formal than a routine response the council would send to an email query from a resident. The fact is that it has a certain level of formality as it is a service for which developers pay thousands of pounds, they receive expert advice – in this case in a letter stretching over 11 pages – that applies planning policies, exercises, expert judgement, so it’s not merely an off the cuff response. It is somewhere in the middle: not as formal as a planning application but above a mere informal response. The second point… the whole notion of whether something is formal or not is, the council submits, a gloss – it’s not any part of the statutory definition, so it shouldn’t be elevated to a hard-edged issue of law. It is not a matter that is amenable to being a hard-edged or bright line test because it’s a sliding scale…as to whether something is formal or informal. We see how this plays out in the case law. The first case to look at the nature of what proceedings is, is the case of Chichester DC v IC and Friel [2012] UKUT 491 (AAC), which is at tab 6 of the Authorities Bundle starting at p.191. The simple point is what was considered in that case a proceeding, because the case concerned potential sale of a council owned site. Planning permission was granted. That valuation was considered as a matter of report by the management committee. That took about two years to determine but shortly after the planning application was made, a few days later, the Executive Board meeting decided to make a contribution to a local football club. That was the meeting in question. There was no final decision taken. The planning application had only just been submitted, and it was at that meeting where an item was taken in closed session that the Upper Tribunal accepted that that could amount to a proceeding. So, it was a local authority meeting but not one which any form of final determination was being taken. The Friel case does of course predate the Court of Justice decision in Flachglas Torgau v Germany (Case C-204/09) [2013] QB 212, that’s at tab 17. If we pick it up on p.344, you see the heading Question 2(a) and (b), those were the questions that were referred to the court. On reading those, the Tribunal will see that they are not about the scope of the term proceedings at all. It is about the way in which confidentiality has to be provided for in law. At para 63 over the page, and we see the court’s comment: “national law must clearly establish the scope of the concept of ‘proceedings’ of public authorities referred to in that provision, which refers to the final stages of the decision-making process of public authorities.” That’s something of an aside, it’s not germane to the question the court is answering. There is no reasoning to support it, it is just thrown out there by the Court of Justice, somewhat surprisingly since at 65 the court then goes on to straight away say that “the concept of proceedings… is for the national court to determine Nonetheless, that is considered in our domestic case law in the case of Department for the Economy (Northern Ireland) v IC and White (GIA/85/2021). which is at tab 11 of the bundle. If we pick that up at para 27 we will see a discussion of what assistance the Upper Tribunal had about the meaning of the term proceedings. The first point is not defined in the Directive or in the regulations, there’s some citation from the ICO’s guidance which gives a number of examples: "". So, the ICO’s guidance is not tying things necessarily to the taking of a decision. It appears the Upper Tribunal is deriving some assistance from the ICO’s guidance. At page at 247, one sees requests “may be refused where disclosure of that information would adversely affect the confidentiality of the proceedings of public authorities, where such confidentiality is provided for under national law, and not the entire administrative procedure at the end of which those authorities hold their proceedings.” So, what the Court of Justice seems to be saying there, is that it is tying its definition of proceedings to that which is protected by confidentiality. So, we can gain some assistance from the scope of confidentiality obligation as to what the scope of the proceeding is. That makes sense when one thinks about what it is that the exception is seeking to protect in the first place: proceedings that are confidential as provided for in law. Then we come onto Flachglas, and that passage is cited at para 31 in White at p.248 of the Authorities Bundle, the Upper Tribunal makes its own conclusions. It says: “The scope of ‘proceedings’ is not defined. However, I consider that the term must broadly apply to the final decision-making states of an authority, as indicated by the CJEU in Flachglas.” So, it is not treating the Flachglas condition about final stage of decision making as the single determinative test, broadly as indicated in Flachglas. We can see in the same para how broadly the Upper Tribunal did apply it in that case. It held that proceedings could extend to internal discussions about how a government department was going to conduct legal proceedings. So that’s not a matter of any external decision taking, they’re not exercising a statutory function when they held those discussions, although there was a statutory function in the background in that case. The conclusion rested simply on the fact that the department’s own conduct of the litigation required formal decision-making steps and consideration of evidence and legal advice. The council submit ‘formal’ must be used in a fairly flexible way in that sentence because an internal legal strategy meeting is not necessarily formal in the usual sense that a formal council meeting might be described as formal and further it is referring to the ongoing conduct of litigation, tactical matters, rather than any final decision that the department had to take. In the councils’ submission, it’s a flexible principle that we see from the case law. That is why the council argue the First Tier Tribunal went wrong in the Jopling decision. The council submit it must be that Jopling was wrongly decided, and this Tribunal should not follow it. As submitted in the councils’ skeleton argument para 48, it is a decision on the papers, the Tribunal had submissions only from the Appellant who was a litigant in person and the public authority which didn’t address the issues. The council submit the FTT went wrong by applying the Flachglas criterion in an overreaching way as if it were a determinative test for proceedings rather than one indication in the mix about whether something could properly be termed proceedings. Applying what this council argue is the correct analysis to the pre-application process, it is one with sufficient structure and formality that results in advice of considerable weight, even if it is non-binding as everyone accepts. It is sufficiently significant and considered, that the whole process of seeking and giving that advice can qualify as a proceeding within the proper meaning of that term. There’s a set form for applying for that advice, set fees which are very substantial, Lambeth has published deadlines for responding (the Appellant makes reference to those at para 166 in the open bundle), when Lambeth receives a request it engages its expert planners, they consult other expert statutory officers and they provide advice which is of a reasonable degree of formality, applying skill and judgment to a complex set of planning policies, and which can be a material consideration in the determination of planning permission. The council submit that falls naturally within the meaning of proceedings, as the Commissioner has found in a series of prior DN’s which are listed at para 18 of the DN. Certainly this is a view the Commissioner has taken consistently in the past, para 4 of the open bundle.
The other element of 12(5)(d) are made out, confidentiality provided by a law. That can be common law it doesn’t have to be a statutory test. The Applicant says that there can’t be confidentiality where the Applicant is the council itself. There are two answers to that submission. One is that there is no requirement in law, either in the EIR exceptions or how common law confidentiality works, that’s confirmed in authorities. The second answer to that point is in the circumstances of this case, one arm of the council is acting in a way that distinguishes it from a different arm / entity in the council department… one is seeking and one is giving advice, and that disaggregation between departments in the council becomes formalised in statute in any case that proceeds to a planning application, this is the  Town and Country Planning General Regulations 1992 which permit a local authority to decide its own planning application, but requires some separation as between the personnel who make the application and determine it in order to respect the rules of natural justice. The law on confidentiality. 12(5)(d) and (e) exceptions both rely on confidentiality provided by law. In our law, that’s the common law duty of confidence. That common law duty doesn’t require the information to have been obtained from someone who is in law a third party. The Council say that is clear first of all, by a comparison with the terms of section 41 FOIA. That is cited conveniently in the Friel case, tab 11 in the Authorities Bundle, starting at page 195. Para 20 – contrasts section 41(1) FOIA which provides authority from any other person (including another public authority).
On the facts in this appeal, it is not disputed that as soon as a suggestion of disclosure was raised by the Appellant, the council official made the expectation of confidentiality very clear. Open Bundle p.166 – where we have an email from the Appellant to that officer at the culmination of a quite lengthy exchange between them. The Appellant wrote: “Since the pre-app consultation is already taking place, I will lodge a FOI act request with the council to have sight of the proposals.” That triggered the email above at p.165, where the Council officer forwards the chain to a senior person in the planning service and two paragraphs up from the bottom writes: “He has now said he intends to lodge a FOI request (see email below) to ascertain details of our proposals. My understanding is that conversations are private as we have not really confirmed anything yet.”
It is clear that there is an understanding and an expectation on behalf of the Applicant that at this stage matters will remain confidential. The Council officer then sets out various exceptions, which she understands will apply. Turning over the page to p.166, it indicates the attachment of a case for information. It’s not clear whether what’s being attached and referred to there is an ICO or a FTT case, but either way the council submit it shows that Applicants do pay attention to legal and regulatory decisions about the confidentiality of pre-app discussions. That obviously matters to this Applicant and those decisions do condition expectations. It is, the council argue,  clear from the terms of the email that there is a strong expectation and preference for confidentiality from this Applicant although it is to be noted the comment: “Once we have progressed to full planning permission, I am happy for the information to be made public.”  So, the expectation of confidentiality relates very specifically to the early stage at which we find ourselves.
The last element of the statutory test 12(5)(d) is whether confidentiality protects the proceedings, which is the terms of the exception. The council  submit it does. Certainly, directly speaking, the duty of confidence applies to information rather than the meeting or the exchange or the proceeding itself, but those proceedings consist of the exchange of that information. The whole reason to protect the information is so an Applicant can seek and receive advice through a process which is itself confidential. That is reflected in the email we’ve just looked at. The Applicant’s understanding is that conversations are private, the exchange itself is private, and accordingly the council say the confidentiality is there to protect the proceedings and it follows naturally that disclosure would adversely affect that confidentiality because it would dissipate, the proceedings would no longer be confidential. For all of those reasons the council say the elements of 12(5)(d) are made out with developed pre-app advice and a relatively clear decision from the local authority about what is and what is not likely to be acceptable.  The Appellant himself said in his submissions, developers will go with what they’re likely to be able to achieve.
In effect the binding authorities have established 1) Re: the background, the common law duty of confidence does not exclude the case where the information has been internally generated, and 2) that the EIR do not include any separate requirement that that should be the case.
On the issue of in confidence and causation i.e. adverse effect caused the council dealt with the issues comprehensively in their written submissions and referred to above.
The last element of the statutory test 12(5)(d) is whether confidentiality protects the proceedings, which is the terms of the exception. In the councils’ submission it does. Directly speaking, the duty of confidence applies to information rather than the meeting or the exchange or the proceeding itself, but those proceedings consist of the exchange of that information. The whole reason to protect the information is so an Applicant can seek and receive advice through a process which is itself confidential.  The Applicant’s understanding is that conversations are private, the exchange itself is private. Accordingly, the council say the confidentiality is there to protect the proceedings and it follows naturally that disclosure would adversely affect that confidentiality because it would dissipate, the proceedings would no longer be confidential. For all of those reasons the council say the elements of 12(5)(d) are made out. Lambeth’s case is based on whether the information could affect the value of the land, as the Tribunal heard from Mr O Sullivan who has specific expertise on the side of the local authority and its own dealings. The nub of the dispute is whether there would be an adverse effect. The Appellant says pre application advice doesn’t affect the value of the land at all. So, he makes two related points 1) the pre-app advice doesn’t affect the final planning decision and presumably as a consequence, he says 2) it doesn’t affect the value of the land. The council argue that both of those are wrong. He puts both of those in much too stark terms. Mr O Sullivan, clearly, frankly and candidly admitted that a final planning consent will have more substantial affects, but the effect of the pre-app advice is not nothing and remains significant. Particularly in cases such as this one where we have a relatively well developed pre application advice and relatively clear decision from the local authority about what is and what is not likely to be acceptable.  The Appellant himself said in his own submissions and avers that developers will go with what they’re likely to be able to achieve. But the whole purpose of the pre application planning service is to give them guidance on what they’re likely to be able to achieve, that was the thrust of Mr. O’ Sullivan’s evidence and is reflected in the statutory guidance on the purpose and the value of the pre-app process. Why, the Council ask do the developers pay thousands of pounds for the pre-app advice if they’re not getting from that anything of value, any insight into what is likely to be acceptable to the local authority. In the council’s’ submission it clearly advances the case to a significant degree, as to what the developer can expect to achieve on any given site. That being the case that will have a material impact on the value of the land. Mr O’Sullivan provides by example, the quantum of development, the number of residential units you could get on a site, is going to affect its value, e.g. it’s more valuable if you can put three flats on it versus single two-bedroom house. The pre-app advice in general will narrow down those variables, the scope of what’s achievable. The council say in this particular case, that is what happened. It does move the conversation along.  What would be the point in it if it didn’t. That additional value is also of interest and of commercial sensitivity for the council and can prejudice and adversely affect its negotiating position in the way Mr O’Sullivan described and in the way the Tribunal saw in the closed session. For those reasons, I say 12(5)(e) is engaged. The council submit that the case law in the authorities’ bundle supplied to the Tribunal establish disclosure would adversely affect the interests of the person who provided the information for two reasons. One is the commercial interest point already discussed and the second is the chilling effect, the unwillingness to use the pre-application process in the future, therefore foregoing the benefits of that from the Applicants point of view. In considering here the interests of the person who provided the information, the Applicant.
The Tribunal are considering the effect of disclosure to the world at large and so effectively have to assume wide publication of this advice even if the Jopling decision has not had a wide effect. It could be due to countervailing factors such as the economic outlook or the example Mr O’Sullivan gave of more favourable planning policy coming in the pipeline. So, there are lots of other confounding factors that would make it very hard to prove the Jopling effect. Nonetheless on the basis of the reaction of the Applicant in this particular case from the emails from Rubina Nisar (on behalf of the council)  and the  reliance of the case law or the Commissioner’s DN’s to support their expectation of confidentiality the council invite the Tribunal to find on the balance of probabilities that disclosure in this case would have an adverse effect on the willingness of applicants either to use the service or to give the same degree of specificity and detail when they use the service.
The EIR exceptions don’t give me the luxury of saying ‘would be likely’, they’re all introduced by the words in 12(5), so there’s only one threshold for the EIR exception and it’s equivalent to the higher exception. There is no issue with the Appellants’ legal submission on that, that is clearly correct.
The second element of the test 12(5)(f) was the person under any legal obligation to supply the information. The council maintain the answer is no. All parties agree this is a voluntary process. Did the person supply the information in circumstances where the recipient public authority or any other public authority was entitled to disclose it and the council maintain the answer to that is no, because it was protected by confidentiality for the reasons already given as evidenced by the correspondence from the Council officer for  Lambeth  and would only be entitled to disclose it if there was a statutory basis for doing so. The Tribunal are assisted on this very specific issue by the decision of the High Court in the Stride case, which confirms that pre-application information wouldn’t be disclosable under the regime of access to information at local authority meetings, set out in the Local Government Act 1972. Tab 13 of the authorities’ bundle, if we start at para 22, there’s a summary in Stride of the law in relation to public access of local government meetings. The basic position is that those meetings are open unless the information is exempt. Para 23 notes that: “the descriptions of exempt information are those for the time being specified in schedule 12A, the relevant parts of which provide: at - 3. Information relating to the financial or business affairs of any particular person (including the authority holding that information) …is exempt. - 9. Information is not exempt information if it relates to proposed development for which the local planning authority may grant itself planning permission or permission in principle pursuant to regulation 3 of the Town and Country Planning General Regulations 1992.”
The regulation allowing the local authority to grant itself planning permission. Clearly, para 9 is saying certainly in the paradigm case where there has been an application, that that will not be exempt information. The question that arises in Stride is, what is the position at pre application stage, is that information falling within the general exemption in para 3 or is it carved out because it’s information to which para 9 relates. HHJ Jarman considered this and determined it effectively at paras 38-39 by his consideration of the overall purpose of the scheme. Turn to p. 278, - para 28. It identifies the competing interests on the one hand safeguarding the financial and business interests of the authority, and on the other the interests of transparency: post application, “It is clear that in the interests of transparency, once the authority is applying for planning permission for development on its own land, then such safeguards should no longer apply and the public should have access to relevant financial and business information.” At Para 39: “the authority accepts that once that stage is reached, there must be public access to, and hence scrutiny of, such information before planning permission is granted. Given that that will happen, the question is whether in balancing the competing interests of public access and private interest, the purposes will be served by disclosure of such information when the proposals are at an early stage. In my judgment, it is not difficult to see why proposals may be prejudiced by the early disclosure of such information. In this case, that applies in particular to the negotiations and contracting with other landowners.” Para 40: “Accordingly, I conclude on ground 1 that paragraph 9 on its proper interpretation did not apply so as to render the information withheld from the public in the private session of the meeting as not exempt.”  Information at pre-application stage is exempt from disclosure under the LGA. For the immediate purposes of whether there is any other entitlement to disclose the information, they confirm that there is no basis for disclosing it under the LGA regime. The final condition has the person supplying information consented to its disclosure. The council argue, absolutely not, in quite strong terms as we have seen in the emails. The council submit the relevant exemptions protect two separate but related interests: confidentiality in the pre-app process and the commercial interests of the council. Submissions briefly on that prejudice that the council say would arise and the weight and significance of it; and then balancing that against the public interest in disclosure. The council argue the prejudice would arise as disclosure would tend to damage the applicants’ belief that sensitive information could be protected prior to submitting a planning application, even if they have specifically requested this. The council argue two effects are likely over time: fewer advice requests and less detail in the requests that are received. Both of those effects would be significantly contrary to the public interest because the benefits of pre-app advice are recognised very clearly in national planning policy, that is encapsulated in the quotation at para 6 in Mr O Sullivan’s witness statement p 125 of the Open Bundle: “significant potential to improve both the efficiency and effectiveness of the planning application system.” Para 8 of his witness statement then lists a number of benefits, the council say those are considerable and significant, they improve design, flush out site specific issues, all of that results in better proposals, bringing forward more appropriate development which local authorities can in turn handle and determine more effectively and efficiently saving costs all round. Those are the councils’ submissions on clearly very weighty public interests and on the balance of probabilities that gives rise to very significant prejudice which is not outweighed by the interests of disclosure in this case. Nor is there any reason why that prejudice would not arise in the case where the Applicant is an entity within the council, the case that we are talking about here.
The council argue that the Commissioner didn’t do any worse than apply a misleading label, the council maintain the Commissioner misunderstood the fundamentals of the underlying proposition because she knew it was the council as Applicant.
Against that, the Appellant says that the pre-app process ought to be itself a public consultative process. He says i.e. in a conservation area, all applications should undergo pre-application consultation as opposed to pre-application advice. The council’s reply submission is 1) that’s wrong, it’s not the case in every case and it wasn’t the case in this case. As Mr. O Sullivan emphasised, the council’s policy is in a conservation area, there should be pre-app consultation if there is significant public interest in the proposal. He gave the Tribunal reasons why that was not the case; and 2) It is really a side issue because if a developer were carrying out public consultation, the developer would be in control of what information it put before the public as part of that consultation. It doesn’t have to include information if it considers it sensitive and it can still carry out meaningful consultation without doing so. On the other hand, what the Appellant is proposing to meet that public interest in early consultation is disclosure of a submission that has been drafted with the idea that it will remain confidential and may therefore contain sensitive information. It may also just contain information that’s not particularly relevant to the external factors such as information about the internal layout, the quality of the building materials. Those are matters that are not going to be of particular concern to the public who might properly thereafter be consulted on amenity issues. Attempting to meet the public interest in early consultation by disclosing a document that was drawn up for a different purpose and may contain confidential information because it was assumed to be confidential, the council submit is not an effective or appropriate way to go about meeting public intertest to the extent that it exists. The council’s policy is that it’s not required in every case and that this was a case giving rise to very little wider concern.
The second significant prejudice that would arise is the commercial sensitivity issue. The council argue that disclosure of this advice would have an impact on value of land and the council’s position in negotiations and would therefore prejudice its ability to use its statutory duty to achieve best value. The combined weight of those two prejudices is very significant indeed. The Tribunal are invited to weigh that and contrast that with the public interest in disclosure, which the council maintain is relatively modest.
Although this is a proposal which only directly affects a single property, as the Appellant does note in his submissions at p. 168 of the open bundle. The Appellant has tried to show that the site is visible to a large number of dwellings because there are flats opposite or to the side. As Mr O ‘Sullivan explained, there are very large blocks of flats, they rise much higher than the row of houses the proposed site would be adding onto, there is a significant green space in front of them, so there’s not really any question of any proposed development on that small site directly affecting the amenity.
The Appellant said in response that, residents are concerned about noise, potentially other areas during construction, traffic, dust. As Mr O ‘Sullivan explained in counter response, those are matters that are typically dealt with through consultation on an environmental management plan at the planning stage.
Sitting behind all the Appellant’s submissions on the value of early public engagement is the fact that there is a designated statutory stage at which consultation takes place, and that is the formal consultation for the formal planning application. The council invite the Tribunal to prefer Mr O Sullivan’s evidence. It is simply not the case that that’s a sterile exercise, why would Parliament have provided for it if it never resulted in improvements, changes to design and sometimes, as Mr O Sullivan clearly admitted, in refusal of planning permissions. It's a process of meaningful consultation that can change or even completely overflow planning applications. There was a suggestion that enhanced transparency was required in a case where the council is giving itself pre-app advice and there’s a suggestion there it might be over favourable – the council would ask the Tribunal to read the tenor of the advice and draw your own conclusions as to whether it’s overly favourable to the council as applicant. One comes to balance those competing public interests on either side of the scale, but the council ask the Tribunal to recall the passage in Stride referred to earlier which identified those competing interests in transparency on the one hand and prejudice from early disclosure on the other. At the time the council were concerned withthis appeal, it came down very clearly in favour of information remaining exempt at the pre-app stage, whereas it was appropriate to be as open and transparent as possible at the application stage. In this case, where any proposals proceed to formal planning application, the information we are discussing, the requested withheld information, would become public. If the proposal were to proceed to the next stage and if it were likely to become a reality the information would go into the public domain. If that didn’t happen, the public interest is much reduced in seeing it because it’s for a proposal that will never see the light of day and that’s built into the structure of how the council handles information… if the matter proceeds it becomes public.
Re: query from the Tribunal on – public expense in focusing pre-planning considerations so that they are paid for without pre-app work that would have to be done - money spent on experts at that stage which is in the public interest.
The witness responded that the council will depend on the nature of the proposal. It’s in the public interest for enough work to be done at the pre application stage for matters to proceed efficiently. The amount that the developer wishes to spend at that stage is more of a private matter, but the more detail the developer puts into a pre-app the more likely it is to contain sensitive information because it will have descended to the level of detail that is potentially commercially sensitive, and then the stronger the public interest in protecting what the developer regards as confidential in my submission.
When referring to the balance struck and the distinction made in Stride, that is under a different regime entirely it is nothing to do with the EIR. The council referred to the case of Lourenco v Information Commissioner & LB Barnet [2024] UKUT 111 (AAC) which brings that back to the EIR regime we are considering, tab 14. There were large development owners, the Hendon Hub, and the request sought the outline business case, early stage pre app information. By the time it was in the Upper Tribunal, there was a ground of appeal as to whether there was an error of law for the FTT not to determine whether the information was disclosable under the Local Government Act 1972. See that at para 19 where the grounds are set out, and then para 29 on p.289 the UT turned to discuss the LGA regime, and then at 33 it cited the passage from Stride that we have already considered. It is clearly established it is not within the FTT’s jurisdiction, information rights, to decide something under the Local Government Act so the ground fails. But see 35: “I am not wholly persuaded by the submission that the limits of FTT’s statutory jurisdiction necessarily preclude it (or indeed the ICO) entirely from considering, as a subsidiary matter, whether information is disclosable under the LGA. That is because if the LGA requires a public authority to disclose information, such a requirement is surely relevant to the public interest balancing exercise that must be carried out under the EIR.”
While this is an obiter comment, it is common sense and is persuasive and the reverse must also apply because if the information must also apply if the information would be exempt, that tells the Tribunal something about the relevant balance to be struck applying EIR. The council maintain that by applying Stride, pre-app advice of the kind we are concerned with here, would be exempt under the LGA and for all the reasons given in Stride, the distinction between the pre-app stage and the post application stage, the council submit is the correct balance in this case also. All the more so because those cases concern major developments giving rise to very serious public interest issues. The opposite is true in this case as we are talking about a minor piece of development of potentially only hyper local interest…more directly one property, that’s the Appellant’s. In conclusion, the council submit that the balance clearly falls in maintaining the exceptions that are engaged but also it falls in favour of any of them singularly or any combination of two of them if the Tribunal are not with the council on all three exceptions under Reg. 12 being engaged. Finally, the council submit that this isn’t a case in which presumption in favour of disclosure is going to alter that outcome. It’s simply not a finely balanced case where the Tribunal would resort to that presumption. The council invite the Tribunal to dismiss the appeal for all of the above reasons.
Conclusions:
In the DN, the Commissioner decided that, in all the circumstances, the public interest in maintaining the application of regulation 12(5)(d) outweighs the public interest in disclosure. The Tribunal look at each case on its merits and are here to consider the application of regulation 12(5)(d) EIR and do so on the comprehensive evidence and submissions from the parties as presented at this oral hearing. As the other exceptions claimed are not the subject of this appeal, we make no judgment pertaining to Regs. 12 (5)(e) or (f).
Regulation 12(5)(d) – Confidentiality of proceedings.
Regulation 12(5)(d) of the EIR states that a public authority may refuse to disclose information to the extent that its disclosure would adversely affect the confidentiality of the proceedings of that or any other public authority where such confidentiality is provided by law. Within the agreed forum of the EIR, the engagement of the exception rests on three conditions being met.
Firstly, the confidentiality referred to by the Council mustspecifically relate to the confidentiality of proceedings. The Tribunal accept the Commissioners interpretation ofConfidentiality of proceedings as ‘proceedings’ possessing a certain level of formality. This does in our view include but is not limited to formal meetings to consider mattersthat are within the authority’s jurisdiction; situations where an authorityis exercising its statutory decision-making powers; and legalproceedings. We accept and adopt the comprehensive and compelling submissions made above on behalf of the Council herein and find that the pre-app process amounts to proceedings under 12(5)(d) as envisaged for the engagement of the exemption.
Second, this confidentiality must be provided by law. The Council has presented compelling arguments supported by authorities as set out above and again we accept and adopt those arguments in support of the common law basis for providing the requisite degree of confidentiality about the pre-app process with which we are concerned in this appeal and find the information meets the threshold for common law confidentiality. This is for both the information submitted by the applicant for pre-app process and the Council’s specific response to that pre-app request.  The information is not trivial and was submitted to it voluntarily by the applicant (in this case another and separate department of the council) as part of the pre-app advice process and the Council’s specific responses to that information if disclosed would disclose that information from the applicant. We accept that another department within the council can amount to a separate entity or third party for the purposes of making a pre-app application. Again, we accept and adopt the submissions made on behalf of the council as set out above and find in that regard there is a common law duty of confidentiality and in particular, we find the exchange between the Appellant on the one hand and the Council officer on the other in the instant pre-app, does establish that expectation of confidentiality. Again, this has been dealt with in considerable detail by the above submissions and supporting authorities on behalf of the council, which we accept and adopt. As can be seen from the detailed exchange in the oral evidence at this hearing the Appellant has made no significant or material challenge in his opposition to these arguments as presented to the Tribunal herein.
Third, it must be demonstrated that disclosure would have an adverse effect on the confidentiality of the proceedings. Mr O’Sullivan as a witness has presented evidence at great length to the Tribunal, compelling evidence (see above) on behalf of the Council in support of the assertion of how and why disclosure of the withheld information would lead to adverse consequences for the council in general terms and more specifically by identifying sensitive valuations or price structures and/or creating a chilling effect whereby interested parties will avoid the pre-app process in fear that confidential information might be disclosed. The Tribunal accept these would be likely to both create a significant adverse effect on the pre-app process. The Appellant has not provided any significant material evidence to counter these important submissions.
Finally, the Tribunal must consider the balance of the public interest as regards the information that engages the exception. In doing so, we must acknowledge the EIR’s express presumption in favour of disclosure and the public interest in transparency and accountability. We further accept the concerns raised by the Appellant on his own behalf and on behalf of neighbours in the affected vicinity however it is clear to us that all relevant information (subject to any legitimate exemptions under FOIA or exceptions under EIR) included in the pre-app are in any event released to the world at large at the final Planning application stage if a full planning application is subsequently made  thereby providing appropriate transparency and accountability.
Having carefully considered all the available evidence and supporting authorities before us, the Tribunal are satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the public interest favors non-disclosure of the withheld information, the subject of this appeal.
Accordingly, we dismiss this appeal.
Brian Kennedy KC.                                                                     07 January 2025.

INTRODUCTION
This is the hearing of the applications of (a) the First and Second Defendants dated 26 July 2024 and (b) the Third and Fourth Defendants dated 10 July 2024, each seeking (i) to set aside the Order of Senior Master Cook dated 29 May 2024 whereby he granted the Claimant permission to serve the Claim Form on those Defendants out of the jurisdiction and (ii) an Order that the Claimant pay those Defendants’ costs on the indemnity basis.
That Order was made on the application of the Claimant by notice dated 10 May 2024, without notice to the Defendants, and without a hearing. The Claimant’s application was supported by the first witness statement of the Claimant’s solicitor, Christopher Howard Scott, dated 10 May 2024. No Skeleton Argument was lodged in support of the Claimant’s application. However, Mr Scott’s witness statement included a number of submissions on the law (for example, paragraphs 28, 29 and 31 state: “Each of the four Defendants is domiciled out of the jurisdiction. Neither CPR Rules 6.32 nor 6.33 apply, so the Claimant requires permission to serve the claim form out of the jurisdiction under CPR Rule 6.36 and 6.37 … the Claimant seeks to rely on both of the heads of jurisdiction or “gateways” identified at both Paragraphs 3.1(9) and (2) of Practice Direction 6B in order to serve his claim form upon the Defendants out of the jurisdiction … In the present case, the Claim falls within the scope of paragraph 3.1(9)(a) and (b) of Practice Direction 6B”; and paragraphs 46 and 47 state: “The jurisdiction of England and Wales is clearly the most appropriate place in which to bring an action in respect of this claim for the purposes of CPR Rule 6.37(3) as modified by Section 9(2) Defamation Act 2013 … the jurisdiction of England and Wales is clearly the most suitable place for the Claim to be brought.”)
No grounds were identified in the First and Second Defendants’ application notice. However, their application was supported by, among others, the witness statement dated 26 July 2024 of Gary Summers, a barrister directly instructed by those Defendants, which states at paragraph 10: “The court is respectfully invited to set aside and/or discharge the Order, and then decline jurisdiction, on each or any of four bases: (a) The Claimant did not give full and frank disclosure in its (sic) application. (b) England and Wales is not clearly the most appropriate place in which to bring this action. (c) The claim against the First and/or Second Defendants lacks merit. (d) The claim against the First and/or Second Defendants is an abuse of process.” The First and Second Defendants’ application was further supported by (i) a witness statement of the First Defendant (who gives her name therein as “Eirini Karypidou”) dated 16 August 2024 and (ii) a witness statement also dated 16 August 2024 of an individual described as “Investigator A”, who gives their address as “c/o” the chambers of Mr Summers, and who states at paragraph 1 of that witness statement “I am a professional investigator … Due to the sensitivities of this matter, I have not identified myself at this stage (as my work is still ongoing) …”. The First Defendant states at paragraph 1 of her witness statement that it is “made on behalf of myself alone”; and at paragraph 3 she lists every company of which, on her case, she is a director or in which she has a shareholding. The Second Defendant is not on that list.
The grounds identified in the Third and Fourth Defendants’ application notice were, in summary, (i) that the Claimant did not give full and frank disclosure of the merits of his claim when making his application to Senior Master Cook and (ii) that the claims against each of those Defendants were “insufficiently strong to merit the exercise of [the] jurisdiction [to try the claims against the Third and Fourth Defendants]”. That application was supported by the witness statement of the Third Defendant dated 10 July 2024, in which he describes himself as the “founder and owner of the Fourth Defendant”, and which summarises the grounds of the application in paragraph 5 as follows:
“I believe, for the reasons set out below, that the Claimant did not provide the Court with the information which I am advised he was obliged to provide in his application for permission. I also believe that the claims against me and the Fourth Defendant are so weak that even though I accept that the Court has jurisdiction over those claims as pleaded, it should decline to exercise that jurisdiction. Whether the Claimant’s failure to provide the Court with all the information he was obliged to provide was linked to a realisation of the weakness of the claims against me and the Fourth Defendant I am unable to say, but I do believe that that failure had the effect of concealing that weakness from the Court.”
The Claimant served evidence in reply, all of which is dated 17 October 2024, comprising (i) a second witness statement of Mr Scott, (ii) a witness statement of the Claimant, (iii) a witness statement of Ioannis Vrentzos, and (iv) a witness statement of Yiannis Kourtakis. This was followed by a second witness statement of Mr Summers dated 28 October 2024, served on behalf of the First Defendant, which attacked the credibility of Mr Kourtakis on the basis that he is a “professional slanderer who has been convicted of slander in Greece on several occasions”, and, further, complained that he had not mentioned that he was a defendant to a claim for criminal libel that had been brought by the First Defendant and her brother in Greece.
Mr Matthew Hodson appeared for the First and Second Defendants, Mr Ali Reza Sinai for the Third and Fourth Defendants, and Mr David Sherborne for the Claimant. I am grateful to all of them for their clear and helpful written and oral submissions.
THE PARTIES
According to paragraph 1 of the Particulars of Claim, the Claimant is a Greek national, and a businessman who has been well-known since 2017 for his involvement in and ultimate beneficial ownership of Nottingham Forest Football Club (“NFFC”), which is currently playing in the English Premier League. Not only is the Claimant, through his companies, the majority owner and chairman of NFFC, he also “attends games and other events as a prominent public figurehead for the club”. In addition, the Claimant has longstanding business relationships in London, having founded Curzon Maritime Limited, a ship-broking company, in 1991 in England and Wales, and having lived in London for many years thereafter. He maintains extensive commercial interests in England and London through the Capital Group of shipping businesses, whose brokering, insurance and legal services “all have a keen focus on London”. His personal interests in London include “longstanding personal and social connections”, and he is a member of a number of clubs (namely Mossimann’s, Oswald’s, 5 Hertford Street and The Arts Club).
According to paragraph 2 of the Particulars of Claim, the Claimant has a number of other international business interests, including in the world of shipping, media and sports. Among other things, the Claimant is the majority shareholder in Olympiacos FC, a football club that competes in the Super League Greece.
Paragraph 3 of the Particulars of Claim pleads that the First Defendant is (i) resident in Greece, (ii) the President and Managing Director of the Second Defendant, (iii) the chairperson of Aris Thessaloniki FC, a football club that also competes in the Super League Greece, and (iv) the chairperson of the Hellenic Trade Council, HETCO, an international non-governmental organisation based in Athens, Greece. According to the First Defendant, however, she is not a director of the Second Defendant (see [3] above).
Paragraph 3 of the Particulars of Claim further pleads that the Second Defendant (i) is a limited company incorporated in Cyprus whose sole shareholder is the First Defendant’s husband, Mr Dimitris Messinezis, and (ii) operates in numerous international industries such as trade, agri-foods, logistics, real estate, tourism, sports (including its ownership of Aris Thessaloniki FC), and green technologies. The Second Defendant’s case is that she has never been married to Mr Messinezis, although she accepts that he is or was her partner.
Paragraph 4 of the Particulars of Claim pleads that the Third Defendant (i) is resident in Israel, (ii) is a political consultant, and a former chief of staff to the current Prime Minister of Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu, and (iii) is the founder and chief executive officer of the Fourth Defendant, which is also based in Israel and operates as a consultancy, advising on and delivering political advocacy strategies internationally.
THE CLAIM
Paragraph 5 of the Particulars of Claim states that the Claimant’s claims against the Defendants are for (1) libel and (2) unlawful means conspiracy, and arise out of a “smear campaign” waged against the Claimant from 8 November 2023 until at least 23 March 2024 (“the Campaign”). It is pleaded that the Campaign “was organised, paid for and pursued … by the First and Second Defendants”, and that “the Third and Fourth Defendants participated in its creation and implementation, including facilitating payments and providing instruction as part of [the Campaign]”.
Paragraph 6 explains that the Claimant sets out below “the best particulars which he is able to give in relation to [the Campaign] waged against him by the Defendants” prior to “the provision by them of full disclosure and/or further information”.  Paragraph 6 continues:
“This has involved the publication of false and defamatory allegations about him:
in individual articles on a website, the homepage of which was at the URL https://nottinghamforestfire.co.uk (“the Website”);
in videos published on the YouTube channel “Nottingham Forest Fire”, using the YouTube handle @NottinghamForestFire and publishing from the URL https://www.youtube.com/@NottinghamForestFire (“the YouTube Channel”);
in posts and reply posts on ‘X’ by the ‘X’ account ‘nottinghamforestfire’, using the ‘X’ handle @nottinghamff (“the X Account”); and
on mobile billboards (“the Mobile Billboards”) driven around Nottingham, UK, by promotional digital advertising vans (“Digivans”) on 23 December 2023 (“the First Billboard”) and 7 January 2024 (“the Second Billboard”).”
Paragraphs 7 to 12 of the Particulars of Claim plead further details of each of these forms of publication, as follows:
The domain name of the Website, nottinghamforestfire.co.uk, was registered on 8 November 2023 via GoDaddy.com LLC with Nominet, the exclusive domain registrar for UK domain names. The following day, 9 November 2023, the three individual Website articles complained of in this action and particularised below (“the Website Articles”) were published on the Website in Anglicised rather than Americanised English, to appear written by and for an English audience.
The X Account was also created on 8 November 2023. More than 200 posts and reply posts were published by the X Account, making false and defamatory allegations against the Claimant. The six X posts complained of in this action (“the X Posts”) actively encouraged the reader to visit the Website, and provided the Website’s domain name or a preview image for those purposes.
The YouTube Channel was created on 27 November 2023. On that day, four of the six YouTube videos complained of in this action (“the YouTube Videos”) were published on the Channel. The fifth and sixth videos were published on 20 December 2023. The first, second, fifth and sixth videos actively encouraged the viewer to visit the Website, and included the Website’s domain name for those purposes.
The First Billboard was driven around Nottingham, UK by a low-load Digivan with the vehicle registration number (“VRN”) BW17 FFM on 23 December 2023, ahead of a football fixture between NFFC and AFC Bournemouth that same day. This Digivan and the First Billboard were operated by Promogroup Ltd, a UK-based advertising agency. In addition to the matters particularised below, the First Billboard contained a quick response (“QR”) code, which when scanned brought the user to the Website.
The Second Billboard was driven around Nottingham, UK by a Digivan with the VRN CE71 APF on 7 January 2024, ahead of a football fixture between NFFC and Blackpool FC that same day. This Digivan and the Second Billboard were operated by Communicorp UK Ltd, a UK-based marketing agency. In addition to the matters particularised below, the Second Billboard contained a quick response (“QR”) code, which when scanned brought the user to the Website.
From 9 November 2023 and at all material times thereafter, the Website contained the following contents (“the Website Contents”):
a carousel, which presented and enabled the user to access the three Website articles complained of in this action;
the three Website articles complained of in this action;
a tab titled “TIMELINE”, which when clicked presented the user with a timeline, scrollable horizontally, with entries for the years 2011, 2014, 2015, 2021 and 2023 and respectively titled “ORGANIZED CRIME”, “Drug Trafficker”, “Match Fixer”, “Sanctions Evader”, “Murderer?” and “Money Laundering”;
a panel which appeared at the bottom of the home page of the Website, which described the Claimant as “responsible for corruption” and encouraged readers to “Stand for Justice & a Corruption-Free Future in Football!” by signing up for updates and providing their first name, last name, email address and telephone number; and
a horizontal scrollbar part the way down the home page of the Website (“the Scrollbar”). The Scrollbar contained three boxes. Each box contained a photograph of the Claimant and a modified version of the logo of NFFC (“the Modified Logo”). The Modified Logo depicted the original NFFC logo’s tree as being on fire, and included the additional word “FIRE” under the word “FOREST”.
The first box contained the words “CHARGE MARINAKIS WITH HIS CRIMES[.] CORRUPTION, MATCH-FIXING, DRUG TRAFFICKING”. The second box contained the words “NOTTINGHAM FOREST F.C. NEEDS NEW OWNERSHIP! REMOVE CORRUPT EVANGELOS MARINAKIS”. The third box contained the words “WE NEED NEW OWNERSHIP!”. The Claimant will refer to the fact that when users of the Website hover their cursor over the boxes a prompt to download the image appears, indicating it is intended to be used and shared by visitors to the Website on their own social media as part of the campaign.
Paragraph 13 of the Particulars of Claim pleads that the Campaign “was deliberately designed to and did give the false impression that it was a NFFC fan-led, ‘grassroots’ campaign relating to the ownership of NFFC (“the Fake NFFC Campaign”), rather than, as was the case, a smear campaign against the Claimant involving the Defendants”. It then pleads a number of facts and matters in support of that contention, including that “the role of each of the individual Defendants in [the Campaign] was concealed from anyone who visited the Website and/or viewed any of the publications complained of in this action”.
Paragraph 14 of the Particulars of Claim pleads that the Campaign “was devised and implemented with the assistance of Harris Media LLC (“Harris Media”), a digital communications and marketing agency based in Texas, USA”. It then pleads the Claimant’s case as to the role and activities of Harris Media “pending full disclosure and/or the provision of further information”. Among other things, it is pleaded that Harris Media (i) registered the YouTube channel at the channel url @NottighamForestFire through  the email address and Google account nottinghamforestfirefangroup@gmail.com, “taking instructions from the First Defendant on the use of the YouTube channel as demonstrated in an email of 9 January 2024” and (ii) was responsible for commissioning Communicorp UK Ltd either directly or via the Yellow Rook LLC entity “as noted in instructions from the First Defendant to Harris Media of 9 January 2024 updating on [the Campaign] and referencing activity in Nottingham on 7 January”.
Paragraph 15 of the Particulars of Claim pleads that in light of the scale and wide-ranging nature of the Campaign, and the gravity of the false and defamatory allegations levelled against him, the Claimant was forced to instruct legal representatives to take steps to limit the impact of the Campaign and to secure the removal of the false and defamatory allegations made online as part of it, and that in the result (i) the first four YouTube videos complained of in this action were geo-blocked in this jurisdiction on 12 December 2023; (ii) the X Account was deactivated and permanently taken offline on 29 December 2023; (iii) the Website was taken down on 19 January 2024; and (iv) the YouTube channel and the remaining two YouTube videos were removed on approximately 23 March 2024.
Paragraphs 16 to 69 of the Particulars of Claim then plead in detail the nature and content of the 17 publications which the Claimant complains of, comprising the six X Posts, the six You Tube Videos, the First Billboard, the Second Billboard, and the three Website Articles.
Paragraphs 70 to 86 of the Particulars of Claim plead the defamatory meanings which the Claimant contends that those publications bear. There is considerable overlap between the meanings pleaded in respect of different publications. In order to demonstrate the general tenor of the meanings relied on, as well as their seriousness, it is sufficient to record that paragraph 73 pleads that in their natural and ordinary meaning, the words complained of in the First YouTube Video meant and would be understood to mean that:
the Claimant was guilty of criminal football match-fixing practices in Greece, including extortion, fraud and arson;
despite pretending publicly to be critical of the Russian Federation’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022, the Claimant had cynically and hypocritically engaged in lucrative commercial activities for his own personal gain which indirectly supported the Russian war effort in Ukraine – notably the transportation, through his company, Capital Ship Management, of Russian oil;
there are strong grounds to suspect that the Claimant is deeply and actively involved in international heroin trafficking, including through being in consistent communication with and meeting with key figures in an international heroin smuggling network, and providing substantial amounts of money to individuals themselves deeply involved in trafficking heroin;
the Claimant is the leader of a criminal organisation known as “The System”, through which he and others engaged in criminal and corrupt practices to [exercise] control over national football in Greece, including fraud, attempted extortion, bribery, intimidation.
Paragraphs 87 to 96 of the Particulars of Claim set out the Claimant’s case (1) that each of the statements complained of reached a substantial number of publishees in this jurisdiction and (2) as to how the statements complained of have caused him serious reputational harm for the purposes of section 1 of the Defamation Act 2013. In summary, the pleaded case concerning the extent of publication relies on the length of time that the publications were available, the fact that they were targeted at NFFC supporters who are predominantly based in this jurisdiction, the cross-fertilisation of the publications, the known extent of a number of the publications (for example, that “Shortly before [they were] geo-blocked in England and Wales, on 11 December 2023, the First YouTube Video had been viewed 20,000 times … [and] … the Second YouTube Video had been viewed 16,000 times”), and the “grapevine effect” (recognised in the authorities, and which applies perhaps most acutely to publications on social media). In summary, in addition to those factors relating to the nature and extent of publication, the pleaded case concerning serious harm relies on (i) the nature and extent of the Claimant’s reputation in England and Wales, (ii) the highly defamatory meanings of the words complained of, and (iii) the contention that due to the way in which the Campaign was presented the allegations concerning the Claimant were likely to have been believed by all, or a significant proportion of, the publishees.
Paragraph 97 of the Particulars of Claim pleads that “The Defendants’ single and joint liability for the [Campaign] can be demonstrated by or is to be inferred from the following facts and matters”.
Paragraphs 97.1 to 97.4 then set out the Claimant’s case against the First Defendant.
This includes the following text, which comprises the sole reference to the Second Defendant in the context of the pleaded case on “single and joint liability” for the Campaign:
The First Defendant paid Harris Media to devise and implement the Smear Campaign. This payment was made in two instalments. It was effected by the First Defendant directing and authorising the Second Defendant to pay the two instalments, which instalments the Second Defendant did in fact pay on the First Defendant’s behalf.”
Paragraph 97.5 pleads that the Third Defendant:
had a pre-existing relationship with the First Defendant;
acting with and/or through the Fourth Defendant, referred the First Defendant to Harris Media for the purposes of engaging and instructing Harris Media;
with and/or through the Fourth Defendant, earned a referral fee for having done so;
acted as a conduit for the payment of the second instalment by the Second Defendant to Harris Media for the devising and implementation of the Smear Campaign, by directing and/or authorising the Fourth Defendant to act as a conduit for that payment;
was copied into a significant amount of email correspondence between the First Defendant and Harris Media relating to the content and execution of the Smear Campaign over December 2023;
passed on instructions from the First Defendant to Harris Media;
generally referred new clients to Harris Media (on numerous occasions which the Claimant cannot presently identify pending full disclosure and/or the provision of further information);
had a pre-existing relationship with Mr Harris, on the basis of:
the Third Defendant’s and Harris Media’s involvement in the electoral campaign of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in 2015;
the Third Defendant’s and Harris Media’s involvement in a campaign run by an American organisation, “Shining City”, in 2014-2015; and
the Third Defendant’s and Harris Media’s involvement in a US-based organisation, “One Jerusalem”.”
Paragraph 97.6 pleads:
In the premises, the Claimant will contend that on the basis of the facts and matters particularised above, it is clear (or clearly to be inferred) that the Third Defendant:
had a comprehensive understanding of the services provided by Harris Media, and of the means by which it was prepared to deliver those services;
referred the First Defendant to Harris Media in the knowledge that she intended to instruct Harris Media to devise and implement a smear campaign against the Claimant;
knew about the different features of the Smear Campaign, being the Website, the Website Articles, the YouTube Videos, the X Posts and the Mobile Billboards, and about the false and defamatory allegations about the Claimant which were published through those channels; and
was therefore knowingly and actively involved in the process of publishing the statements complained of by the Claimant.”
Paragraph 97.7 pleads:
“In the premises, the Claimant will contend on the basis of the facts and matters particularised above, that it is clear (or clearly to be inferred) that the Fourth Defendant was knowingly and actively involved in the process of publishing the statements complained of by the Claimant.”
Paragraph 98 pleads that each of the publications complained of have caused the Claimant damage in the form of “grave” harm to reputation and “considerable” distress and embarrassment. Paragraph 99 contains a claim for aggravated damages.
Paragraph 100 contends that, in addition, the Claimant has sustained special damages, the best currently available particulars of which are said to be contained in an Annex to the Particulars of Claim. This Annex claims “Costs of investigating, exposing and mitigating the conspiracy up until March/April 2024” in the sum of £1,663,288.94 and “Cost[s] of continuing to deal with the conspiracy” in the estimated sum of £447,000. The first head of claim includes Counsel’s fees of £37,225.00 and solicitors’ fees of £314,015.50, investigative fees of £809,572.49, and US counsel fees of £93,096.20. The second head of claim includes solicitors’ fees of £50,000 per month for 6 months.
Paragraph 101 contains a claim for an injunction to restrain further publication.
At paragraph 102, the Particulars of Claim move on to “The Claim for Conspiracy to Injure by Unlawful Means”. Paragraphs 102 to 105 plead as follows:
The First, Second, Third and Fourth Defendants (or any two or more together) wrongfully and with intent to injure the Claimant and by unlawful means conspired and combined together to publish or cause to be published the false and defamatory allegations set out above. Paragraphs 5 to 15 and 97 above are repeated.
Pursuant to and in furtherance of this conspiracy, the First, Second, Third and Fourth Defendants published or caused to be published the said false and defamatory allegations, which had the foreseeable result of injuring or causing harm to the Claimant.
As a result of the matters set out above, the Claimant has been caused (and will continue to be caused) loss and damage, in the sum of at least £2,100,000, as identified in Schedule 1 to these Particulars of Claim. The Claimant reserves the right to seek additional losses as and when they are identified during the course of these proceedings.
By reason of the aforesaid conspiracy and by reason of the unlawful means identified above (namely the acts of publication complained of above), the First, Second, Third and Fourth Defendants are jointly and severally liable to the Claimant in damages for conspiracy.”
Paragraph 106 contains a claim for interest under the Supreme Court Act 1981, and paragraph 107 a further claim for an injunction to restrain future acts of conspiracy.
The prayer for relief seeks damages, interest, injunctions, and “further or other relief”.
THE LEGAL FRAMEWORK
There was no dispute between the parties as to the applicable legal principles.
In Soriano v Forensic News LLC [2021] EWCA Civ 1952; [2022] QB 533 (“Soriano”), Warby LJ summarised the law on service outside the jurisdiction and forum conveniens, at [11]-[12], as follows:
This is well established. For present purposes, it can be adequately distilled as follows. The court can only give permission to serve a claim on a defendant outside the jurisdiction if it meets three conditions.
The first is that the claim is of a kind that falls within one of the ""gateways"" set out in CPR PD 6B (""the Gateway Requirement""). On this question, the claimant has to satisfy the court that he has a good arguable case or, as it is sometimes put, the better of the argument. This connotes ""more than a serious issue to be tried or a real prospect of success, but not as much as proof on the balance of probabilities"": AstraZeneca UK Ltd v Albemarle International Corpn [2011] 1 All ER (Comm) 510, para 24 (Hamblen J).
Secondly, the claimant must satisfy the court that he has a real as opposed to a fanciful prospect of success on the claim (""the Merits Test""). One way this has been put is that the claimant has to show that any ""reverse"" summary judgment application would fail.
Thirdly, ""The court will not give permission unless it is satisfied that England and Wales is the proper place in which to bring the claim"": CPR r 6.37(3) (""the Forum Test""). This is normally resolved by reference to the ""Spiliada"" principles as to the appropriate forum or (in the classic language) forum conveniens for the trial of the claim: see Spiliada Maritime Corpn v Cansulex Ltd (The Spiliada) [1987] AC 460, 478-480 (Lord Goff of Chieveley). The question is whether this jurisdiction is ""clearly or distinctly"" the most appropriate. The appropriate forum is the one in which the case ""may most suitably be tried for the interests of all the parties and for the ends of justice"". The first thing to consider is what is the ""natural forum"", namely the one ""with which the action [has] the most real and substantial connection"". If the court concludes that another forum is as suitable or more suitable than England, it will normally refuse permission. Again, the issue is not determined on the balance of probabilities; the claimant's task is to show that he has the better of the argument on the point. If he fails to do so, the application will be dismissed.
A claimant seeking permission to serve outside the jurisdiction always bears the legal burden of proof on all these issues. That is so whether the matter is being considered on an application by the claimant at the initial, without notice stage, or at the hearing of a subsequent application by the defendant to set aside an order permitting service outside the jurisdiction. But a defendant challenging such an order needs to identify some other forum which does have jurisdiction; and even the initial application requires there to be another candidate with the requisite jurisdiction: Unwired Planet International Ltd v Huawei Technologies (UK) Ltd [2020] Bus LR 2422, paras 96-97. Where the claimant's contention that the case is a proper one for service out is disputed by the defendant on a specific ground the defendant bears an evidential burden in relation to that ground: see AstraZeneca (above) at paras 33–39 (Hamblen J).”
In Kaefer Aislamientos SA de CV v AMS Drilling Mexico SA de CV [2019] EWCA Civ 10; [2019] 1 WLR 3514, Davis LJ said at [124] of applications of the kind with which the Court is presently concerned: “This is by its nature an interlocutory process, not in any way concerned with a final conclusion on the facts or merits”.
So far as concerns the “Gateway Requirement”, CPR 6.36 provides:
“In any proceedings to which rule 6.32 or 6.33 does not apply, the claimant may serve a claim form out of the jurisdiction with the permission of the court if any of the grounds set out in paragraph 3.1 of Practice Direction 6B apply.”
In Brownlie v Four Seasons Holdings International [2017] UKSC 80; [2018] 1 WLR 192, Lord Sumption JSC said at [28] “in different ways all the jurisdictional gateways in the Practice Direction are concerned to identify some substantial and not merely casual or adventitious link between the cause of action and England.”
In the present case, the Claimant relies on the following grounds set out in paragraph 3.1 of Practice Direction 6B:
A claim is made for an injunction ordering the defendant to do or refrain from doing an act within the jurisdiction.
A claim is made in tort where –
damage was sustained, or will be sustained, within the jurisdiction;
damage which has been or will be sustained results from an act committed, or likely to be committed, with the jurisdiction; or
the claim is governed by the law of England and Wales.”
With regard to the first of those grounds, in Ahuja v Politika Novine I Magazine D.O.O [2015] EWHC 3380 (QB); [2016] 1 WLR 1414, Sir Michael Tugendhat said at [23] that “the discretion to grant permission will not be exercised unless an injunction is a genuine part of the substantive relief sought and there is a reasonable prospect of an injunction being granted”, and at [66] that “An injunction is a normal remedy to give to a successful libel claimant … [and] an English court is the only court that would grant an injunction specifically restraining publication in England.”
So far as concerns the “Merits Test”, all parties agreed that the appropriate approach for the Court to adopt was that set out in Okpabi v Royal Dutch Shell Plc [2021] UKSC 3; [2021] 1 WLR 1294 by Lord Hamblen at [22] (emphasis added):
“Where, as will often be the case where permission for service out of the jurisdiction is sought, there are particulars of claim, the analytical focus should be on the particulars of claim and whether, on the basis that the facts there alleged are true, the cause of action asserted has a real prospect of success. Any particulars of claim or witness statement setting out details of the claim will be supported by a statement of truth. Save in cases where allegations of fact are demonstrably untrue or unsupportable, it is generally not appropriate for a defendant to dispute the facts alleged through evidence of its own. Doing so may well just show that there is a triable issue.”
The core elements of the cause of action for libel were described by Warby LJ in Soriano at [15] as follows:
“At common law, a cause of action for libel is made out by proof that the defendant was responsible for the publication to one or more third parties of a written statement that bore a defamatory meaning about the claimant. Statute has added a requirement that publication caused serious harm to the claimant's reputation or is likely to do so: Defamation Act 2013, s 1(1). If this much is established, the burden shifts to the defendant to raise a defence. So defamation remains a relatively simple tort to prove …”
The core elements of the cause of action for the tort of conspiracy to injure by unlawful means were described by Nicklin J in MBR Acres Ltd & Ors v Free The MBR Beagles & Ors [2022] EWHC 1677 (KB) at [33]-[34] as follows:
A conspiracy to injure by unlawful means is actionable where a claimant proves that s/he has suffered loss or damage as a result of unlawful action taken pursuant to a combination, or agreement, between the defendant and another person or persons, to injure him or her by unlawful means whether or not it is the predominant purpose of the defendant to do so: Kuwait Oil Tanker Co. v - Al Bader [2000] 2 All ER (Comm) 271 [108].
The elements that a claimant must prove for unlawful means conspiracy can be broken down as follows:
concerted actions between two or more persons (the “combination”);
use of unlawful means;
knowledge of the unlawfulness;
intention to injure the claimant, whether or not it is the predominant purpose of the defendant to do so;
overt act in pursuance of the agreement or undertaking;
loss or damage as a result.”
At [36], Nicklin J cited further passages from the judgment of Nourse LJ in the Kuwait Oil Tanker case, including the following:
A further feature of the tort of conspiracy, which is also found in criminal conspiracies, is that … it is not necessary to show that there is anything in the nature of an express agreement, whether formal or informal. It is sufficient if two or more persons combine with a common intention, or, in other words, that they deliberately combine, albeit tacitly, to achieve a common end.
Thus it is not necessary for the conspirators all to join the conspiracy at the same time, but … the parties to it must be sufficiently aware of the surrounding circumstances and share the same object for it properly to be said that they were acting in concert at the time of the acts complained of …
In most cases it will be necessary to scrutinise the acts relied upon in order to see what inferences can be drawn as to the existence or otherwise of the alleged conspiracy or combination. It will be the rare case in which there will be evidence of the agreement itself …”
Earlier in the same judgment, in passages to which none of the parties before me made reference, Nicklin J addressed the pleading requirements in relation to such a claim:
Allegations of conspiracy made in a civil claim are serious … As such, there are stricter rules as to the pleading requirements of what might be thought to be more routine allegations.
I take the following principles from Ivy Technology v Martin [2019] EWHC 2510 (Comm) per Andrew Henshaw QC:
[12]  Conspiracy to injure must be pleaded to a high standard, particularly where the allegations include dishonesty:
Allegations of conspiracy to injure “must be clearly pleaded and clearly proved by convincing evidence” (Jarman & Platt Ltd v I Barget Ltd [1977] FSR 260, 267).
The more serious the allegations made, the more important it is for the case to be set out clearly and with adequate particularity Secretary of State for Trade and Industry v Swan [2003] EWHC 1780 (Ch) [22]-[24]; CPR PD 16 §8.2 in respect of the obligations on a party pleading dishonesty; Mullarkey v Broad [2007] EWHC 3400 (Ch); [2008] 1 BCLC 638 [40]-[47] on the burden and standard of proof for such claims and reiterating the well-established principle that an allegation of dishonesty must be pleaded clearly and with particularity (citing Belmont Finance Corp v Williams Furniture [1979] Ch 250, 268).
Unlawful means conspiracy is a grave allegation, which ought not to be lightly made, and like fraud must be clearly pleaded and requires a high standard of proof: CEF Holdings v Mundey [2012] EWHC 1534 (QB); [2012] IRLR 912 [74].
Where a conspiracy claim alleges dishonesty, then “all the strictures that apply to pleading fraud” are directly engaged, i.e. it is necessary to plead all the specific facts and circumstances supporting the inference of dishonesty by the defendants: ED&F Man Sugar v T&L Sugars [2016] EWHC 272 (Comm).
As to the substantive elements of the tort:
“To establish liability for assisting another person in the commission of a tort [common design], it is necessary to show that the defendant (i) acted in a way which furthered the commission of the tort by the other person and (ii) did so in pursuance of a common design to do,
or secure the doing of, the acts which constituted the tort…
The elements of this tort [conspiracy] are a combination or agreement between the defendant and another person pursuant to which unlawful action is taken which causes loss or damage to the claimant and is intended or expected by the defendant to do so (whether or not this was the defendant’s predominant purpose).” (Marathon Asset Management LLP v Seddon [2017] IRLR 503 [132] and [135]).
As to the requirements of pleading fraud or other discreditable conduct, the approach was set out in Portland Stone Firms Limited v Barclays Bank [2018] EWHC 2341 (QB) per Stuart-Smith J:
[25] Where, as here, a Claimant wishes to amend to plead fraud and the application is opposed, it is material to bear in mind the approach that the Court routinely takes to proving fraud in civil litigation. A sufficient summary for present purposes is provided by Fiona Trust & Holding Corp v Privalov [2010] EWHC 3199 (Comm) [1438]-[1439] per Andrew Smith J:
‘It is well established that “cogent evidence is required to justify a finding of fraud or other discreditable conduct”: per Moore-Bick LJ in Jafari-Fini -v- Skillglass Ltd [2007] EWCA Civ 261 [73]. This principle reflects the court’s conventional perception that it is generally not likely that people will engage in such conduct: “where a claimant seeks to prove a case of dishonesty, its inherent improbability means that, even on the civil burden of proof, the evidence needed to prove it must be all the stronger”, per Rix LJ in Markel -v- Higgins [2009] EWCA 790 [50]. The question remains one of the balance of probability, although typically, as Ungoed-Thomas J put it in In re Dellow’s Will Trusts [1964] 1 WLR 415, 455 (cited by Lord Nicholls in In re H [1996] AC 563, 586H), “The more serious the allegation the more cogent the evidence required to overcome the unlikelihood of what is alleged and thus to prove it”…
…Thus in the Jafari-Fini [49], Carnwath LJ recognised an obvious qualification to the application of the principle, and said, “Unless it is dealing with known fraudsters, the court should start from a strong presumption that the innocent explanation is more likely to be correct.”’
[26]  This summary is consistent with many other decisions of high authority which establish that pleadings of fraud should be subjected to close scrutiny and that it is not possible to infer dishonesty from facts that are equally consistent with honesty: see, for example, Mukhtar -v- Saleem [2018] EWHC 1729 (QB); Elite Property Holdings Ltd -v- Barclays Bank [2017] EWHC 2030 (QB); Three Rivers DC -v- The Governor and Company of Barclays of England (No.3) [2003] 2 AC 1 [186] per Lord Millett...
[27]  One of the features of claims involving fraud or deceit is the prospect that the Defendant will, if the underlying allegation is true, have tried to shroud his conduct in secrecy. This has routinely been addressed in cases involving allegations that a defendant has engaged in anti-competitive arrangements. In such cases, the Court adopts what is called a generous approach to pleadings. The approach was summarised by Flaux J in Bord Na Mona Horticultural Ltd & Anr -v- British Polythene Industries Plc [2012] EWHC 3346 (Comm) [29]ff. Flaux J set out the principles in play as described by Sales J in Nokia Corporation -v- AU Optronics Corporation [2012] EWHC 731 (Ch) [62]-[67], which included the existence of a tension between (a) the impulse to ensure that claims are fully and clearly pleaded, and (b) the impulse to ensure that justice is done and a claimant is not prevented by overly strict and demanding rules of pleading from introducing a claim which may prove to be properly made out at trial but may be shut out by the law of limitation if the claimant is to be forced to wait until he has full particulars before launching a claim. Sales J indicated that this tension was to be resolved by “allowing a measure of generosity in favour of a claimant”.”
So far as concerns “The Forum Test”, CPR 6.37(3) provides:
“The Court will not give permission unless satisfied that England and Wales is the proper place in which to bring the claim.”
Further, section 9 of the Defamation Act 2013 provides:
“Action against a person not domiciled in the UK or a Member State etc
This section applies to an action for defamation against a person who is not domiciled — (a) in the United Kingdom; (b) in another Member State; or (c) in a state which is for the time being a contracting party to the Lugano Convention.
A court does not have jurisdiction to hear and determine an action to which this section applies unless the court is satisfied that, of all the places in which the statement complained of has been published, England and Wales is clearly the most appropriate place in which to bring an action in respect of the statement.
The references in subsection (2) to the statement complained of include references to any statement which conveys the same, or substantially the same, imputation as the statement complained of.”
These provisions were considered by Warby LJ in Soriano at [19]-[21] and [60]-[61]:
In some ways this language resembles that of the common law test of forum conveniens, but it is plainly intended to establish a different approach. At a minimum, it modifies the common law position in two respects: (a) by requiring the court to answer the question of which jurisdiction is ""clearly the most appropriate"" by considering ""all the places in which the statement complained of has been published"" and (b) by treating any statement that conveys substantially the same imputation as if it were a ""statement complained of"".
Section 9 has been considered in a handful of cases to date: Ahuja v Politika Novine I Magazini D.O.O [2015] EWHC 3380 (QB), [2016] 1 WLR 1414 (Sir Michael Tugendhat); Huda v Wells [2017] EWHC 2553 (QB), [2018] EMLR 7 (Nicklin J); Wright v Ver [2019] EWHC 2094 (QB) (Nicklin J), affirmed [2020] EWCA Civ 673, [2020] 1 WLR 3913; Al Sadik v Al Sadik [2019] EWHC 2717 (QB), [2020] EMLR 7 (Julian Knowles J); and Kim v Lee [2020] EWHC 2162 (QB) (Julian Knowles J).
Some uncontroversial propositions emerge from these cases:
The claimant bears the burden of satisfying the court that England is the most appropriate place in which to bring the claim: Wright v Ver (CA) [60].
When determining that question, the court must consider all the ""places"", which in this context means jurisdictions, in which there has been publication of ""the statement complained of"", giving that term the expanded meaning identified in s 9(3): Ahuja [31], [41]; Wright v Ver (CA) [61].
Relevant factors for consideration will include the best evidence available to show what all those places are; the number of times the statement has been published in each jurisdiction; and the amount of damage to the claimant's reputation in England and Wales compared with elsewhere: Ahuja [31]; Wright v Ver (CA) [61-63].
Other relevant factors are likely to include the availability of fair judicial processes in the other jurisdictions in which publication occurred, the available remedies from the courts of the other jurisdictions, the costs of pursuing proceedings in each possible jurisdiction, other factors that might impact on access to justice - for example language barriers - and the location of likely witnesses, as well as the relative expense of suing in different jurisdictions; Ahuja [31]; Wright v Ver (CA) [64-65].
This list of factors is non-exhaustive because the relevant multifactorial question to be answered by the court is whether it can be shown that England and Wales is clearly the most appropriate jurisdiction in which to bring the claim. This will be fact-specific, but it is likely to require the court to make the best assessment that it can on the evidence whether any competing jurisdiction is an appropriate place to bring the claim: Wright v Ver (CA) [65].
… the standard of proof which a claimant must meet on an issue under s 9 is the well-established standard for forum conveniens disputes, of a good arguable case. That is because, as I have explained, s 9 should not be treated as a fresh stand-alone provision of unique character but rather as a tailored modification of the established regime, and it does not purport to alter the standard of proof.
I see no good reason for adopting any rigid rule about the nature of the evidence that either party will be required to adduce on a contest under s 9. It is sufficient to say that the court must be satisfied of the matters specified in the section, that the legal burden of doing so rests on the claimant, and that the claimant has a duty of full and frank disclosure at the without notice stage. Whether the evidence adduced in a given case is enough to meet these requirements will depend on the circumstances of the case. This will ordinarily be a matter for the assessment of the Judge, and not apt for review on an appeal…”
Finally, the law concerning the duty to make full and frank disclosure which rests on an applicant on a without notice application was summarised as follows by Warby J in Sloutsker v Romanova [2015] EWHC 545 (QB); [2015] 2 Costs LR 321, at [51]:
An applicant for permission to serve proceedings outside the jurisdiction is under the duty of full and frank disclosure which applies on all applications without notice.
The duty requires the applicant to make a full and fair disclosure of those facts which it is material for the court to know: Brinks Mat v Elcombe [1988] 1 WLR 1350, 1356 (1) and (2) (Ralph Gibson LJ). Put another way, disclosure should be made of “any matter, which, if the other party were represented, that party would wish the court to be aware of”: ABCI v Banque Franco-Tunisienne [1996] 1 Lloyd's Rep 485, 489 (Waller J).
Non-disclosure of material facts on an application made without notice may lead to the setting aside of the order obtained, without examination of the merits. It is important to uphold the requirement of full and frank disclosure.
But the court has a discretion to set aside or to continue the order. Whether the fact not disclosed is of sufficient materiality to justify or require immediate discharge of the order without examination of the merits depends on the importance of the fact to the issues that were to be decided. The answer to the question whether the non-disclosure was innocent is an important, though not decisive, consideration. See Brinks Mat at pp1357 (6) and (7) and 1358 (Balcombe LJ).
In the context of permission for service outside the jurisdiction the court has a discretion to set aside the order for service and require a fresh application, or to treat the claim form as validly served and deal with the non-disclosure by a costs order: NML Capital Ltd v Republic of Argentina [2011] UKSC 31, [2011] 2 AC 495, [136] (Lord Collins).”
The relevant principles were also summarised by Carr J in Tugushev v Orlov (No. 2) [2019] EWHC 2031 (Comm), at [7]:
The duty of an applicant for a without notice injunction is to make full and accurate disclosure of all material facts and to draw the court's attention to significant factual, legal and procedural aspects of the case;
It is a high duty and of the first importance to ensure the integrity of the court's process. It is the necessary corollary of the court being prepared to depart from the principle that it will hear both sides before reaching a decision, a basic principle of fairness. Derogation from that principle is an exceptional course adopted in cases of extreme urgency or the need for secrecy. The court must be able to rely on the party who appears alone to present the argument in a way which is not merely designed to promote its own interests but in a fair and even-handed manner, drawing attention to evidence and arguments which it can reasonably anticipate the absent party would wish to make;
Full disclosure must be linked with fair presentation. The judge must be able to have complete confidence in the thoroughness and objectivity of those presenting the case for the applicant. Thus, for example, it is not sufficient merely to exhibit numerous documents;
An applicant must make proper enquiries before making the application. He must investigate the cause of action asserted and the facts relied on before identifying and addressing any likely defences. The duty to disclose extends to matters of which the applicant would have been aware had reasonable enquiries been made. The urgency of a particular case may make it necessary for evidence to be in a less tidy or complete form than is desirable. But no amount of urgency or practical difficulty can justify a failure to identify the relevant cause of action and principal facts to be relied on;
Material facts are those which it is material for the judge to know in dealing with the application as made. The duty requires an applicant to make the court aware of the issues likely to arise and the possible difficulties in the claim, but need not extend to a detailed analysis of every possible point which may arise. It extends to matters of intention and for example to disclosure of related proceedings in another jurisdiction;
Where facts are material in the broad sense, there will be degrees of relevance and a due sense of proportion must be kept. Sensible limits have to be drawn, particularly in more complex and heavy commercial cases where the opportunity to raise arguments about non-disclosure will be all the greater. The question is not whether the evidence in support could have been improved (or one to be approached with the benefit of hindsight). The primary question is whether in all the circumstances its effect was such as to mislead the court in any material respect;
A defendant must identify clearly the alleged failures, rather than adopt a scatter gun approach. A dispute about full and frank disclosure should not be allowed to turn into a mini-trial of the merits;
In general terms it is inappropriate to seek to set aside a freezing order for non-disclosure where proof of non-disclosure depends on proof of facts which are themselves in issue in the action, unless the facts are truly so plain that they can be readily and summarily established, otherwise the application to set aside the freezing order is liable to become a form of preliminary trial in which the judge is asked to make findings (albeit provisionally) on issues which should be more properly reserved for the trial itself;
If material non-disclosure is established, the court will be astute to ensure that a claimant who obtains injunctive relief without full disclosure is deprived of any advantage he may thereby have derived;
Whether or not the non-disclosure was innocent is an important consideration, but not necessarily decisive. Immediate discharge (without renewal) is likely to be the court's starting point, at least when the failure is substantial or deliberate. It has been said on more than one occasion that it will only be in exceptional circumstances in cases of deliberate non-disclosure or misrepresentation that an order would not be discharged;
The court will discharge the order even if the order would still have been made had the relevant matter(s) been brought to its attention at the without notice hearing. This is a penal approach and intentionally so, by way of deterrent to ensure that applicants in future abide by their duties;
The court nevertheless has a discretion to continue the injunction (or impose a fresh injunction) despite a failure to disclose. Although the discretion should be exercised sparingly, the overriding consideration will always be the interests of justice. Such consideration will include examination of i) the importance of the facts not disclosed to the issues before the judge ii) the need to encourage proper compliance with the duty of full and frank disclosure and to deter non-compliance iii) whether or not and to what extent the failure was culpable iv) the injustice to a claimant which may occur if an order is discharged leaving a defendant free to dissipate assets, although a strong case on the merits will never be a good excuse for a failure to disclose material facts;
The interests of justice may sometimes require that a freezing order be continued and that a failure of disclosure can be marked in some other way, for example by a suitable costs order. The court thus has at its disposal a range of options in the event of non-disclosure.”
That summary was approved by the Court of Appeal in Derma Med Ltd v Ally [2024] EWCA Civ 175 (see Males LJ, with whom Bean LJ and Lewis LJ agreed, at [29]). At [30], Males LJ said “Although this was said in the context of an application for a freezing order, the principles are of general application.”
On behalf of the First and Second Defendants, Mr Hodson also made reference to Masri v Consolidated Contractors International Co SAL [2011] EWHC 1780 (Comm) - in which Burton J expressed the view at [58] that the duty of full and frank disclosure may apply “particularly where [the without notice application] is made on paper where the judge is left to consider on his own in his or her room what may often be a pile of undigested exhibits” -  and to Ophthalmic Innovations International (UK) Ltd v Ophthalmic Innovations International Inc [2004] EWHC 2948 (Ch).
The particular point that emerges from those cases relates to the relevance of foreign proceedings. In the latter case, in which Lawrence Collins J set aside the order granting permission to serve proceedings out of the jurisdiction, he stated at [45] that “the existence of overlapping proceedings in a foreign jurisdiction between the same or related parties (whether pending or prospective) is likely to be a particularly relevant matter which in normal circumstances must be disclosed, and the non-disclosure of which may well of itself lead to the order for permission being set aside”.
I should add that the duty of fair presentation was described in Fundo Soberano de Angola v Jose Filomeno dos Santos [2018] EWHC 2199 (Comm) by Popplewell J at [52] as follows:
“The evidence and argument must be presented and summarised in a way which, taken as a whole, is not misleading or unfairly one-sided. In a complex case with a large volume of documents, it is not enough if disclosure is made in some part of the material, even if amongst that which the judge is invited to read, if that aspect of the evidence and its significance is obscured by an unfair summary or presentation of the case. The task of the judge on a without notice application in complex cases such as the present is not an easy one. He or she is often under time constraints which render it impossible to read all the documentary evidence on which the application is based, or to absorb all the nuances of what is read in advance, without the signposting which is contained in the main affidavit and skeleton argument. It is essential to the efficient administration of justice that the judge can rely on having been given a full and fair summary of the available evidence and competing considerations which are relevant to the decision.”
I should also add that further guidance as to the correct approach to be adopted by the parties and the Court towards allegations of material non-disclosure was provided in Mex Group Worldwide Ltd v Stewart Owen Ford and others [2024] EWCA Civ 959:
By Males LJ at [112]:
“… I sought in National Bank Trust v Yurov [2016] EWHC 1913 (Comm) at [14] and [15] to encourage a degree of restraint and a sense of proportion on the part of those seeking to set aside without notice orders on this ground, but it appears that the message has not got through. In this case we have been prepared to separate the wheat from the chaff, but I would suggest a different approach for the future. In future, if the court is presented with a long shopping list of alleged failures of disclosure, with no attempt made to identify the relatively few points which really matter, it should simply decline to consider the issue at all.”
By Coulson LJ at [127]-[128]:
“It is almost always the position that, no matter how big the case or how complex the underlying issues, a defendant's case that the claimant failed to make full and frank disclosure at the ex parte hearing will stand or fall on no more than a handful of alleged failures. That is because, if the 'big ticket' allegations of failure are not established, or are established but found to be immaterial, then the less significant failures will not bridge the gap. It is the law of diminishing returns…
Accordingly, those preparing this sort of attack in the future should ensure that they concentrate their efforts on alleged failures of disclosure which are clear-cut and obviously important. Quality not quantity should be the watchword. The failure to follow that course … means that there is a real risk that the best points become buried in an avalanche of trivia …”
THE GATEWAY REQUIREMENT
As appears from the summary of the grounds of their applications in [3] and [4] above, none of the Defendants contend that the Claimant does not have a good arguable case that his claim falls within the grounds set out in paragraphs 3.1(2) and 3.1(9) of Practice Direction 6B. As Mr Sherborne submitted, this is unsurprising.
First, the claims for injunctions in respect of both the cause of action for defamation and the cause of action for conspiracy to injure by unlawful means are clearly pleaded, and there is no obvious basis on which, on the materials at present available, it could be contended (a) that those claims are not a genuine part of the substantive relief sought by the Claimant or (b) that there is no real prospect that the injunctions sought may be granted. Second, in respect of both causes of action, the Claimant relies on damage said to be have been sustained by him within this jurisdiction (and, in addition, the Particulars of Claim do not rely on foreign law, and none of the Defendants suggest that those causes of action are not governed by the law of England and Wales).
THE MERITS TEST
The First and Second Defendants
On behalf of both the First Defendant and the Second Defendant, Mr Hodson argued that the Claimant’s claims had no real prospect of success. Mr Hodson referred to the points concerning the strength of the Claimant’s case contained in paragraphs 49 to 61 of Mr Summers’ witness statement, which Mr Hodson summarised as being (1) that the Claimant had no real prospect of satisfying the threshold requirement of serious harm contained in section 1 of the Defamation Act 2013, and (2) that there were “clear” defences that (i) the imputations conveyed by the statements complained of are substantially true (see section 2, ibid) and (ii) the statements complained of were protected by the public interest defence (see section 4, ibid). Mr Hodson accepted, for the purposes of the First and Second Defendants’ current application, that these defences raised “triable issues”, from which I understood that he accepted that the Claimant had a real prospect of success in defeating them. He argued, however, that the question of serious harm could be determined summarily, against the Claimant.
Mr Hodson’s core submission was that “Taking the Claimant’s case at its highest, there is little to no evidence of serious harm”. Mr Hodson focussed on the Annexe to the Particulars of Claim. He described this as a “costs-building exercise of extraordinary proportions”, which he suggested the Claimant had embarked upon “to manufacture some appearance of damage where there is none”. He submitted that the heads of loss claimed related to the Claimant’s attempts to respond to the publications complained of, and not to loss or harm to reputation resulting from the publications, and in any event were disproportionate. Overall, the game was not worth the candle.
Mr Sherborne’s core response to these submissions was that the Claimant’s pleaded case on serious harm has at the very least a real prospect of success. In fact, in his Skeleton Argument, Mr Sherborne addressed in some detail a number of points which he, not unreasonably, understood were being advanced on behalf of the First and Second Defendants in light of the contents of Mr Summers’ witness statement. For example, the suggestion that the Claimant had a pre-existing reputation in this jurisdiction that was so bad that the publications complained of could not have caused him further serious harm was disputed by Mr Sherborne both on the facts (in that reliance was placed on other publications which were “[not] properly particularised or substantiated”) and as a matter of law (including that evidence of other publications making the same allegation(s) as the statement(s) complained of is inadmissible as proof of a pre-existing bad reputation: see Associated Newspapers Ltd v Dingle [1964] AC 371). Little if any mention was made of these points by Mr Hodson at the hearing.
I have no hesitation in preferring Mr Sherborne’s submissions on this issue. As Lord Sumption explained in Lachaux v Independent Print Ltd [2019] UKSC 27, [2020] AC 612 at [14], whether a statement has caused “serious harm” falls to be established “by reference to the impact which the statement is shown actually to have had”, and that, in turn, “depends on a combination of the inherent tendency of the words and their actual impact on those to whom they were communicated”. Further: (i) the assessment of harm of a defamatory statement in not simply “a numbers game” (see Mardas v New York Times Co [2009] EMLR 8, Eady J at [15]); (ii) indeed “Reported cases have shown that very serious harm to a reputation can be caused by the publication of a defamatory statement to one person” (see Sobrinho v Impresa Publishing SA [2016] EMLR 12, Dingemans J at [47]); (iii) “Depending on the circumstances of the case, the claimant may be able to satisfy section 1 without calling any evidence, by relying on the inferences of serious harm to reputation properly to be drawn from the level of the defamatory meaning of the words and the nature and extent of their publication” (see Doyle v Smith [2019] EMLR 15, Warby J at [117]); and (iv) decided cases recognise the “grapevine effect” whereby the defamatory imputations complained of percolate beyond the original publishees, adding to the harm arising from publication.
Leaving aside altogether that this is ultimately an issue for trial on the evidence that will by then be available, the gravity of the allegations complained of and the nature and extent of each publication pleaded is such that, in my judgment, on the materials at present before the Court, an inference of “serious harm” appears hard to resist.
Mr Hodson’s reliance on the Annexe to the Particulars of Claim is misplaced: first, general damages for harm to reputation are additional to the contents of the Annexe; second, if the Claimant’s pleaded case succeeds, the level of general damages to which he would, on the face of it, be entitled is such that, from the perspective of compensating for harm to his reputation alone, the claim seems well worth bringing, to say nothing of compensation for distress or the element of vindication which is typically of significance in claims for defamation; and, third, even if arguably excessive, the claims in the Annexe are not obviously baseless either in fact or in law.
Although that means that the Claimant succeeds on the Merits Test as against the First Defendant, Mr Hodson had further points, which relate to the Second Defendant alone.
The first of these points is that the only concrete pleaded allegation made against the Second Defendant is (see paragraph 97.2 of the Particulars of Claim) that the Second Defendant participated in payment to Harris Media by two instalments. It is pleaded that this was “effected” by the First Defendant “directing and authorising” the Second Defendant to pay these instalments, which it did “on the First Defendant’s behalf”. So far as the Second Defendant is concerned, therefore, the allegations against the First and Second Defendants contained in paragraph 5 of the Particulars of Claim of “organising, paying for, and pursuing” the Campaign boil down to making two payments to Harris Media at the behest of the First Defendant and on her behalf.
Mr Hodson accepted that, at common law, liability for publication “extends to any person who participated in, secured, or authorised the publication” (see Gatley on Libel and Slander, 13th edn, para 7-010). In addition, in Bataille v Newland [2002] EWHC 1692 (QB) Eady J said at [25]:
“To participate in a publication in such a way as to be liable in accordance with the law of defamation is not, I should emphasise, to be equated with being a source of the information contained within the relevant document. There are various acts that can give rise to legal responsibility, for example, encouraging the primary author, supplying him with information intending or knowing that it will be re-published, or, if one is in a position to do so, instructing or authorising him to publish it.”
Mr Hodson submitted, however, that making payments in the circumstances and manner alleged against the Second Defendant is insufficient to give rise to liability. At highest, the allegations against the Second Defendant concern acts of facilitation.
In this regard, if the Second Defendant is not liable as a primary tortfeasor, then, as stated in Sea Shepherd UK v Fish & Fish Ltd [2015] UKSC 10, [2015] 1 AC 1229, Lord Kerr JSC at [21]-[22]
“We are concerned with a different category in which the defendant, D, has allegedly assisted the principal tortfeasor, P, in the commission of tortious acts ...
To establish accessory liability in tort it is not enough to show that D did acts which facilitated P’s commission of the tort. D will be jointly liable with P if they combined to do or secure the doing of acts which constituted a tort. This requires proof of two elements. D must have acted in a way which furthered the commission of the tort by P; and D must have done so in pursuance of a common design to do or secure the doing of the acts which constituted the tort. I do not consider it necessary or desirable to gloss the principle further.”
To like effect, in Credit Lyonnais Bank Nederland NV v Export Credits Guarantee Department [1998] 1 Lloyd's Rep 19, Hobhouse LJ said at 46:
“Mere assistance, even knowing assistance, does not suffice to make the ‘secondary’ party jointly liable as a joint tortfeasor with the primary party. What he does must go further. He must have conspired with the primary party or procured or induced his commission of the tort (my first category); or he must have joined in the common design pursuant to which the tort was committed (my third category).”
Mr Sherborne responded, first, that the pleaded case against the Second Defendant does amount to a claim that the Second Defendant “participated in, secured, or authorised” each of the publications complained of. Second, he emphasised that the facts and matters set out in paragraph 97 of the Particulars of Claim are the best particulars that the Claimant can give in circumstances where the role of each of the Defendants was concealed in the manner set out in paragraph 13 of the Particulars of Claim (as to which, see [15] above). Third, he submitted that the Second Defendant is the owner of a Greek football club which is a rival to the Greek football club owned by the Claimant, and that these matters are “not totally unrelated to” the Campaign.
On the first of those points, I agree with Mr Hodson. I do not consider that the pleaded case against the Second Defendant sets out a basis for liability at common law either as a primary tortfeasor or as a joint tortfeasor with all or any of the other Defendants.
Nor do I find the second of Mr Sherborne’s points persuasive. It is clear from the contents of the Annexe to the Particulars of Claim that a very substantial sum (it would appear more than £800,000) has been expended by the Claimant on investigating the matters complained of in these proceedings. It is also clear from the hearing papers that proceedings for the production of documents were brought against Harris Media in the USA, and indeed it would seem that much of the material upon which paragraph 97 of the Particulars of Claim is based was obtained as a result of those proceedings. It does not follow, as the Defendants’ Counsel submitted at times, and as Mr Sherborne rightly disputed, that nothing further may emerge on disclosure in the present case. Nevertheless, the Claimant has substantially more visibility as to the role played by different Defendants in the actions complained of than would normally be true in a case of this kind. Further, the Claimant cannot ask for generosity with regard to his pleaded case on grounds of lack of access to financial resources or legal advice. Even if the approach which applies in claims of fraud or deceit ought also to be applied to a claim for joint and several liability for publication in the circumstances of the present case, I consider that the balance between holding the Claimant to his pleaded case – in the words of Lord Hamblen in Okpabi v Royal Dutch Shell plc [2021] 1 WLR 1294 at [22], applying an analytical focus to the facts alleged and asking whether on the basis that those facts are true the cause of action asserted has a real prospect of success - and the risk that by adopting an overly strict and demanding approach in that regard the Claimant may be shut out from pursuing a claim against the Second Defendant which might prove to have merit at trial comes down against the Claimant.
In this context, I consider that it is important to recognise that there is no allegation or suggestion in the Particulars of Claim that the First Defendant acted for or on behalf of the Second Defendant, or that the First Defendant’s knowledge should be imputed to the Second Defendant. On the contrary, the pleaded case is clear in its focus on the First Defendant, and the actions she is said to have taken. In particular, this is true of paragraphs 97.1 to 97.4 of the Particulars of Claim, which allege (among other things) as follows: (1) “The First Defendant hired and instructed Harris Media to devise and implement [the Campaign]” (paragraph 97.1); (2) “The First Defendant paid Harris Media to devise and implement [the Campaign]” (paragraph 97.2); (3) “The First Defendant sent Harris Media the necessary information and materials regarding the Claimant … sent Harris Media a draft article about the Claimant … sent Harris Media … a list of names of approximately 80 journalists, along with their employing media organisations and, in some cases, their job titles … sent Harris Media … a list of names of sports journalists and their X handles … corresponded with Harris Media” (paragraphs 97.3.1 to 97.3.5); and (4) “the communications particularised in paragraph 97.3 above clearly related to actual or proposed features of [the Campaign] … these communications reflect a high, consistent and active level of involvement by the First Defendant in the content and execution of those actual or proposed features … and … it is to be inferred that the First Defendant had a high, consistent and active level of involvement in all facets of [the Campaign’s] content and execution” (paragraph 97.4). Paragraph 14 of the Particulars of Claim is to the like effect (see [16] above).
As to Mr Sherborne’s third point, in his Skeleton Argument he provided the following summary of the First Defendant’s witness statement:
paragraphs 3 to 43 contain “a range of disparate allegations by the First Defendant against the Claimant, including one that the Claimant apparently conducted a smear campaign against her”;
paragraphs 45 to 110 contain “a range of admissions by First Defendant regarding her involvement with the Third Defendant and her engagement of Harris Media LLC to conduct a public campaign against the Claimant”;
paragraph 112 contains “a characterisation of that campaign by the First Defendant as a ‘quest… to deliver the truth about Mr. Marinakis to the people of Greece and elsewhere’”;
paragraph 59 contains “a statement by the First Defendant that her ‘rationale when choosing the material to send to Harris [Media LLC] was that [she] believed that there was substantial truth in the allegations that Mr Marinakis was [a] a football match fixer, [b] that he routinely and systematically breached oil sanctions imposed on Russia and Iran; and [c] that he was the arranger behind the Noor1 drugs trafficking case’”;
paragraph 60 onwards contains “various statements by the First Defendant as to what she ‘based’ her ‘rationale’ on in respect of each of those allegations. These include … references to pre-existing online articles”.
It is correct that within this narrative there is (among many other matters) evidence about rivalry between Greek football teams. However, the emphasis is on personal antagonisms. In paragraphs 4 and 5, the First Defendant states that the background to the present claim stems from the conduct of the Claimant “which I allege was criminal in nature, [and] was sustained and targeted by [the Claimant] against both me and my brother Theodoros Karipidis and breached our human rights”; and paragraph 6 refers to “a chronology of adverse incidents either involving or orchestrated by [the Claimant] against either myself, my brother, or other people in our presence”.
The evidence relating to the Greek football team rivalry begins in paragraph 17 of the First Defendant’s witness statement, where she states that “the present situation all started on 2 April 2023 after the game between Aris and Olympiacos in Karaiskakis stadium, which ended in a 2-2 draw”. In very brief summary, the First Defendant alleges that the Claimant was determined that his team, Olympiacos FC, should win that match, by fair means or foul; that the Claimant pressurised her brother to “fix” the game; that the First Defendant’s brother did not do this, and the Claimant was furious when, in the result, Aris Thessaloniki FC won; and that matters were made worse when on 26 April 2023 in another match between the same teams Aris Thessaloniki FC also won because “From that day on [the Claimant] thought that we were responsible for him losing the championship because we accomplished 2 wins and a draw – whereby he started to threaten me and my family in every possible way”. The evidence relating to the match on 2 April 2023 and its aftermath includes the following:
At the end of the game with the final score a draw at 2-2, [the Claimant] returned again to verbally assault [my brother], telling him: “You are finished,” and “I will destroy you … I will eliminate you from Greece and from football.”
Coming off the pitch my brother was approached by Vassilis Roubetis, [the Claimant’s] right hand man, and an organised criminal (now deceased) who had a role with Olympiacos’s and [the Claimant’s] team. Roubetis told him the following: ‘I have orders from Marinakis to make you disappear; you won't have a place to hide; I'll blow you up in the Porsche you have outside with the 7s (meaning the license plate number of my brother's car which is 7777) I will burn your office, you can’t fathom what we can do to you, we'll make you and your family disappear. You'll be on your knees begging for your life.’”
The only reference that the Claimant makes to the contents of the First Defendant’s witness statement in his evidence in reply is at paragraph 27 of his witness statement, in which he addresses the First Defendant’s claims (i) at paragraph 55 of her witness statement, that “by sharing publicly available information with foreign media, there would be more public scrutiny of me by the Greek public”, and (ii) at paragraph 112 of her witness statement, “that her ‘quest’ was to deliver the truth about me to the people of Greece and elsewhere”. He states (perhaps straying into argument):
“It is ridiculous to argue that the smear campaign which targeted NFFC fans (including through the deliberate use of digital vans driving around Nottingham) would have any impact on the opinion of the Greek public. It is clear that carrying out any kind of media campaign in England, would only have a significant effect on the minds of the English public, and specifically in this case, the people of Nottingham and supporters of NFFC.”
However, the First Defendant’s evidence is disputed by Mr Vrentzos, who states that he is a director of Nottingham Forest Football Club and NF Football Investments Limited, as well as being the CEO of Alter Ego Media. For example, (i) with regard to the alleged request to “fix” the match on 2 April 2023, Mr Vrentzos states “I cannot imagine Mr Marinakis ever having such a discussion with Mr Karipidis. I have witnessed their relationship firsthand for many years” and that “There is no reason that [their] relationship would not have continued normally following the match in April 2023”; and (ii) with regard to Mr Roubetis, Mr Vrentzos states:
“I know who Mr Roubetis was, but to my knowledge Mr Marinakis ever had a professional relationship with him. Had he been a “right hand man” I would have been aware of this given my close working relationship with Mr Marinakis; it is clearly untrue. Mr Roubetis was a member of supporter groups at Olympiacos, but as far as I know, the only crossover between Mr Marinakis and Mr Roubetis was that they would be in the same place at the same time by being in the stadium on match days, but their relationship did not go any further than that as far as I am aware.”
Further, in his second witness statement, Mr Scott states at paragraph 26 that “The Claimant’s position is that the assertions about him in the First Defendant’s witness statement are untrue” and states at paragraph 28, going into further detail:
“The same is true of the match fixing allegations. The series of events did not take place. It seems that there were only two people involved in this alleged conversation, one being the Claimant and the other being the First Defendant’s brother (although he gives no evidence about it himself) … Likewise, the suggestion that Vassilis Roubetis was the Claimant’s “right hand man” is also untrue. I am instructed that the Claimant has never had any form of business dealings with this individual and this has also been confirmed in evidence before this Court by a close business associate of the Claimant.”
It is perhaps a little ironic that Mr Scott takes the point that the First Defendant’s brother has not given evidence in this context when the Claimant has also not done so.
The First Defendant’s evidence in other respects is disputed by Mr Kourtakis, who states, for example, that the First Defendant’s claim that Mr Kourtakis receives instructions and orders from the Claimant is false.
In my judgment, none of these materials go any way towards fleshing out or making good a case that the Second Defendant is involved with or implicated in the Campaign against the Claimant alleged in the Particulars of Claim or the publications complained of, in some further or alternative way to the pleaded acts of making two payments. The First Defendant’s evidence, as I have said, alleges actions, differences, threats, and intimidation involving the Claimant on the one hand and her brother and her on the other hand. Those allegations are not answered by evidence from the Claimant himself, but are effectively disputed root and branch by other witnesses – the thrust of the evidence of Mr Vrentzos, for example, being that there was never any conversation out of the ordinary between the Claimant and the First Defendant’s brother, and that there was no reason for falling out, and no actual falling out, between them. The fact that the Second Defendant is the owner of a Greek football club that is a rival to the one owned by the Claimant does not by itself advance the Claimant’s case at all.
For these reasons, I decide this issue in favour of the Second Defendant. Even if all the facts alleged in the Particulars of Claim are true, the cause of action for defamation asserted against the Second Defendant has no real prospect of success. The Claimant has not persuaded me that the outcome which that conclusion points to should be tempered or reversed either (i) because the Campaign was structured in such a way that the role of the persons behind it was concealed, and the Claimant’s knowledge about how it was organised and authorised is inevitably incomplete, or (ii) because the Second Defendant might be motivated to become involved in the publication of defamatory allegations against the Claimant in this jurisdiction because it owns a Greek football club which is a rival to one owned by the Claimant. Both of these points, in different ways, involve the suggestion that the evidence that can reasonably be expected to be available at trial may be such as to enable the Claimant to improve and extend his case against the Second Defendant beyond the facts currently pleaded. However, I am not persuaded of this. As rehearsed above, the Claimant has expended an extraordinary amount of effort and money in investigating the wrongdoing complained of, although the parties have filed extensive witness statements neither side’s evidence supports that suggestion, and I consider the pleaded case must prevail.
Before leaving the contents of the witness statements, it is right to mention that the First Defendant explains at paragraph 56 of her witness statement that “I borrowed [the sum of US $30,000 that I had agreed to pay Harris Media LLC] under contract from the company I work for [the Second Defendant], and [the Second Defendant] deposited into their account on my behalf on 18 October 2023. I produce the loan contract between [the Second Defendant] and myself…”. There is no challenge to this evidence in the Claimant’s evidence in reply, and while Mr Scott states that the fact that evidence is not challenged does not mean that it is accepted by the Claimant, on the face of it, it supports the case that the Campaign was funded by the First Defendant.
In my judgment, the like points apply to the pleaded case that the Second Defendant is liable for conspiracy to injure the Claimant by unlawful means. In essence, the making of two payments to Harris Media at the behest of the First Defendant and on her behalf (as set out in paragraph 97.2 of the Particulars of Claim) is the only act of the Second Defendant that is relied on either (i) as evidencing the Second Defendant’s combination with other Defendants with the common intention of publishing the defamatory allegations complained of, or of causing them to be published (see paragraph 102 of the Particulars of Claim) or (ii) as constituting overt action taken by the Second Defendant in furtherance of the alleged conspiracy (see paragraph 103 of the Particulars of Claim). The language of paragraph 97.2 of the Particulars of Claim is not suggestive of a common design between the First Defendant and the Second Defendant (let alone between the Second Defendant and other Defendants, who are not mentioned at all in this context): for A to make payment to a third party on behalf of B pursuant to the directions and authorisation of B suggests that A received instructions and acted in compliance with them rather than a combination or agreement between A and B. The like allegations could be made with regard to a bank or other financial institution. Further, the fact that the Second Defendant acted in the manner alleged is inadequate to support any inference of conspiracy between the Second Defendant and the First Defendant, let alone between it and other Defendants.
Indeed, the authorities make clear that allegations of conspiracy to injure are grave and serious and must be pleaded to a high standard, even if they do not involve dishonesty. In the instant case, so far as concerns the Second Defendant, I do not consider that standard has been met. The allegations in paragraphs 102 and 103 of the Particulars of Claim are, by themselves, scant and of the most general nature. So far as concerns the First Defendant, clarity and particularity is supplied by the incorporation by reference of paragraphs 5 to 15 and paragraph 97 of the Particulars of Claim, which contain detailed allegations against her. So far as concerns the Second Defendant, however, no such clarity or particularity is provided, and, as set out above, the facts alleged in paragraph 97.2 of the Particulars of Claim seem to me inadequate.
The only point which weighs in favour of the Claimant under this head is that the authorities make clear that, in the interests of ensuring justice by not preventing him from pursuing a claim that he may be able to make good at trial, he should be allowed “a measure of generosity” in respect of his pleaded case. As explained above, I consider that, on the facts of this particular case, the reasons for adopting that approach are weakened, but, in any event, I do not consider that it warrants bolstering the facts alleged so as to convert them into a cause of action that has a real prospect of success; or allowing the case to go forward on the basis that it may somehow be made good.
Accordingly, the strength of the Second Defendant’s arguments against the Claimant in respect of the merits of this cause of action are, if anything, stronger than they are in respect of that for defamation. I therefore conclude that it, too, lacks sufficient merit.
A point that has caused me to pause before reaching these conclusions is that in the letter from Mr Harris that was relied upon in support of the Third and Fourth Defendants’ current application (see [98] below) reference is made to a relationship existing, to services being provided, and to a budget being set, as between, on the one hand, Harris Media and, on the other hand, not only the First Defendant but also the Second Defendant. As against that, Mr Harris made an Affidavit on 7 March 2024 pursuant to an Order made by a District Court in Texas on 4 March 2024, in which, among other things, he verified on oath the name and contact details of the “unknown client” of Harris Media referred to in the proceedings in the Texas Court. In that Affidavit, Mr Harris named the First Defendant as the “unknown client” and gave as the material email address the First Defendant’s personal email address (although he also gave the Second Defendant’s address as the “Mailing address” or the “Mailing address of the unknown client’s business” and gave the name of the Second Defendant as the “Name of unknown client’s business”). As the Affidavit was available to the Claimant when the Particulars of Claim were being prepared, and as they contain no allegation that Harris Media provided services to the Second Defendant, or acted on the instructions of the Second Defendant (whether through the medium of the First Defendant or at all), it appears to me that the Claimant’s legal advisers must have taken the Affidavit (and the 51 pages of Harris Media records which were attached to it) at face value, and I consider that I should do the same. I assume that the letter was not available to the Claimant at that time, and on one view it could provide a basis for changing the stance adopted in the Particulars of Claim. However, the extensive written and oral arguments before me contained no suggestion of that. In these circumstances, and bearing in mind that the Affidavit comprises sworn evidence, and that the apparent purpose of the letter was to make clear that the Third Defendant was not a “client” rather than to deal with the roles of the First and Second Defendants, I do not consider that the contents of the letter should cause me to alter my conclusions.
I should also mention that Mr Summers further contended on behalf of the Second Defendant (a company incorporated under the laws of Cyprus) that it should not have been sued at all, and that the Claimant should instead have sued a company of the same name that is incorporated under the laws of Greece, which, it was said, is the entity that made payment to Harris Media. This contention was met by evidence in reply from Mr Scott, supported by letters from Greek Counsel and Cypriot Counsel, to the effect that the Greek entity in question is not a separate legal entity, but merely a branch of the Second Defendant for whose actions the Second Defendant is liable.
Faced with this evidence, Mr Hodson gave up on the point, for present purposes alone.
The Third and Fourth Defendants
The submissions of Mr Sinai on behalf of the Third and Fourth Defendants were to similar effect to those of Mr Hodson on behalf of the First and Second Defendants.
In particular, Mr Sinai submitted:
The acts and knowledge of the Third Defendant alleged in paragraphs 97.5 and 97.6.1 to 97.6.3 inclusive of the Particulars of Claim form the basis of the pleaded case (i) that the Third Defendant was actively and knowingly involved in publishing the statements complained of (see paragraph 97.6.4 of the Particulars of Claim); (ii) that the Fourth Defendant was actively and knowingly involved in publishing the statements complained of (see paragraph 97.7 of the Particulars of Claim); (iii) that the Third and Fourth Defendants conspired and combined together and/or with one or more of the other Defendants to injure the Claimant by publishing the allegations complained of or causing them to be published (see paragraph 102 of the Particulars of Claim); and (iv) that all the Defendants published those allegations or caused them to be published pursuant to and in furtherance of that conspiracy (see paragraph 103 of the Particulars of Claim).
The allegations in paragraphs 97.5.1, 97.5.2, 97.5.3, 97.5.7, 97.5.8 and 97.6.1 of the Particulars of Claim do not in and of themselves take the claim anywhere. Even if the Third and/or Fourth Defendants (a) had a pre-existing relationship with the First Defendant, (b) referred the First Defendant to Harris Media, (c) earned a referral fee, (d) generally referred new clients to Harris Media, (e) had a pre-existing relationship with Mr Harris, or (f) had a comprehensive understanding of the services provided by Harris Media, none of those facts and matters constitutes participating in, securing, or authorising the publications complained of in such a way as to be liable in accordance with the law of defamation. Further, the facts and matters alleged do not give rise to accessory liability on the part of the Third and/or Fourth Defendants because it is not enough to show that they, or either of them, did acts which facilitated the commission of the tort of defamation by others. Still further, these facts and matters do not involve conduct which is only consistent with participation in either the libels of the conspiracy complained of.
Accordingly, the Claimant’s ability to satisfy the Court that he has a real prospect of success at trial on both the claim for defamation and the claim for conspiracy depend upon the pleas contained in paragraphs 97.5.4, 97.5.5 and 97.5.6.
Paragraph 97.5.4 of the Particulars of Claim pleads that the Third Defendant acted as a conduit for the payment of the second instalment by the Second Defendant of the fees charged by Harris Media for devising and implementing the Campaign “by directing and/or authorising the Fourth Defendant to act as a conduit for that payment”. The contemporary documents record a payment from the Second Defendant to the Fourth Defendant of US $29,949 on 6 December 2023, and a payment of US $25,000 from the Fourth Defendant to Harris Media on 14 December 2023. The Third Defendant’s evidence (paragraph 11 of his witness statement) is that: “This fee [i.e. of US $5,000] was due from Harris Media and so it was administratively convenient for the instalment to be paid via the Fourth Defendant (so that it could deduct that fee)”. Mr Sinai submitted: “The payment itself was lawful and made for services rendered. Deducting a commercial fee for a professional introduction does not amount to acting as a conduit or active involvement in publishing the defamatory statements or a concert to injure. Neither does [making] a lawful deduction constitute an intention to cause loss …”.
Paragraph 97.5.5 of the Particulars of Claim alleges that the Third Defendant was copied into a significant amount of email correspondence between the First Defendant and Harris Media relating to the content and execution of the Campaign over December 2023. Mr Sinai submitted: (i) The email correspondence, which the Claimant had obtained from Harris Media pursuant to a Court Order made in Texas, is not exhibited to the Particulars of Claim and was not placed before Senior Master Cook. (ii) It is exhibited to the Third Defendant’s witness statement (see pages 1107 to 1159 of the hearing bundle), and the emails which were copied to him are at pages 1110, 1113, 1123, 1124, 1126, 1127, 1130, 1150, 1158 and 1159 of the hearing bundle. (iii) Apart from two emails (see pages 1158-1159), none of the emails are addressed to the Third Defendant or evidence or require any involvement by him. (iv) Instead, the emails comprise instructions and information passing between the First Defendant and Harris Media and “There is no engagement, input, response, reaction or anything similar from [the Third Defendant]… the emails show nothing more than [him] being copied on exchanges between the First Defendant and Harris Media. They do not evidence involvement … and do not show that [he] introduced the First Defendant to Harris Media with the intention of starting a defamatory smear campaign”.
The Third Defendant’s evidence about these emails (see paragraph 12 of his witness statement) is as follows:
“It can be seen from the attachments that I was copied into some of the email correspondence, but not all of it. I do not know why I was/was not copied into any particular email, but my experience as an introducer is that the parties I introduce will often include me in group emails going forward. I believe that this may initially be done as some sort of courtesy (or perhaps to ensure that each side is aware that I can see how the other is behaving given that I introduced them) but sometimes this continues long after the introduction.”
Paragraph 97.5.6 of the Particulars of Claim alleges that the Third Defendant passed on instructions from the First Defendant to Harris Media. Mr Sinai submitted that, in fact (i) there was only one material email, (ii) that email undermines the Claimant’s case on intention and involvement, because it shows that the Third Defendant was merely passing on the First Defendant’s “preference” and did not make any decisions, and (iii) in any event, the “instruction” that was passed on was not to use an aircraft banner and thus does not relate to any of the publications complained of.
The text of the material email (from the Third Defendant to Harris Media dated 12 December 2023) reads as follows:
“Hi Brian
Irini prefers that we stick to the current budget and at this point only do the plan banner fly over.
Thanks
Ari”
Mr Sinai submitted that, accordingly, (i) the primary facts pleaded in the Particulars of Claim do not disclose a case that has any real prospect of success against either the Third Defendant or the Fourth Defendant, (ii) in fact, no real attempt is made to formulate a case of corporate liability against the Fourth Defendant, (iii) indeed, it is  pleaded that the publications comprising the Campaign were the work of Harris Media without any express involvement or instruction from the Third or Fourth Defendants.
Mr Sinai further relied on the following letter from Mr Harris produced by the Third Defendant (spellings reproduced below as in the original):
“I confirm that your role in the relationship between Harris Media LLC and [A]mani Swiss (Cyprus) Limited was simply to have introduced Irina Karipidis to me and my company and no more.
To my knowledge you were not party to decisions or services provided by Harris Media LLC to Irina Karpidis and Amani Swiss (Cyprus) Limited nor did you in any way direct provision of and requirement for those services on behalf of Irina Karpidis and Amani Swiss (Cyprus) Limited.
I also confirm that I am aware of one email received from you in which you request that Harris Media LLC keep within the budget requested by Irina Karpidis and Amani Swiss (Cyprus) Limited. This request was clearly made and understood to be on behalf of Irina Karpidis and Amani Swiss (Cyprus) Limited.”
Mr Sherborne submitted:
The Third Defendant admits (at paragraphs 8 to 11 and 14 to 15 of his witness statement) the facts pleaded in paragraphs 97.5.1 to 97.5.4, and 97.5.7, of the Particulars of Claim, and (in substance) in 97.5.8 of the Particulars of Claim.
As to paragraph 97.5.5 of the Particulars of Claim, the Third Defendant admits to being copied into email correspondence. In fact, his evidence about these emails is contained in paragraph 12 of his witness statement (see [92] above).
As to paragraph 97.5.6 of the Particulars of Claim, the Third Defendant admits to passing instructions from the First Defendant to Harris Media LLC in the form of an email of 12 December 2023. In fact, his evidence about this email (see paragraph 13 of his witness statement) is as follows:
“I believe that the reason I sent that email was because I was with the First Defendant when the email from Harris Media arrived and she told me that she wanted to stick to the budget that she had agreed and asked me if I would say so. I do not believe that I passed on any instructions on any other occasion. I had no reason to involve myself in what the Claimant calls the Smear Campaign. My only financial incentive was as introducer, and I bore the Claimant no ill-will. If I had been expected to remain involved professionally and not just as an introducer, I would have sought a significant ongoing financial remuneration and would have produced a formal contract setting out my responsibilities and rewards and shared documented plans for executing my responsibilities.”
It should be noted that the email in question states “Irini prefers that we stick to the current budget”, which is consistent with the Third Defendant (and not merely the First Defendant alone) playing a part in orchestrating the Campaign.
Insofar as the Third and Fourth Defendants appear to attack the merits of the Claimant’s claim, this amounts merely to a denial of their personal involvement in the Campaign, and a challenge to the conclusions which the Claimant is inviting the Court to draw at paragraphs 97.6 and 97.7 of the Particulars of Claim.
Contentions of this kind cannot assist the Third and Fourth Defendants, as they give rise to matters for trial, which cannot be resolved on the present application.
Accordingly, Mr Sherborne submitted that the Claimant clearly has at the very least a real prospect of success in his claim as against the Third and Fourth Defendants.
I agree with Mr Sinai that the allegations in paragraphs 97.5.1, 97.5.2, 97.5.3, 97.5.7, 97.5.8 and 97.6.1 of the Particulars of Claim do not in and of themselves amount to a cause of action. However, I do not consider that they are pleaded on this basis. Instead, they are put forward as relevant to support the inference that, speaking broadly, when the Third Defendant put the First Defendant in touch with Harris Media he did so in the knowledge that the First Defendant needed assistance in publishing allegations like those which comprised the Campaign, that he chose Harris Media as the right people to help her with this, and that he thus actively participated in such publication.
As to paragraph 97.5.4 of the Particulars of Claim, I also agree with Mr Sinai that neither acting as a conduit for payment nor deducting a fee for effecting an introduction in and of themselves amount to a cause of action. Again, however, I do not consider that the allegations concerning participation in the payment of Harris Media are pleaded on this basis. Instead, they are put forward as demonstrating the involvement of the Third Defendant (because he organised these matters) and the Fourth Defendant (because it received the monies, and, as it happens, retained the fee) in the engagement of Harris Media, and that engagement (in the knowledge of what the First Defendant wanted help to do) is said to comprise participation in publication.
In any event, I consider that the Third and Fourth Defendants’ arguments run into difficulty at paragraphs 97.5.5 and 97.5.6 of the Particulars of Claim. By the time that these emails were copied to him, or in one instance sent by him, it is at the very least clearly arguable that the Third Defendant knew the contents of the Campaign or at least the substance of the publications that constituted the Campaign. The fact that, on the material at present available, the Third Defendant passed no comment, still less expressed any misgivings or suggested any element of restraint, is capable of supporting the inference that what was happening came as no surprise to him, and that he knew the nature of what was planned by the First Defendant before and at the time that he introduced her to Harris Media. Indeed, he does not deny this:
In paragraph 6 of his witness statement, the Third Defendant states:
“I had no reason to take part in any action against him (or to have the Fourth Defendant do so) and I wish to be clear that I took no part in the campaign of which he complains in this claim.”
However, whether or not the Third Defendant “took no part in the campaign” depends on what he did, and the knowledge with which he did it.
The Third Defendant deals with the circumstances of his introduction of the First Claimant to Harris Media at paragraph 9 of his witness statement:
“I knew when I made the introduction that the First Defendant wished to retain Harris Media in order to engage in a public campaign against the Claimant (because the First Defendant made no secret of her dislike for him), but whether Harris Media would accept any retainer and if so how that retainer would be conducted were matters which were completely at the discretion of Harris Media.”
This evidence does not grapple with the precise extent of the Third Defendant’s knowledge concerning the proposed Campaign. However, it contains no denial that the Third Defendant knew the details of what was planned. As he knew that the First Defendant disliked the Claimant and was planning a public campaign against him, the Third Defendant apparently knew that her intentions were hostile. The prospect that the Claimant may establish at trial that the Third Defendant knew in detail what the First Defendant intended is plainly real on this evidence alone.
The Third Defendant’s explanation as to why he was copied in on emails between Harris Media and the First Defendant is expressed in defensive and general terms. In any event, there is a real prospect that it may be shown to be inaccurate or incomplete.
The use of the word “we” in the email passing on the First Defendant’s “preference” is also, on the face of it, a legitimate point to be explored at trial.
In addition, there is, it seems to me, a real prospect that further documents exist which may be relevant to the roles played by the First Defendant and the Third Defendant respectively, and the precise nature of their relationship to one another. For example, it is not unlikely that there are in existence material emails passing between the Third Defendant and the First Defendant. In particular, it is impossible to reach a conclusive view as to the implications of the emails that the Claimant obtained from Harris Media out of context, which may include the contents of other emails.
It seems to me that the facts upon which the Claimant’s case against the Third and Fourth Defendants depend are not dissimilar to the facts of Dar Al Arkan Real Estate Development Com. v Al Refai & Ors [2013] EWHC 1630 (Comm). In that case, a company (“FTI”) which provided public relations services and which was alleged by the Claimants to have been engaged as part of a campaign by a former employee of the Claimants to discredit them failed to obtain summary judgment or to have the case struck out against it. FTI accepted that one of its directors had participated in discussions about the possibility that the internet might be used “to get out into the public domain [the employee’s] side of the story” and was told that the employee had “information in his possession that was adverse to the Claimants”, but the director denied being provided with the information itself. FTI argued, among other things, that it was not responsible for the publications complained of on a Website because it had made clear that it would not be involved with developing the Website at a time when the words of which Claimants complained had yet to crystallise, and the Website contained “radically different” allegations to those contemplated when FTI was involved. Andrew Smith J said at [34] that he was “not persuaded that it is fatal to the claimants that they do not allege … that FTI knew of the precise words complained of before they were published” and cited the following words from the judgment of Lord Denman CJ in R v Cooper (1846) 8 QB 533, at 535-536: “If a man request another generally to write a libel, he must be answerable for any libel written in pursuance of his request: he contributes to a misdemeanour and is therefore responsible as a principal. He takes his chance on what is to be published …”.
Nor am I persuaded that the pleaded case against the Fourth Defendant is insufficient. The Fourth Defendant is in the business of providing services of the kind which were provided to the First Defendant in the present case; the fee that was charged for those services was paid to the Fourth Defendant; and, although this is not expressly pleaded in the Particulars of Claim, the natural inference is that the Third Defendant acted for and on behalf of the Fourth Defendant. Moreover, the Third Defendant does not suggest in his evidence that he acted in his personal capacity.
In my opinion, the position of the Fourth Defendant, and its relationship to the Third Defendant, is very different from the position of the Second Defendant, and its relationship to the First Defendant. None of the above points apply to the latter.
The above analysis is primarily concerned with the case of joint and several liability for the tort of defamation. However, in the present case, as was true in the Dar Al Arkan case, there is a substantial overlap between the facts relied on in support of that cause of action and the facts relied on in support of the claims for unlawful means conspiracy. Indeed, Counsel for both sides addressed both claims together.
In this regard, the clarity and particularity of the pleaded claim for conspiracy as against the Third and Fourth Defendants is made good by the repetition of the facts and matters relied upon in support of the pleaded case of defamation against them. Those allegations, if right, are capable of supporting not only (i) a claim that the Third and Fourth Defendants are liable as primary tortfeasors or as accessories to the First Defendant’s commission of the tort of defamation but also (ii) a claim that they are liable as participants in a combination or agreement between them and the First Defendant pursuant to which unlawful action was taken which caused loss or damage to the Claimant and was intended or expected by them to do so (even if that was not the predominant purpose of the Third and Fourth Defendants or either of them).
For all these reasons, I conclude that both the Claimant’s pleaded causes of action as against the Third and Fourth Defendants have at least a real prospect of success.
Section 10 of the Defamation Act 2013
In reaching the above conclusions, I have not overlooked the fact that both Mr Hodson and Mr Sinai argued that the court has no jurisdiction to hear the claim against the Defendants in light of the provisions of section 10 of the Defamation Act 2013:
A court does not have jurisdiction to hear and determine an action for defamation brought against a person who was not the author, editor or publisher of the statement complained of unless the court is satisfied that it is not reasonably practicable for an action to be brought against the author, editor or publisher.
In this section “author”, “editor” and “publisher” have the same meaning as in section 1 of the Defamation Act 1996.”
In this regard, (among other things) section 1(2) of the Defamation Act 1996 (i) defines “author” as “the originator of the statement, but does not include a person who did not intend that his statement be published at all”, and (ii) defines “publisher” as “a commercial publisher, that is, a person whose business is issuing material to the public, or a section of the public, who issues material containing the statement in the course of that business”. It also defines “editor” as “a person having editorial or equivalent responsibility for the content of the statement or the decision to publish it”.
Section 10 of the Defamation Act 2013 is considered by the authors of Gatley at para 7-045 under the rubric “jurisdictional bar on claims against secondary publisher”. In keeping with the discussion contained in that paragraph, Mr Sherborne submitted that, in essence, this provision is concerned with protecting innocent disseminators.
In my judgment, there is nothing in this point.
First, there was plainly an “author” of each of the statements complained of in the Particulars of Claim within the meaning of section 1 of the Defamation Act 1996. On the material presently before the Court, the live possibilities would appear to be (i) that the “author” was the First Defendant alone, or (ii) that the “author” was the First Defendant together with one or other or both of the Third and Fourth Defendants, but (iii) that even in the event that (i) applies, the Third and/or Fourth Defendants are nevertheless at least arguably liable in accordance with the principle of accessory liability. If either (i) or (ii) applies, the Court plainly has jurisdiction to hear and determine the claim for defamation, either as against the First Defendant alone or as against her and one or other or both of the Third and Fourth Defendants. So far as scenario (iii) is concerned, I do not consider that section 10 of the Defamation Act 2013 was intended to exclude or cut down the jurisdiction of the Court to entertain claims against those jointly liable with the “author” of published statements for the tort of defamation. No authority was cited to me in support of the contrary proposition.
The same reasoning applies if the correct label to be applied to any or all of the First, Third and Fourth Defendants is, in truth, that of “editor” rather than “author”.
Second, turning to the definition of “publisher” contained in section 1 of the Defamation Act 1996, it was submitted on behalf of the Defendants (i) that Harris Media was the “commercial publisher” of the statements complained of in the Particulars of Claim and (ii) that the Claimant has not explained why it is not reasonably practicable for him to bring an action against Harris Media.
As to the first of those points, if Harris Media was a “commercial publisher”, there would appear to be no reason why (on the basis that the facts alleged in the Particulars of Claim are to be taken as true) the Fourth Defendant was not also a “commercial publisher”; and no reason why the Third Defendant should not be caught by section 1(4) of the Defamation Act 1996: “Employees or agents of an author, editor or publisher are in the same position as their employer or principal to the extent that they are responsible for the content of the statement or the decision to publish it”.
As to the second of those points, this is discussed by the authors of Gatley at para 7-045, where they give the example of a claim against a publisher in the USA which would be unenforceable in that jurisdiction in accordance with the principles of freedom of expression in that jurisdiction, and express the view that “It cannot be required of a claimant that he pursue a claim that even if successful would be of no practical value to him …”. It appears from that discussion that the point is undecided, and indeed no authority was cited to me as to the ambit of the expression “not reasonably practicable” either in this specific context or at all. The arguments based on section 10 of the Defamation Act 2013 were not flagged up to the Claimant in advance of the exchange of Skeleton Arguments for the hearing, were not developed in any detail at the hearing, do not require to be resolved in this regard in light of my conclusions relating to the definition of “author” and/or because if Harris Media is a “commercial publisher” it would seem that the Third and Fourth Defendants can be sued on the like footing; and even if those arguments were right they would leave the Claimant able to pursue a cause of action for unlawful means conspiracy which would cover all the same terrain as the defamation claim (because the alleged unlawful means consists of libelling the Claimant). In these circumstances, I consider it better to leave the second point to be decided on some occasion where it needs to be decided.
That said, I can see force in the views expressed by the authors of Gatley, bearing in mind, in particular, that it is now well-settled that the courts should adopt a purposive approach to statutory interpretation where possible (see, for example, Rittson-Thomas v Oxfordshire County Council [2022] AC 129, Lady Arden JSC and Lord Burrows JSC speaking for the Supreme Court at [33]).
THE FORUM TEST
Mr Hodson submitted that the Claimant had not discharged the burden of showing that England and Wales is clearly the most appropriate place in which to bring his claims in respect of the publications complained of, or the proper place in which to bring his claims for unlawful means conspiracy, for the following principal reasons: (i) no part of the alleged common design is pleaded as having taken place, or in fact took place, within this jurisdiction; (ii) it is clear from the existence of proceedings in Greece that “all parties consider Greece to be an appropriate forum for the airing of defamation proceedings”, and, further, the Claimant’s evidence nowhere explains why “the Greek courts would be unsuitable, or an unfair forum, to hear the case”.
Mr Sinai did not contend that England and Wales is not the appropriate place for the determination of the Claimant’s claims against the Third and Fourth Defendants.
Mr Sherborne’s principal submissions in response to Mr Hodson’s arguments were to the following effect: (i) the statements complained of were published in this jurisdiction, and caused damage to the Claimant’s reputation in this jurisdiction; (ii) accordingly, this is the jurisdiction with which both the action for defamation and the action for unlawful means conspiracy (as the “unlawful means” comprise the same defamatory publications) have the most real and substantial connection; (iii) there is no other suitable forum, let alone any forum which is more suitable, because (among other things) none of the Defendants are domiciled in any single foreign jurisdiction, and the claim is centrally concerned with a Campaign of publications which were published in England to an English audience and in the English language (and to which the law of England and Wales applies); and (iv) even if the place of commission of the unlawful means conspiracy could be said to be some foreign jurisdiction (and it should be noted that Mr Hodson did not identify what jurisdiction that would be), that is only one factor which is relevant when deciding whether that jurisdiction is clearly or distinctly the appropriate place in which to bring the present claim, and in the instant case that factor is outweighed by other factors, such as those identified in (i)-(iii) above. In particular, it is impossible to say that the bulk of the evidence will come from witnesses in any one foreign jurisdiction as (a) it is unclear whether and on what basis the allegations complained of will, in fact, be defended, (b) even if they are defended, for example as being substantially true, they concern not only match-fixing in Greece and drug trafficking into Greece but also sanctions breaking involving shipments from Russia and complaints emanating from the USA, (c) further, evidence relevant to other possible defences, such as public interest, would or may involve witnesses from Israel and the USA, and (d) how many witnesses may be required from each jurisdiction is unknown (see VTB Capital plc v Nutriek International Corp [2013] UKSC 5; [2013] 2 AC 337, Lord Mance JSC at [51] “The significance attaching to the place of commission may be dwarfed by other countervailing factors.”).
In my judgment, Mr Sherborne’s submissions are plainly to be preferred.
FULL AND FRANK DISCLOSURE
The First and Second Defendants’ case that Mr Scott’s evidence before Senior Master Cook failed to comply with the Claimant’s duty of full and frank disclosure is summarised in Mr Summers’ first witness statement as comprising a failure (i) “to bring adverse documents on the material chapters of the case … to the attention of the court” and (ii) to appraise the Court “of the history of intimidation by the Claimant’s family and cohorts in Greece before and since the claim was filed in court”.
Mr Summers explains, in summary:
With regard to allegations of match fixing, (i) media companies controlled by the Claimant are Defendants in a libel action in Greece brought by the First Defendant and her brother in September 2023 in connection with a sustained public relations campaign orchestrated by the Claimant, this action involves match fixing claims against the Claimant, and Senior Master Cook was entitled to know the detail of these proceedings so that he could consider the issue of overlapping proceedings in Greece dealing with similar issues of fact; (ii) as these Greek libel proceedings had been commenced first, it was at least arguable that bringing the present libel claim in this jurisdiction amounted to an abuse of process, alternatively that Greece was the appropriate place in which to determine the allegations of match fixing against the Claimant; and (iii) in any event, it was not disclosed that there are in the public domain in this jurisdiction many allegations of match fixing against the Claimant, which was “relevant to merits, and in particular to ‘serious harm’”.
With regard to allegations of drug trafficking, (i) the Claimant is a suspect in a live drug trafficking investigation in Greece and has faced preliminary charges, and although the lead investigator concluded that there was no evidence implicating the Claimant, the Piraeus Appeals Prosecutor disagreed and has returned the case for further investigation which is still ongoing; (ii) there is an ongoing criminal libel action in Greece brought by the Claimant against a journalist called Alexander Clapp relating to an article of September 2020 in which Mr Clapp accused the Claimant of trafficking drugs; (iii) Senior Master Cook was not informed of these two sets of Greek criminal proceedings, as he ought to have been; (iii) as these Greek proceedings had been commenced first, it was at least arguable that bringing the present libel claim in this jurisdiction before they had reached their conclusion amounted to an abuse of process, alternatively that Greece was the appropriate place in which to determine the allegations of drug trafficking against the Claimant;  and (iv) it is at least arguable that “there is no prospect of surpassing the ‘serious harm’ threshold”.
With regard to sanctions breaking, (i) in 2021, a vessel owned by the Claimant’s company, Capital Ship Management Corporation, was stopped and found to contain sanctioned Iranian oil resulting in the seizure of the vessel under US forfeiture laws; (ii) the Claimant admitted to the First Defendant that he was involved in “knowingly transiting Iranian sanctioned oil”; (iii) the First Defendant has compiled a schedule of 9 voyages involving vessels owned and controlled by one of the Claimant’s companies entering Russian ports, which she “contends involved clear breaches of US/EU/UK sanctions and associated criminal offences”; (iv) there are in the public domain within this jurisdiction a number of articles containing allegations concerning the Claimant’s alleged shipping of Iranian and Russian oil, which “would have been relevant to merits, and in particular to ‘serious harm’”;  and (v) had Senior Master Cook “known all this [he] would not have allowed the Claimant to proceed with his claim where the Claimant through his companies was persistently in breach of sanction laws”, as it was “either a clear abuse of process or doomed to fail in the face of a defence of truth”.
As indicated in Mr Summers’ witness statement, these points were fleshed out in the First Defendant’s witness statement. For example, with regard to the Greek libel proceedings brought by the First Defendant and her brother, she states that “in September 2023 we filed a lawsuit against [the Claimant’s] close associate and friend, Mr Kourtakis, and their media entities, for the false publications against us, because [the Claimant] continued his war against us with continuous articles when all the previous years he had only positive comments about our team and us”.
These points are answered in Mr Scott’s second witness statement:
With regard to the history of intimidation, “I am instructed that the Claimant has no knowledge of these matters whatsoever, and therefore he cannot possibly have been expected to advance evidence on them”.
With regard to allegations of match fixing, Mr Scott makes the following points (among others): (i) there is no conceivable abuse as the Claimant is not a defendant or any party to the Greek libel proceedings and the allegations that they seek to resolve do not in truth overlap with the proceedings in this jurisdiction; (ii) it is simply incorrect that the Greek libel proceedings also involve “issues of prior match fixing claims against the Claimant”; (iii) although, for these reasons, it was not material to bring the Greek libel proceedings to the attention of Senior Master Cook, they were in fact exhibited to Mr Scott’s first witness statement before him; (iv) with regard to the alleged lack of full and frank disclosure about what is in the public domain, not only was public domain material exhibited to Mr Scott’s first witness statement but also the Claimant had previously been acquitted of these allegations.
With regard to allegations of drug trafficking, Mr Scott makes the following points (among others): (i) the “preliminary charges” referred to by Mr Summers are “a complete misstatement of the nature and effect of the Greek system”; (ii) it is misleading to suggest that the Claimant has been charged or that his role in this investigation is “live”, when in truth “he was merely named in a preliminary investigation, which yielded no evidence against him in the first instance”; (iii) the Claimant has not been charged, arrested or brought to stand trial for these allegations, and “nothing has happened in relation to this “ongoing” investigation as concerns the Claimant, since March 2018”; (iv) there is simply no evidence to substantiate the pleaded meaning regarding drug trafficking and accordingly no basis for any reference to this to have been made at the permission stage; (v) as to the claim against Mr Clapp, this has since settled, “there are no longer proceedings in place”, “judgment was entered in favour of the Claimant”, and “Mr Clapp has withdrawn his allegations against the Claimant”.
With regard to allegations of sanctions breaking, Mr Scott makes the following points (among others): (i) although Iranian origin oil was loaded in Fujairah, UAE, by a ship-to-ship transfer onto a ship owned by his company, the Claimant had no involvement in this, and in fact his company was deceived by the charterers of the vessel; (ii) accordingly, the allegations that Mr Summers asserts should have been brought to the attention of Senior Master Cook are baseless; (iii) the allegations against the Claimant that are in the public domain are the product of attempts to smear his name, and, in fact a Google search of “Marinakis oil sanctions” reveals a Forbes article published on 12 July 2024 which states “there is no evidence that any of these [Greek] billionaires violated sanctions”; (iv) moreover, the allegations made in the Campaign do not relate to Russian ports and Russian oil; (v) in any event, the Claimant’s business has at all times been fully approved by the European Union; and (vi) “By exhibiting the correspondence, the press coverage in the exhibit CHS1 and the detailed references to the allegations in both those and my First Witness Statement … full, frank and proper disclosure was given of all material matters for the purposes of seeking permission”.
This evidence, in turn, was met by further evidence to the effect that Mr Scott’s account of the status and outcome of the Greek libel claim involving Mr Clapp was disputed by Mr Clapp.
In light of the guidance provided by Males LJ in Mex Group Worldwide, it would have been open to me to decline to consider the long list of alleged failures of disclosure advanced by Mr Summers and fleshed out by the First Defendant. Because of the seriousness of the allegations, however, I have thought it right to set them out, together with the Claimant’s principal answers. Having carried out that exercise, I have reached the clear conclusion that none of them are made out.
In a number of instances, the contentions are clearly without substance. For example, the suggestion that the existence of allegations in the public domain against the Claimant is relevant to the issue of “serious harm” or to the merits more generally is manifestly without foundation. The mere fact that others have made allegations, which are not claimed to have been substantiated, cannot affect whether the Claimant has a cause of action in relation to further allegations made by the First Defendant (even if they are to identical effect). Further, the existence of the alleged public domain material does not undermine the Claimant’s ability to satisfy the threshold requirement of “serious harm” (see [59] above).
In other instances, the alleged failures of disclosure depend on proof of facts which are in issue and which are plainly incapable of being resolved on the current applications, and in many instances facts which relate to the Claimant’s causes of actions. This applies, for example, to whether the Claimant has ever truthfully been implicated in drug trafficking (which includes the status and outcome of the Greek libel proceedings involving Mr Clapp) or in sanctions breaking.
In still further instances, the alleged failures raise a mixture of issues, all of which seem to me to favour the Claimant’s contentions over those of the First and Second Defendants. This applies, for example, to the allegations concerning the Greek libel proceedings brought by the First Defendant and her brother. First, approaching the matter on the basis of what appears to be common ground, it is clear that these proceedings do not involve the same parties as the current proceedings in this jurisdiction, and the parties that are being sued in Greece are not, on proper analysis, “related” to the Claimant. On these grounds alone, these two sets of proceedings do not appear to “overlap” in such a way that they were material to be disclosed on the Claimant’s application before Senior Master Cook. Second, not only does it seem implausible that an action for libel brought by the First Defendant and her brother even as against the Claimant would give rise to a need to consider whether the Claimant was involved in match fixing, but also there is a dispute on the evidence about whether   the Greek libel action does in fact raise any such allegation against the Claimant, and none of the parties suggested that this was a dispute that I could or should resolve.
Even if Greek libel proceedings had been brought by the First Defendant and her brother against the Claimant and (for some reason) the determination of those claims for libel against the Claimant involved determining the same allegations of match fixing as are made against the Claimant in the publications complained of in the present proceedings, it would not follow that the claims relating to allegations of match fixing that form the subject of the present proceedings (in relation to publications within this jurisdiction) could or should be brought in Greece. The like points apply to claims in Greece relating to drugs trafficking or sanctions breaking. It is not as if the Claimant can be said to be bringing overlapping claims in Greece. Nor is it clear how the Claimant could be made a party to the libel proceedings of the First Defendant and her brother, let alone how the Defendants or any of them could be made parties to the Claimant’s claim against Mr Clapp, or how the parties in this jurisdiction could participate in any criminal investigation in Greece. In fact, there are differences between the statements complained of in the present proceedings and the allegations which have arisen in Greece, so the premise of all this is inapplicable in any event.
It is untenable to suggest that the material relied on in the witness statements of Mr Summers and the First Defendant is sufficient to establish against the Claimant wrongdoing of such a high order of seriousness, so as to make the present claim an abuse of process or doomed to fail by reason of an unanswerable defence of truth. In fairness to Mr Hodson, the way he argued the case before me was different. It was to the effect that as the Claimant had been put on notice that the truth of the allegations made in the publications complained of in the Particulars of Claim would be in issue in the present proceedings, it was necessary to provide full and frank disclosure of the various proceedings in Greece (for example, the libel claim against Mr Clapp). However, leaving aside altogether (i) that the status, contents and implications of those proceedings have been put in issue by Mr Scott, and (ii) Mr Scott’s evidence that sufficient disclosure was given of these matters, it seems to me that even a very full exposition of these proceedings would go no further than to suggest that a defence of truth is arguable, which by itself takes matters nowhere in light of the Merits Test.
I consider that these allegations should not have been made, and certainly, once the extent of dispute became clear, pursued, in the unfiltered way in which they were.
The Third and Fourth Defendants
Mr Sinai adopted a different approach, and focused his submissions on (i) the failure to place before Senior Master Cook the documents obtained from Harris Media as a result of the proceedings in Texas and (ii) the contents of Mr Scott’s first witness statement, in support of a contention that the merits of the case had been “inflated”.
Mr Sinai listed twelve points in support of his argument that there were serious deficiencies in the presentation that was made to Senior Master Cook. I do not consider that some of them are of any moment (for example, the complaint that Mr Scott failed to point out that the Third and Fourth Defendants had offered to be cooperative). The main criticisms that were made of Mr Scott’s evidence may be summarised as follows:
In paragraph 14 of his first witness statement, Mr Scott states:
“The Defendants, all of whom were actively involved and participated in the implementation and pursuit of the Smear Campaign, are as follows …”
The complaint is made that this does not differentiate between the Defendants.
In paragraphs 16 and 17, Mr Scott explains how Norwich Pharmacal applications made by the Claimant led to the identification of Harris Media as the entity behind the publications. Then, in paragraph 18, Mr Scott refers to the disclosure order that the Claimant went on to obtain against Harris Media in Texas, and states:
“Through this order … the Claimant identified the First and Third Defendants as the individuals who provided instructions to Harris Media LLC to operate the Campaign, together with the Second and Fourth Defendants paying invoices issued by Harris Media LLC”.
The complaint is made that this exaggerates the documented case against the Third and Fourth Defendants. In this regard, none of the documents obtained by the Claimant as a result of the proceedings in Texas were placed before Senior Master Cook. Further, it was apparent from those documents that (a) in his sworn Affidavit, Mr Harris had identified the First Defendant as the “unknown client” of Harris Media (see [87] above), and (b) there was only one documented “instruction” provided by the Third Defendant, which consisted of passing on a decision of the First Defendant not to approve publication by aircraft banner (see [96] above). Similarly, the reference to the Second and Fourth Defendants paying invoices suggests a pattern of payments made on behalf of these Defendants, whereas the pleaded case against both the Second Defendant (see [23] above) and the Fourth Defendant (see [24] above) is both different and narrower than that.
In paragraph 26, Mr Scott states:
“The First and Third Defendants provided instruction to Harris Media LLC to carry out the campaign. The Second and Fourth Defendants made (or alternatively, on the Fourth Defendant’s own solicitors’ case, facilitated) payments to Harris Media LLC. The conspiracy was orchestrated by all the Defendants, who each played a specific role in its operation. Together, the Defendants have all played an active role in the unlawful means conspiracy, as well as the defamatory publications, and are therefore liable in this jurisdiction”.
The like complaints are made as apply to paragraph 18 of the witness statement.
In paragraphs 44 and 45, Mr Scott states:
“As to the Third and Fourth Defendants, Keystone Law … suggest that their clients are not responsible for the Smear Campaign. As outlined above, this is entirely contradicted by the evidence which the Claimant has obtained.
They may seek to argue in relation to the defamation complaint that they are not publishers for the purposes of s1 Defamation Act 1996. The Claimant’s position is that having been bound up in instigating the conspiracy and instructing and paying for its deployment, and [in] the knowledge of the subject matter to be deployed, the Third and Fourth Defendants would be unable to satisfy the requirements of s1(c) of the 1996 Act and assert they are not publishers”.
It is complained that it is inaccurate to claim that any suggestion that the Third and Fourth Defendants lack responsibility is “entirely contradicted” by the evidence. The repetition of the assertions that the Third and Fourth Defendants were “bound up” in “instigating the conspiracy” and “instructing and paying for its deployment” reinforces the suggestion that these allegations are not open to dispute.
In paragraph 54, Mr Scott states:
“For the purposes of full and frank disclosure, I am mindful of the need to identify what defences might be raised by the Defendants. Given the lack of any positive assertion in correspondence, the Claimant has no basis for believing the Defendants will advance defences to the unlawful means conspiracy claim”.
It is complained that this, again, overstates the strength of the case against the Defendants, and indeed suggests that the conspiracy claim will not be defended.
In paragraph 55, Mr Scott states:
“In relation to the Third and Fourth Defendants, they have also not advanced substantive defences … They may seek to argue that they did not agree with others to be part of a conspiracy and/or did not intend to injure the Claimant. The Fourth Defendant at the direction of the Third Defendant did, however, direct funds to pay for the campaign, while the Third Defendant was instructed by the First Defendant and made at least the introduction to Harris Media LLC and was aware of the defamatory allegations to be made against the Claimant. On this basis the Claimant believes his claims against both the Third and Fourth Defendants in unlawful means conspiracy will succeed”.
On one view, this paragraph in the witness statement describes the case against the Third and Fourth Defendants in more qualified terms than some of the earlier paragraphs quoted above. On the other hand, it suggests that (i) the Fourth Defendant itself provided funding for the campaign, (ii) the Third Defendant carried out the instructions of the First Defendant, and (iii) the Third Defendant knew what defamatory allegations were to be made before they were made.
In paragraphs 69 of his first witness statement, Mr Scott states that the solicitors for the Third and Fourth Defendants “have also failed to provide any substantive response to the Letter before Claim”.
It is complained that this compounded earlier references by Mr Scott to the contents of the pre-action correspondence which failed to point out that the limited role played by the Third and Fourth Defendants had been explained by their solicitors; that merely exhibiting the pre-action letters from those solicitors was not sufficient; that the materials obtained from Harris Media, which were not disclosed, in fact contradicted the Claimant’s case against the Third and Fourth Defendants; and that this failure was “substantial and likely a deliberate decision”.
Mr Sherborne’s written submissions concerning the Third and Fourth Defendants’ case on the alleged failure to comply with the duty of full and frank disclosure were partly devoted to addressing points which Mr Sinai did not pursue at the hearing. For example, the complaint in the Third Defendant’s witness statement that the failure to provide the Third and Fourth Defendants with disclosure of the documents obtained by the Claimant from Harris Media was itself a breach of the duty was answered in Mr Scott’s second witness statement by pointing out (among other things) that the Defendants had these documents in any event, and was not pursued by Mr Sinai.
Mr Sherborne’s main submissions (supported by the evidence of Mr Scott contained in his second witness statement) with regard to the points set out above were as follows: (i) Mr Scott’s first witness statement contained a fair presentation of the issues overall, including the position of the Third and Fourth Defendants; (ii) this included Mr Scott’s presentation of the contents of the pre-action correspondence, which was in any event included in the exhibit to that witness statement, as expressly stated by Mr Scott in paragraph 3 of the same; (iii) there was no obligation to place before Senior Master Cook the materials obtained from Harris Media, which in any event did not contradict or undermine the Claimant’s case, both (a) because they were documents obtained in response to an order of the court in Texas which was of limited ambit, and could fairly be presumed to form only part of the communications which evidence the Third Defendant’s involvement in the Campaign, and (b) because they were, by themselves, sufficient to show that the Claimant’s claims against the Third and Fourth Defendants had a real prospect of success; and (iv) proper application of the principles and guidance contained in the decided cases led to the conclusion that there had plainly been no failure to comply with the duty of full and frank disclosure.
When considering these rival contentions, I bear in mind, in particular, the following points. On the one hand, “It is important to uphold the requirement of full and frank disclosure” (Sloutsker at [51](iii)) and “It is a high duty and of the first importance to ensure the integrity of the court’s process” (Tugushev at [7](i)). Further, “Full disclosure must be linked with fair presentation” (Tugushev at [7](i)) and “The evidence and argument must be presented and summarised in a way which, taken as a whole, is not misleading or unfairly one-sided” (Fundo Soberano de Angola at [52]). On the other hand, while “The duty requires an applicant to make the court aware of the issues likely to arise and the possible difficulties in the claim”, the duty “need not extend to a detailed analysis of every possible point which may arise” (Tugushev at [7](v)). Further, “a due sense of proportion must be kept”, “sensible limits have to be drawn”, and, at the end of the day, “The question is not whether the evidence in support could have been improved (or one to be approached with the benefit of hindsight). The primary question is whether in all the circumstances its effect was such as to mislead the court in any material respect” (see Tugushev at [7](vi)).
In my judgment, the Defendants have the better part of the argument on this issue. I consider that the way in which the case was presented in Mr Scott’s evidence gave the impression that the case against each of the Defendants was of equal or similar strength, failed to flag up the narrow nature of the concrete pleaded case against the Second Defendant, and suggested that the unlawful means conspiracy claim was quite straightforward as against each of the Defendants, without addressing fairly whether the evidence and the way in which the claim had been pleaded was sufficient to support such serious allegations, specifically as against the Second Defendant.
In particular: (i) that evidence presented the case against the Second Defendant in stronger and different terms than the case pleaded in the Particulars of Claim; (ii) the statement that the disclosure obtained from Harris Media showed that the Third Defendant had provided instructions to Harris Media to operate the Campaign was an overstatement (see [140](4) above); and (iii) the statement that this disclosure showed that the Second and Fourth Defendants paid invoices issued by Harris Media was misleading in light of the pleaded case on payment of instalments contained in paragraphs 97.2 and 97.5.4 of the Particulars of Claim. These matters were compounded by the decision not to include the materials the Claimant had obtained from Harris Media as a result of the proceedings in Texas in the evidence before Senior Master Cook, because this deprived the Court of the opportunity to consider for itself whether Mr Scott’s characterisation was fair or one-sided (see [140](4) above).
I do not consider that there is any basis for saying that this was done deliberately, in order to conceal the extent to which those materials contained only limited pointers towards the involvement of the Second, Third and Fourth Defendants. However, I have little doubt that if those materials had been thought to provide strong support for the Claimant’s case against any or all of those Defendants then the Claimant’s legal advisers would not have thought it disproportionate to include them in the evidence before the Court. I suspect that what occurred is that either too superficial a view was taken of what those materials showed, and whether they supported points which the Defendants might wish to make, or else, subconsciously, they were thought to be not particularly helpful to the Claimant’s case and were omitted for that reason.
It is not easy to say what would have happened if the duty of full and frank disclosure had been complied with. In keeping with the conclusions that I have reached on the Merits Test with the benefit of detailed argument from all parties and far more time than was available to Senior Master Cook, the outcome would have been to grant the application for permission to serve out as against the First, Third and Fourth Defendants, but to refuse it as against the Second Defendant. Another possibility is that Senior Master Cook might have adjourned the application to ask for further assistance with regard to the points which, in accordance with my analysis, ought to have been brought to his attention. In any event, it seems to me that there is no reason to suppose that he would not have granted permission either immediately or following further argument as against the First, Third and Fourth Defendants. In addition, permission might have been granted against the Second Defendant as well, as it is possible he might have reached a different conclusion to me on the Merits Test.
In these circumstances, I consider it right to impose a sanction for the breaches that I have held to be made out, but at the same time I consider that it would be going too far to set aside the Order of Senior Master Cook on these grounds. In my judgment, the appropriate way in which to mark the failures to comply with the duty of full and frank disclosure which occurred in this case is by ordering that the Claimant should be deprived of his costs of the application that he made before Senior Master Cook.
ABUSE OF PROCESS
Mr Hodson argued that the present claim constitutes an abuse of process because “It is plainly brought for the collateral purpose of pursuing the Claimant’s vendetta against the First Defendant, arising from her family’s refusal to bow to his demands” and “The purpose of this claim is not vindication of rights … [but] to intimidate and harass the First Defendant and anyone connected with her”. In support of these submissions, Mr Hodson relied on the First Defendant’s evidence as to a campaign of harassment against her and her family, for which she claimed the Claimant was responsible, and the very large claim for in excess of £2.1m contained in the Annexe to the Particulars of Claim (see [28] above) which he criticised as set out in [58] above.
Mr Sinai did not in terms allege abuse of process, but submitted that (i) it is not clear what the Claimant seeks to achieve by suing the Third and Fourth Defendants, (ii) the pleaded allegations do not support the £2.1m or more claimed, and (iii) the Court is entitled to question the claim against the Third and Fourth Defendants.
In my judgment, it is impossible to accept Mr Hodson’s submissions. On the face of it, the Claimant’s claims are substantial and well founded. As Warby LJ remarked in Soriano “… defamation remains a relatively simple tort to prove”. Further, for the reasons rehearsed in detail above, not only is the claim for unlawful means conspiracy, in factual terms, closely connected to the claim for defamation, in particular so far as that claim relies on accessory liability, but also and in any event it, too, cannot be said to be unmeritorious. A genuine desire to obtain vindication of rights cannot be peremptorily ruled out, and indeed, on the basis of the facts alleged in the Particulars of Claim, seems entirely plausible. As for the suggested collateral purpose, the Claimant denies pursuing a campaign of harassment against the First Defendant and her family, and that factual dispute cannot be resolved on the materials at present before the Court. The claim contained in the Annexe is certainly of a remarkable magnitude, but whether that is due to unwarranted exaggeration or because the matters complained of have caused the Claimant an extraordinary amount of financial harm is a matter for trial, and if and to the extent that the former is correct the claim will fail.
Mr Sinai’s points also, in my opinion, come nowhere near to justifying rejection of any of the Claimant’s claims. First, the Claimant is not required to demonstrate what he seeks to achieve by suing the Third and Fourth Defendants, but, in any event, it seems clear that this involves at the very least (a) establishing the full details of the Campaign, and (b) ensuring that he obtains relief, including the grant of injunctions if appropriate, against all those who were responsible for it. Second, whether the pleaded allegations support the £2.1m or more claimed is a matter for trial. Third, there are no obvious grounds for “questioning” the claim against the Third and Fourth Defendants, but even if there were that would not warrant granting their present application.
CONCLUSION
For these reasons: (i) I grant the application of the Second Defendant, (ii) I dismiss the applications of the First, Third and Fourth Defendants, and (iii) I order that the Claimant’s costs of his application dated 10 May 2024 must be borne by him.
So far as concerns the costs of and occasioned by the Defendants’ applications before me, my provisional view is as follows: (i) there should be no order as to costs as between the Claimant on the one hand and the First and Second Defendants on the other hand (because the First Defendant failed on the application, the Second Defendant succeeded on the application, I am minded to treat the parties’ costs arising from the application of those Defendants as being equally attributable to each of them, and while the Second Defendant only succeeded on the Merits Test at the same time it made a complaint of failure to comply with the duty of full and frank disclosure which succeeded although it did not succeed on the grounds advanced on behalf of those two Defendants but instead did so on some of the grounds advanced on behalf of the Third and Fourth Defendants), and (ii) as between the Claimant and the Third and Fourth Defendants, the Claimant should be awarded 40% of his overall costs (because I am minded to treat 50% of the Claimant’s costs as being attributable to responding to the Third and Fourth Defendants’ application, to regard the Claimant as being the substantial winner of the dispute with them, but to make a 20% reduction in the costs to which the Claimant would otherwise be entitled to reflect their success with regard to the issue of failure to comply with the duty of full and frank disclosure).
I emphasise that this is necessarily a provisional view, but I express it in the hope that it may assist the parties to agree, or at least narrow, any arguments about costs.
I ask Counsel to agree an order which reflects the substantive rulings above. I will deal with submissions on any points which remain in dispute as to the form of the order, and on any other issues such as costs and permission to appeal, either when judgment is handed down, or on an adjourned hearing on some other convenient date.

HARBRON RECRUIT LIMITED
Appellant
and
THE COMMISSIONERS FOR
HIS MAJESTY’S REVENUE AND CUSTOMS
Respondents
DECISION
Introduction and summary
Harbron Recruit Ltd (“HRL”) is a family firm, of which Mr James Harbron is the managing director. HRL contracts with end-clients in the construction industry to provide labour and identifies workers to carry out the required tasks.  During the time with which this appeal is concerned (“the relevant time”) HRL did not engage the workers. Instead, it contracted with intermediary agencies, and those agencies engaged the workers.
Historically, HRL treated the agencies as its own subcontractors, and deducted tax from payments made unless the agencies had “gross” status under the Construction Industry Scheme (“CIS”).
In April 2014, new provisions were introduced which deemed workers to be employed by agencies if they were subject to “supervision, direction or control” by the agency.  HRL took appropriate professional advice on how these new rules would affect its business.
Mr Harbron understood that as a result of these changes, it did not need to apply CIS to the payments made to the agencies, because the workers were all being paid net of tax under PAYE.  HRL therefore made nil CIS returns from 5 May 2017.
On 21 October 2020, HMRC opened a “check” of HRL’s PAYE, VAT and CIS compliance.  On 8 March 2021, HMRC issued HRL with a “Warning Letter” under Reg 13(1) of the Income Tax (Construction Industry Scheme) Regulations 2015 (“the CIS Regs”) stating that they would raise determinations on HRL for £483,675 of CIS (“the excess”) for the years 2017-18 through to 2021-22 in relation to its payments to the agencies.
In response, HRL wrote to HMRC asking for a determination that it was not liable to pay the excess because Condition A or Condition B of Reg 9 of the CIS Regs applied.  Condition A is that HRL had acted with reasonable care and Condition B is the agencies had paid the tax due on the related profits.
HMRC accepted that Condition B applied to £129,513 of the excess, but refused to apply Condition A.  HRL appealed and asked for a statutory review.  The review officer upheld the decision, and HRL notified its appeal to the Tribunal.
The case was twice listed for an oral hearing, but both hearings were postponed. The parties then asked that the appeal be determined on the papers under Rule 29 of the Tribunal Procedure (First-tier Tribunal) (Tax Chamber) Rules 2009 (“the Tribunal Rules”), and I considered that it was in the interests of justice to do so.
Having considered the facts, the law, and the submissions of both parties, I agreed that HRL had acted with reasonable care, for the reasons explained at §88, and I allowed the appeal.
I also considered and rejected a submission made by HMRC that, if HRL won its appeal, the case would be remitted back to HMRC for it to make further decisions on essentially the same facts, see §68ff.
All statutory provisions referred to in this Decision are cited only so far as relevant to the issue before the Tribunal.
The Evidence
The Tribunal was provided with a bundle of 1,822 pages, which included:
Correspondence between the parties, and between the parties and the Tribunal;
print-outs from HMRC’s system showing HRL’s CIS returns;
HRL’s bank statements from December 2019 to January 2020;
HRL’s VAT returns for periods 4/20; 7/20; 10/20 and 1/21;
HRL’s supplier invoices from April 2017 to November 2020, and from August 2020 to February 2021; and
invoices from one agency from November 2019 to February 2020; and from another from February to October 2020.
The Tribunal was also provided with witness statements from Mr Harbron and Mr Richard Clutterbuck.  At the relevant time Mr Clutterbuck worked for CIS Tax Advice Ltd (“CISTAL”), the professional firm which provided advice to HRL, although he moved to a new firm, GuildHub Consulting Ltd, before he made his statement.
Because this appeal was listed to be decided on the papers, it was not possible for HMRC to cross-examine Mr Harbron or Mr Clutterbuck on their evidence.  However, HMRC did not submit that either witness statements was untrue or misleading.  I found the evidence contained within both statements to be consistent with other documents in the Bundle and accepted it. The witness statements also included submissions, which I took into account (alongside the submissions made by HMRC) when deciding whether or not to allow the appeal.
Although HMRC relied on their CIS guidance as set out in booklet CIS340 (“the CIS Guidance”), the Bundle did not include the version in use during the relevant period.  I  therefore referred to the current edition, together with the list of updates shown on the landing page of the website.  In reliance on that update information, I find that the passages from the CIS Guidance cited in this Decision were present during the relevant period.
On the basis of the evidence summarised above, I make the findings of fact in this Decision.
The CIS provisions
The CIS provisions are found in Finance Act 2004 (“FA 2004”), Part 3, Chapter 3, and in the CIS Regs, which are made under the vires given by that Act.  FA 2004, s 57 begins:
This Chapter provides for certain payments (see section 60) under construction contracts to be made under deduction of sums on account of tax (see sections 61 and 62).
In this Chapter “construction contract” means a contract relating to construction operations (see section 74) which is not a contract of employment but where—
one party to the contract is a sub-contractor (see section 58); and
another party to the contract (“the contractor”) either—
is a sub-contractor under another such contract relating to all or any of the construction operations, or
is a person to whom section 59 applies.
In sections 60 and 61 “the contractor” has the meaning given by this section.
Section 58 is headed “Sub-contractors” and reads:
“For the purposes of this Chapter a party to a contract relating to construction operations is a sub-contractor if, under the contract—
he is under a duty to the contractor to carry out the operations, or to furnish his own labour (in the case of a company, the labour of employees or officers of the company) or the labour of others in the carrying out of the operations or to arrange for the labour of others to be furnished in the carrying out of the operations; or
he is answerable to the contractor for the carrying out of the operations by others, whether under a contract or under other arrangements made or to be made by him.”
Section 59 defines “contractor” as including by subsection (1)(a), “any person carrying on a business which includes construction operations”.
Section 60 is headed “contract payments” and begins:
In this Chapter “contract payment” means any payment which is made under a construction contract and is so made by the contractor (see section 57(3)) to—
the sub-contractor,
a person nominated by the sub-contractor or the contractor, or
a person nominated by a person who is a sub-contractor under another such contract relating to all or any of the construction operations.
But a payment made under a construction contract is not a contract payment if any of the following exceptions applies in relation to it.
This exception applies if the payment is treated as earnings from an employment by virtue of Chapter 7 of Part 2 of the Income Tax (Earnings and Pensions) Act 2003 (c 1) (agency workers)….”
Section 61 then provides that a “contractor” must deduct “the relevant percentage£ from any “contract payment”.  The Finance Act 2004, Section 61(2), (Relevant Percentage) Order 2007 provides that the “relevant percentage” is 20% unless the subcontractor is not registered for CIS, when it is 30%.
Reg 9 reads:
This regulation applies if—
it appears to an officer of Revenue and Customs that the deductible amount exceeds the amount actually deducted, and
condition A or B is met.
In this regulation—
“the deductible amount” is the amount which a contractor was liable to deduct on account of tax from a contract payment under section 61 of the Act in a tax period;
“the amount actually deducted” is the amount actually deducted by the contractor on account of tax from a contract payment under section 61 of the Act during that tax period;
“the excess” means the amount by which the deductible amount exceeds the amount actually deducted.
Condition A is that the contractor satisfies an officer of Revenue and Customs—
that he took reasonable care to comply with section 61 of the Act and these Regulations, and
that—
the failure to deduct the excess was due to an error made in good faith, or
he held a genuine belief that section 61 of the Act did not apply to the payment.
Condition B is that—
an officer of Revenue and Customs is satisfied that the person to whom the contractor made the contract payments to which section 61 of the Act applies either—
was not chargeable to income tax or corporation tax in respect of those payments, or
has made a return of his income or profits in accordance with section 8 of TMA (personal return) or paragraph 3 of Schedule 18 to the Finance Act 1998 (company tax return), in which those payments were taken into account, and paid the income tax and Class 4 contributions due or corporation tax due in respect of such income or profits;
and
the contractor requests that the Commissioners for Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs make a direction under paragraph (5).
An officer of Revenue and Customs may direct that the contractor is not liable to pay the excess to the Commissioners for Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs.
If condition A is not met an officer of Revenue and Customs may refuse to make a direction under paragraph (5) by giving notice to the contractor (“the refusal notice”) stating—
the grounds for the refusal, and
the date on which the refusal notice was issued.
A contractor may appeal against the refusal notice—
by notice to an officer of Revenue and Customs,
within 30 days of the refusal notice,
specifying the grounds of the appeal.
For the purpose of paragraph (7) the grounds of appeal are that—
that the contractor took reasonable care to comply with section 61 of the Act and these Regulations, and
that—
the failure to deduct the excess was due to an error made in good faith, or
the contractor held a genuine belief that section 61 of the Act did not apply to the payment.
If on an appeal under paragraph (7) that is notified to the tribunal it appears that the refusal notice should not have been issued the tribunal may direct that an officer of Revenue and Customs make a direction under paragraph (5) in an amount the tribunal determines is the excess for one or more tax periods falling within the relevant year…”
Reg 9 therefore allows HMRC to issue a direction that the under-deducted CIS amount (“the excess”) is not collectible from a contractor if either Condition A or Condition B is met.  If HMRC refuse to issue a direction, the contractor can appeal to the Tribunal, but only in relation to Condition B.  I return to these provisions later in this Decision notice.
Reg 13 of the CIS Regs is headed “determination of amounts payable by contractor and appeal against determination”, and it includes the following paragraphs:
This regulation applies if—
…
an officer of Revenue and Customs has reason to believe, as a result of an inspection under regulation 51 or otherwise, that there may be an amount payable for a tax year under these Regulations by a contractor that has not been paid to them, or
an officer of Revenue and Customs considers it necessary in the circumstances.
An officer of Revenue and Customs may determine the amount which to the best of his judgment a contractor is liable to pay under these Regulations, and serve notice of his determination on the contractor.
A determination under this regulation must not include amounts in respect of which a direction under regulation 9(5) has been made and directions under that regulation do not apply to amounts determined under this regulation.”
It follows from Reg 13(3) that a determination under Reg 13 to collect the excess cannot be made if a direction has already been given under Reg 9(5).
The Agency Rules
ITEPA Part 2 Chapter 7 is headed “Application of provisions to agency workers” and  together with related provisions and regulations, sets out what are commonly known as “the agency rules”. Within that Chapter, s 44 is headed “Treatment of workers supplied by agencies”, and since its amendment by Finance Act 2014 (“FA 2014”) reads:
This section applies if
an individual (""the worker"") personally provides services (which are not excluded services) to another person (""the client""),
there is a contract between
the client or a person connected with the client, and
a person other than the worker, the client or a person connected with the client (""the agency""), and
under or in consequence of that contract
the services are provided, or
the client or any person connected with the client pays, or otherwise provides consideration, for the services.
But this section does not apply if
it is shown that the manner in which the worker provides the services is not subject to (or to the right of) supervision, direction or control by any person, or
remuneration receivable by the worker in consequence of providing the services constitutes employment income of the worker apart from this Chapter.
If this section applies
the worker is to be treated for income tax purposes as holding an employment with the agency, the duties of which consist of the services the worker provides to the client, and
all remuneration receivable by the worker (from any person) in consequence of providing the services is to be treated for income tax purposes as earnings from that employment…”
In summary, ITEPA s 44 as amended provides that agency workers who are subject to, or to the right of “supervision direction or control by any person” are deemed to be employed for tax purposes.  An equivalent NIC provision, not set out above, came into force around the same time.
FA 2014 also introduced a new section 716B into ITEPA, headed “Employment intermediaries to keep, preserve and provide information etc”, which begins:
For purposes connected with Chapter 7 of Part 2 (treatment of workers supplied by agencies) or Part 11 (PAYE), the Commissioners for Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs may by regulations make provision for, or in connection with, requiring a specified employment intermediary
to keep and preserve specified information, records or documents for a specified period;
to provide Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs with specified information, records or documents within a specified period or at specified times.
An ""employment intermediary"" is a person who makes arrangements under or in consequence of which
an individual works, or is to work, for a third person, or
an individual is, or is to be, remunerated for work done for a third person.
For the purposes of subsection (2), an individual works for a person if
the individual performs any duties of an employment for that person (whether or not the individual is employed by that person), or
the individual provides, or is involved in the provision of, a service to that person…
In subsection (1) ""specified"" means specified or described in regulations made under this section.
Regulations under this section may
make different provision for different cases or different purposes, and
make incidental, consequential, supplementary or transitional provision or savings.”
The regulations made under the vires given by ITEPA s 716B are contained in the Income Tax (Pay As You Earn) (Amendment No 2) Regulations.
The CIS Guidance
Section 1 of the CIS Guidance is headed “Introduction to the Construction Industry Scheme”, and it begins:
“This section gives a brief introduction to CIS. The scheme sets out the rules for how payments to subcontractors for construction work must be handled by contractors in the construction industry and certain other businesses.
Under the scheme, all payments made from contractors to subcontractors must take account of the subcontractor’s tax status, as determined by HMRC. This may require the contractor to make a deduction, which they then pay to HMRC, from that part of the payment that does not represent the cost of materials incurred by the subcontractor.”
Section 1.2 defines “contractor” as “a business or other concern that pays subcontractors for construction work” and a “subcontractor” as “a business that carries out construction work for a contractor”.  It then says:
“Many businesses pay other businesses for construction work, but are themselves paid by other businesses too. When they’re working as a contractor, they must follow the rules for contractors and when they’re working as a subcontractor, they must follow the rules for subcontractors.
For a more detailed explanation of what is a contractor and what is a subcontractor, read Section 2.”
After outlining the rules for CIS deductions, the CIS Guidance says at Section 1.8 (headings here and below emboldened in the original):
“The scheme does not apply to employees
For a contract to be within the scheme, it must not be ‘a contract of employment’. This means that the scheme applies to workers who are self-employed under the terms of the contract, and who are not employees subject to Pay As You Earn (PAYE).
Employment status depends on general law and it’s for the contractor to decide on the individual’s employment status when the subcontractor is first engaged. The fact that the subcontractor has worked in a self-employed capacity before is irrelevant in deciding on their employment status — it’s the terms of the particular engagement that matter.”
Section 2 includes the following subsections:
Subcontractors
A subcontractor is a person or body that has agreed to carry out construction operations for a contractor. The subcontractor may be carrying out the  operations in any way, including:
carrying out the operations themselves
having the operations done by their own employees or subcontractors
Subcontractors include:
companies, corporate bodies or public bodies, as well as any self-employed individual running a business or partnership
labour agencies or staff bureaux that contract to get work done with theirown workforce, or to supply workers to a contractor…
….
Agencies as subcontractors
Where a worker is supplied to a contractor by or through an agency and the worker carries out construction operations under the terms of a contract they have with the agency, the agency supplying the worker will be a subcontractor as far as the contractor is concerned. The contractor must always apply the scheme when making payment to the agency.
Where a worker is merely introduced to the contractor by an agency and subsequently carries out construction operations under the terms of a contract they have with the contractor, the agency is not a subcontractor in this case.
Rules for agency workers
Special rules apply to agency workers (Footnote: 1) who normally treat the worker as an employee for tax and National Insurance contributions purposes. The business paying the worker should normally deduct tax under PAYE and account for Class 1 National Insurance contributions.
Very exceptionally, the special rules for agency workers do not apply and any payments for construction work will fall within the scheme. The agency will then be a contractor and will need to fulfil its obligations in that role.”
The facts
I first set out the background facts and then those relating to the dispute.
HRL’s business
Mr Harbron’s parents had previously run a formwork company (a company which specialises in constructing temporary structures to support concrete during construction) and owned a related agency.  Those businesses closed during the 1980s recession, but as Mr Harbron had become familiar with the construction business, he relied on that experience to set up HRL.  He is HRL’s managing director and owns 35% of the shares; his wife and parents own the remainder.  It is thus a small family business.
HRL identifies workers suitable for roles within construction projects in the local area, ranging from general operatives, machine operators, carpenters, bricklayers, plasterers and electricians right up to senior site managers, quantity surveyors and account directors.  Once workers are accepted as suitable by the end-client, HRL directs them to an agency, which engages them. The contractual chain is thus as follows:
Construction company contracts with HRL to supply workers;
HRL contracts with agency to supply workers;
Agency contracts with workers to provide services to end-client.
The change to the agency rules
In 2014, the agency rules changed.  As noted above, ITEPA s 44 was amended to provide that agency workers who were subject to, or to the right of “supervision direction or control by any person” were deemed to be employed for tax purposes.
HRL received a large number of newsletters and other information from external firms, such as human resource companies and payroll providers, warning that if a worker was not correctly identified as a deemed employee, but was instead treated as within CIS, the agency could be liable for all the under-deducted PAYE and NICs.
The staff changes and the accountants
At around the same time, Mr Harbron’s mother, who had been responsible for the operation of CIS, had to retire for health reasons, and the other two experienced finance staff also left the business.  Mr Harbron recognised he did not have the skills necessary to deal with finance issues, as his role had always been in business development and sales.  He instructed HRL’s accountants, Darnells, a well-known and respected local firm, to manage the function while new staff were recruited, and to interview the applicants to ensure that the candidate who was appointed had the necessary skills.
Mr Harbron also recognised that specialist advice was required in the light of the change to the agency rules, and he instructed CISTAL to carry out a complete review of HRL’s operations, including compliance with its obligations under CIS and the agency rules.  CISTAL is a subsidiary of Francis Clark LLP (“Francis Clark”), a large and reputable accountancy practice based in the West Country.  CISTAL was set up by Francis Clark specifically to provide specialist advice on CIS and related issues.
CISTAL’s review was carried out by Mr Clutterbuck; he had previously worked for over thirty years for HMRC, initially as a Compliance Officer and then a Senior Manager; he dealt predominantly with CIS and employment tax.  Given his role and background, I find as a fact that he had read and was familiar with:
the CIS legislation and regulations;
the CIS Guidance; and
the agency rules.
Mr Clutterbuck carried out a health check on HRL and identified only minor issues.  One of HRL’s directors then designed a program to ensure that workers who were within the agency rules were identified as such. This was a significant financial investment, and Mr Harbron instructed CISTAL to carry out a further review. Mr Steve Ashworth, Tax Director at Francis Clark, subsequently confirmed in correspondence with HMRC that CISTAL was being engaged to and actually did provide support “in relation to both aspects”, ie both CIS and the agency rules, and I find this to be a fact.
Mr Clutterbuck carried out that further review, and having done so, confirmed that HRL’s software met the legal requirements.  He also advised that HRL should make reports to HMRC under s 716B, because it was an employment intermediary as defined under s 716B(2), namely “a person who makes arrangements under or in consequence of which (a) an individual works, or is to work,  for a third person, or (b)  an individual is, or is to be, remunerated for work done for a third  person”.  The agencies told HRL that they were applying ITEPA s 44; deeming the workers to be employees, and deducting PAYE and NICs.
Around the same time as CISTAL was carrying out its review, Mr Harbron decided to transfer overall responsibility for advising on HRL’s accounting and tax issues from Darnells to Francis Clarke.  HRL also recruited a new senior member of staff with a strong construction background, including experience of CIS; when she left, her replacement was another finance manager with similar background and experience.
The change of approach
Having taken advice both from an external specialist firm and from internal experienced finance staff, Mr Harbron understood the position to be as follows:
the workers being contracted were subject to supervision direction and control;
they were thus deemed to be employed by the agencies and were not within CIS;
PAYE and NIC was deducted and paid over to HMRC by the agencies;
by completing the detailed returns required under ITEPA s 716B, HMRC were being provided with information relating to the workers; and
HRL therefore did not have to operate CIS in relation to its payments to the agencies.
As a result, in May 2017 HRL changed its approach, and completed CIS returns on a nil basis. Mr Ashworth subsequently accepted that the advice given to HRL “may have lacked clarity in certain elements”, while Mr Harbron acknowledged t he had misunderstood the position.  Nevertheless, during the next three years, the error was not identified by any of HRL’s external or internal professionals.
HMRC compliance checks
On 18 May 2017, HMRC opened a check into HRL’s compliance with its CIS obligations, and arranged to visit the premises.  However, that visit was postponed by HMRC and subsequently cancelled.  HRL heard nothing further and were never told why HMRC had not taken any further action in relation to this compliance check.
On 21 October 2020, Officer Jason Purdy opened a second compliance check, this time into HRL’s PAYE, VAT and CIS compliance as part of an exercise to prevent businesses being “caught up in” fraudulent supply chains.
HRL provided extensive information in response to Officer Purdy’s questions, and on 9 December 2020, Officer Purdy wrote back, saying:
“Harbron Recruit Ltd are of the understanding NIL submissions are correct as they use intermediary companies. You have detailed that the company offersconstruction specific roles and make supplies of labour to the construction sector.  I refer to section 2.12 in the Construction Industry Scheme Guide (CIS 340)  which details how contractors such as Harbron Recruit Ltd should treat payments to sub-contractors who supply workers via an agency.
I have attached a link to the CIS 340 guide…This confirms that a contractor, in this case Harbron Recruit Ltd must always apply the Construction Industry Scheme (CIS) when making a payment to an agency. For CIS purposes this is a contractor and sub-contractor relationship, therefore NIL submissions are incorrect and payments made to agencies/sub-contractors should take account of their tax status as determined by HMRC.
I take on board Harbron Recruit Ltd comments on quarterly intermediary reports for HMRC and that the intermediaries pay the workers via PAYE however this is not relevant in determining if payments fall under scope of the Construction Industry Scheme (CIS). Whether a payment falls within the  scope of the CIS scheme is determined by the type of work carried out and from the information provided it appears that the company is supplying workers for construction work. Therefore, all payments made by Harbron Recruit to agencies for construction related activities within the scope of the CIS scheme should take account of the subcontractor/agencies tax status as determined by HMRC.”
On 4 March 2021, a telephone conference (“the Meeting”) took place between Officer Purdy and another HMRC officer on the one hand, and Mr Harbron, together with Mr Ashworth and Mr Bishop of Francis Clark on the other. The meeting discussed both CIS and VAT issues.
On 8 March 2021 (updated on 29 March 2021) HMRC issued a “Warning Letter” under Reg 13(1) of the CIS Reg stating that they would raise determinations on HRL for £483,675 for the years 2017-18 through to 2020-21 as set out below.

On 28 April 2021, Mr Ashworth wrote to HMRC, asking them to direct that either or both of Condition A or B of Reg 9 applied.  As set out earlier in this Decision, Condition A was that HRL was not liable to pay the excess because it had acted with reasonable care; Condition B was that the subcontractors had paid income or corporation tax on the related profits.
On 2 June 2021, Officer Lin Hale issued HRL with a direction that Condition B applied to the excess relating to C Ltd for 2017-18 of £129,513.  In  a separate decision letter of the same date, she refused to apply Condition A to the remaining sum of £354,162.  She said:
“I am not satisfied the criteria in Regulation 9(4) Condition B of the Income Tax (Construction Industry Scheme) Regulations 2005 have been met and I am now notifying you of my decision.”
On behalf of HRL, Mr Ashworth appealed against the refusal to apply Condition A.  He said:
“Our client now fully appreciates that this understanding was not correct, but this does not change the facts that during the period under review it was genuinely believed that nil CIS returns were appropriate because employment intermediaries reports were being submitted. This was a genuine mistake.”
Mr Ashworth also asked for a statutory review, following which Officer Hale issued a “view of the matter” letter, in which she said:
“You failed to operate the Construction Industry Scheme on payments made to subcontractors engaged by you. You have not demonstrated that you took reasonable care in finding out your obligations under the scheme.
I do not consider that the further explanation about the failure to operate the Construction Industry Scheme has provided any additional information for me to consider that the original decision not to grant relief was incorrect, therefore I have not changed my view of the matter.”
Officer Telfer carried out that statutory review.  He set out the “point at issue” as being “whether the company took reasonable care to comply with section 61 of the Finance Act 2004 and the CIS Regulations” and then said:
“The Regulation 9(6) refusal notice was issued because it was not considered that the company had met the requirement at Regulation 9(3)(a) of the CIS Regulations that reasonable care had been taken to comply with section 61 of the Finance Act 2004 and the CIS Regulations.”
Officer Telfer went on to uphold Officer Hale’s decision, and on 6 January 2022, HRL notified its appeal to the Tribunal. The parties then entered ADR, but this was unsuccessful.  The case was twice listed for an oral hearing, but both were postponed. The parties then asked for the appeal be determined on the papers under Rule 29 and it was listed before me.
What is (and what is not) in Issue
I next set out what points are not in issue, and what matters are to be decided by the Tribunal.
The underlying technical issue
By or soon after the Meeting, there was no dispute that HMRC were technically correct.  Payments between HRL and the agencies were within CIS, even though the workers were deemed to be employed by the agencies.  This Decision thus does not address the technical issue except in so far as relevant to the reasonableness of HRL’s actions.
The quantum
The statutory review letter and HMRC’s Statement of Case each said that the amount in dispute was £483,675.  Both therefore overlooked the fact that Officer Hale had issued a direction on 2 June 2021 that Condition B applied in relation to £129,513 of the excess.  As a result, the amount under appeal is £354,162 (£483,675 less £129,513).  For the avoidance of doubt, this Decision would have extended to the £129,513 had it remained in issue.
Condition B
HMRC refused to direct that Condition B applied to the remaining amounts, but Reg 9 does not give a person a right of appeal against that refusal.  This was described as “odd” by Judge Berner in Hoskins v HMRC [2012] UKFTT 284 (TC), given that whether or not a subcontractor (here, the agencies) had paid the correct tax was “a straightforward issue” on which a Tribunal could make a finding of fact.
I also note that as drafted Condition B only gives relief where the subcontractor has paid corporation tax or income tax on its own profits, and does not extend to cases where tax and NICs are paid by employees (including deemed employees) of the subcontractor.
Notwithstanding those points, the statute does not allow HRL to appeal against HMRC’s refusal to apply Condition B to its other subcontractors, and the Tribunal has no related jurisdiction.
VAT
As is clear from the findings of fact, Officer Purdy’s compliance check also included VAT, and the Bundle included numerous related documents.  Mr Harbron’s witness statement said that:
HMRC raised VAT assessments as the result of the compliance check;
HRL appealed on the basis that it had taken reasonable care; and
the assessments were subsequently cancelled.
As a result, this Decision does not address any VAT matters.
Condition A
In consequence of the foregoing, the only issue for me to decide is whether HMRC were right to refuse to direct that Condition A applied, and the only grounds of appeal I can consider are those set out at Reg 9(8), namely that HRL:
took reasonable care to comply with section 61 of the Act and these Regulations, and
that—
the failure to deduct the excess was due to an error made in good faith, or
[HRL] held a genuine belief that section 61 of the Act did not apply to the payment.”
One of HRL’s grounds of appeal was that HMRC had initiated the first compliance check because they had identified the error in the CIS returns, but had then allowed the business to go on making incorrect returns for three further years.  Mr Harbron said that this was a breach of HMRC’s obligations to taxpayers.  However, that submission is not one of the permitted grounds set out in Reg 9(8), so cannot be considered by the Tribunal.
There is one further issue to be resolved in relation to the scope and application of Condition A.  HMRC’s Statement of Case says:
“HMRC submits that this case concerns whether reasonable care was taken by the Appellant and only if this can be satisfied then can consideration be given as to whether the failure to deduct the tax was due to an error made in good faith or the Appellant held a genuine belief that section 61 did not apply to payments he had made.”
This implies that if the Tribunal finds that HRL took reasonable care, the case will revert to HMRC to make further decisions as to (a) whether the error was made in good faith and (b) whether there was the necessary genuine belief.  I disagree for the reasons explained below.
The Officer is required to set out the grounds for the refusal
Reg 9(6) reads (my emphasis):
“If condition A is not met an officer of Revenue and Customs may refuse to make a direction under paragraph (5) by giving notice to the contractor (“the refusal notice”) stating—
the grounds for the refusal, and
the date on which the refusal notice was issued”.
Officer Hale’s decision letter issued on 2 June 2021 said that the refusal notice was issued on the grounds that she was “not satisfied that the criteria in Regulation 9(4) Condition B of the Income Tax (Construction Industry Scheme) Regulations 2005 have been met”. In her subsequent “view of the matter” letter, she said that, having considered further information provided, she had not “changed [her] view” because HRL “have not demonstrated that [it] took reasonable care in finding out [its] obligations under the [CIS] scheme”.
These two letters, taken together, show that the only criterion which in Officer Hale’s view had not been met was that HRL had not demonstrated reasonable care.  Officer Telfer, who carried out the statutory review, confirmed that this was the position when he said:
“The Regulation 9(6) refusal notice was issued because it was not considered that the company had met the requirement at Regulation 9(3)(a) of the CIS Regulations that reasonable care had been taken to comply with section 61 of the Finance Act 2004 and the CIS Regulations.”
A single procedure
There is no suggestion in any of the three letters referred to above that HMRC had reserved their position in relation to “good faith” or “genuine belief”.  This would in any event be impermissible, because:
Reg 9(6) requires HMRC to set out their grounds for refusal;
the company has the right to appeal against that refusal; and
Reg 9(9) then provides that the Tribunal “may direct that [HMRC] make a direction under paragraph (5) in an amount the tribunal determines is the excess for one or more tax periods falling within the relevant year”.
Thus, Reg 9 sets out a single procedure, as the result of which the Tribunal determines whether the company is responsible for the excess and the correct amount of any excess.  Nothing in the statute supports HMRC’s submission that there is a two or three stage process, under which HMRC have a second or third bite of the cherry if they lose the initial appeal.
No case law support
HMRC’s Statement of Case also does not refer to any case law which would support this two or three stage approach.  Having reviewed previous FTT judgments, I have not identified any previous decision in which HMRC have put forward this view of the law, let alone one which upholds this approach.
Interests of justice
Moreover, if HMRC were to be correct, the decision and appeal process would be extremely time-consuming and inefficient, with matters of fact being decided long after the events in question, and the parties potentially bringing the same dispute before the Tribunal on two or three sequential occasions.  That would plainly not be in the interests of justice.
Observations
For completeness, I add the following observations about the other parts of Condition A:
In relation to “genuine belief”, it is clear from the findings of fact made in this Decision that Mr Harbron genuinely believed he was acting correctly, and this has never been challenged or disputed by HMRC.
In relation to “good faith”, as Peter Smith J said in R&C Commrs v Infinity Distribution [2015] UKUT 219 (TCC) at [11], “it is well established that an allegation of lack of good faith is tantamount to an allegation of fraud”.  No such allegation has been made by HMRC; none of the evidence provided for this appeal would support such an allegation, and the burden of proving a lack of good faith would be on HMRC.
In summary
The refusal decision at issue in this case was made because Officer Hale considered that HRL had not acted with reasonable care, and for no other reason.  That is the decision which is now before the Tribunal.  If HRL succeeds in its appeal, HMRC cannot then make further decisions about HRL’s lack of “genuine belief” and/or “good faith”.
The issue I have to decide is therefore whether HRL, acting through Mr Harbron, “took reasonable care”.
What is “reasonable care”
In HMRC v Hicks [2020] UKUT 12 (TCC), the Upper Tribunal held at [120] that:
“Whether acts or omissions are careless involves a factual assessment  having regard to all the relevant circumstances of the case. There are many decided cases as to what amounts to carelessness in relation to the completion of a self-assessment tax return. The cases indicate that the conduct of the individual taxpayer is to be assessed by reference to a prudent and reasonable taxpayer in his position: see, for example, Atherton v HMRC [2019] STC 575 (Fancourt J and Judge Scott) at [37].”
In Perrin v HMRC [2018] UKUT 156 (TCC) (“Perrin”) the UT considered the test for a “reasonable excuse”, and held at [81(3)] that the Tribunal had first to find the facts, and then decide:
“…whether, viewed objectively, those proven facts do indeed amount to an objectively reasonable excuse for the default and the time when that objectively reasonable excuse ceased. In doing so, it should take into account the experience and other relevant attributes of the taxpayer and the situation in which the taxpayer found himself at the relevant time or times. It might assist the FTT, in this context, to ask itself the question “was what the taxpayer did (or omitted to do or believed) objectively reasonable for this taxpayer in those circumstances?”
In Hextall v HMRC [2023] FTT 00390 (TC) at [74] the Tribunal (Judge Sinfield and Mr Howard) held at [74] that there was no “meaningful distinction” between the two criteria of “reasonable care” and “reasonable excuse”.  I agree: in both the Tribunal must find the facts, and then on the basis of those facts, determine whether the taxpayer acted as a prudent and reasonable taxpayer (who was in the same situation as the taxpayer and who had same experience and relevant attributes) would have acted.
The parties’ submissions
I first set out HMRC’s submissions, and then those made on behalf of HRL.
Submissions made by HMRC
HMRC’s position was that in submitting nil CIS returns HRL had failed to take reasonable care, because:
it was clear from the CIS Guidance at Sections 2.10 and 2.12 that subcontractors include agencies;
“nowhere is it suggested” in legislation or guidance that the agency rules “include payments for work done in the construction industry”;
HRL’s decision to change its procedures because of the agency rules was “a clear indication that the company did not [take] reasonable care to comply with its obligations” in relation to CIS; and
although HRL did seek advice from CISTAL, it did so because it was confused by the new agency requirements, and did not ask CISTAL about CIS.
HMRC also said that “it is well established that ignorance of the law is not a defence, and the Tribunal has routinely exercised [sic] that view”.
Submissions made on behalf of HRL
Mr Harbron and Mr Clutterbuck submitted that HRL had acted with reasonable care, for the following reasons:
Mr Harbron’s focus throughout had been on making sure that correct tax approach was applied.
He had read the information about the changes to the agency rules and realised he was out of his depth.
He instructed CISTAL, an accountancy firm specialising in the construction industry, to advise HRL and ensure the company remained compliant.
HRL had invested a significant amount of time and money in seeking to establish whether the workers engaged to carry out the tasks for the end-clients were subject to supervision, direction and control.
The interaction of the agency rules and the CIS provisions was complex.
Having taken advice, Mr Harbron had done his best to understand both sets of provisions, and believed that as the workers were all deemed to be employed, HRL would meet its compliance obligations by submitting returns under ITEPA s 716B.
Mr Harbron had also ensured that appropriately skilled staff were recruited for the relevant roles within the company.
None of the external or internal professionals had identified (until this was pointed out by HMRC) that HRL was wrong to submit its CIS returns on a nil basis, and this too showed that the interactions were complex.
Mr Harbron also rejected HMRC’s assertion that this was a case about ignorance of the law; he said it was instead about misunderstanding how two sets of provisions interacted.
The Tribunal’s view
I have set out my view under the following headings:
Ignorance of the law.
The CIS Guidance and the legislation.
Interactions between CIS and the agency rules.
Reliance on advisers.
Ignorance of the law
Submissions about “ignorance of the law” are typically raised where the taxpayer has not known about a particular provision, such as a statutory obligation to report gains on residential property, or to notify liability to the High Income Child Benefit Charge.  Mr Harbron was not ignorant of CIS or the agency rules; he knew about both sets of provisions.  Instead, he misunderstood the law.
In any event, HMRC are wrong to say that (a) ignorance of the law cannot be a reasonable excuse, and (b) the Tribunal has “routinely” endorsed that view.  In Perrin, the UT said at [82]:
“…It is a much-cited aphorism that ‘ignorance of the law is no excuse’, and on occasion this has been given as a reason why the defence of reasonable excuse cannot be available in such circumstances. We see no basis for this argument. Some requirements of the law are well-known, simple and straightforward but others are much less so. It will be a matter of judgment for the FTT in each case whether it was objectively reasonable for the particular taxpayer, in the circumstances of the case, to have been ignorant of the requirement in question, and for how long.”
The CIS guidance and the legislation
HMRC say that it was not reasonable for someone in Mr Harbron’s position to think that the CIS requirements were displaced by the agency rules, because it was clear from the CIS Guidance at Sections 2.10 and 2.12 that subcontractors include agencies.
That is true as far as it goes.  However, it is also relevant that:
Section 1.8 of the CIS Guidance says that “the scheme does not apply to employees”;
Section 2.13 states that “special rules apply to agency workers who normally treat the worker as an employee for tax…purposes”;
the CIS legislation itself, at FA 2004, s 60, provides that a payment under construction contracts made by a contractor is not within CIS if “the payment is treated as earnings from an employment by virtue of Chapter 7 of Part 2 of the Income Tax (Earnings and Pensions) Act 2003 (agency workers)”; and
ITEPA s 716B(2) defines an employment intermediary “for purposes connected with Chapter 7 of Part 2 (treatment of workers supplied by agencies)” as “a person who makes arrangements under or in consequence of which (a) an individual works, or is to work, for a third person, or (b)  an individual is, or is to be, remunerated for work done for a third  person”.  HRL was responsible for arranging for the provision of workers to fill the roles required by the end-clients.
Thus, the CIS Guidance and the legislation, read as whole, show that the interaction of CIS provisions and the agency rules is not straightforward.
Interactions between CIS and the agency rules
HMRC also say that HRL’s decision to change its procedures because of s 44 was “a clear indication that the company did not [take] reasonable care to comply with its obligations” in relation to CIS, given that “nowhere is it suggested” that the agency rules “include payments for work done in the construction industry”.
HMRC are wrong to say that the agency rules do not apply to those working in construction.  They apply whenever the conditions set out in ITEPA s 44 are met, so a construction worker who is subject to “supervision, direction or control by any person” is a deemed employee under the provisions of that section. As Mr Harbron said, whether or not the agency rules apply requires a detailed consideration of the facts of each worker’s case.
Unsurprisingly, given the scope and effect of ITEPA s 44, HMRC are also wrong to say that it has never been suggested that the agency rules “include payments for work done in the construction industry”. Around the time that ITEPA s 44 was amended, HMRC published numerous examples as to how the provisions applied; these remain available on the gov.uk website (Footnote: 3).  Example 4 is John, a joiner/carpenter who works on small-scale construction jobs. Depending on the particular fact pattern, John is either inside or outside the agency rules.
The failure of HMRC’s own officers to appreciate the wide scope of the agency provisions serves to support HRL’s case that the interaction between the two sets of rules is not straightforward.
The agency rules mattered to HRL because its role was to identify suitable workers to fit the roles required by the end-clients. HRL therefore took responsibility for deciding whether those workers were inside the agency rules. but it overlooked the fact that, because the agencies were interposed in the contractual chain, HRL continued to be required to pay them under CIS.
Reliance on advisers
HMRC rightly accepted that:
the statutory test requires consideration of how the reasonable taxpayer in Mr Harbron’s position would have acted;
Mr Harbron knew he lacked the knowledge and understanding to know how to respond to the changes to the agency rules; and
Mr Harbron acted as the reasonable person in his position would have acted when he instructed CISTAL.
However, HMRC go on to say that Mr Harbron sought advice only about the agency rules, and not about CIS.  That is not, however, factually correct see §42: HRL requested and received advice about both sets of provisions.
The Tribunal’s view
I have no hesitation in agreeing with Mr Harbron and Mr Clutterbuck that HRL, acting through Mr Harbron, acted with the level of care which the reasonable person in his position would have showed. That is for the following reasons:
The interaction of the two sets of provisions was technically complex.
Mr Harbron recognised that this was the case, and realised he was out of his depth.
He acted reasonably when he instructed CISTAL, a subsidiary of a highly reputable large firm and a specialist in CIS and employment taxes.
He also acted reasonably in relying on Mr Clutterbuck, a former HMRC Senior Manager with over thirty years experience in CIS and employment law who was familiar with the law and guidance on CIS and the agency rules.
HRL asked for and received professional advice about both CIS and the agency rules.
Mr Harbron also ensured that the staff within HRL were professionally qualified and had the requisite skills, and it was reasonable to rely on them as well as on CISTAL.
This case is a clear example of a situation where, despite Mr Harbron doing his best  to ensure that the correct steps were taken, a mistake was nevertheless made.  However, a mistake does not prevent Condition A being met. As HMRC themselves say in their Compliance Manual at CH1140:
“People do make mistakes. We do not expect perfection. We are simply seeking to establish whether the person has taken the care and attention that could be expected from a reasonable person taking reasonable care in similar circumstances, taking into account the ability and circumstances of the person in question at the time the irregularity was submitted to HMRC.”
Conclusion
For the reasons set out above, HRL’s appeal is allowed.  In accordance with Reg 9(9) of the CIS Regs, I direct that an officer of HMRC make a direction under Reg 9(5) in an amount of nil in relation to each of the years as set out below.

As a result of that earlier direction and this Decision, all the “excess” originally identified by HMRC has been reduced to nil.

DECISION
Introduction
On 16 August 2022, the Respondent seized 85 packages of clothing at Shoreham Road West, Heathrow Airport. The items were described as “used clothing” but were found by the officer to be new items of clothing from major brands such as Adidas, Reebok and Ralph Lauren.
The Respondent refused the Appellant’s request to restore the items seized on 22 September 2022. The Respondent confirmed that decision on review in a letter dated 10 November 2022 (“the review conclusion letter”). This is the Appellant’s appeal against that decision.
Preliminary issues
This case was originally listed for half a day. However, upon reading the papers and hearing from the parties at the outset of this appeal, it became apparent to the Tribunal that the original time estimate would be woefully deficient. Fortunately, the Tribunal were able to accommodate a longer time estimate on the day and were able to sit for the whole day.
In addition to considering a voluminous hearing bundle and an authorities bundle, the Tribunal heard oral evidence from the witnesses, and received detailed skeleton arguments and extensive oral submissions from counsel, Mr Carey and Mr Dean. We are grateful to them.
There were a number of preliminary issues, including an application by the Respondent to strike out the appeal dated 4 October 2023 and an objection by the Respondent to the Appellant relying on its skeleton argument, which had been filed out of time. We were informed at the outset of the hearing that the Respondent no longer sought to pursue its application to strike out, and furthermore, that it would not be taking issue with the late provision by the Appellant of its skeleton argument.
There were two other preliminary matters raised in the Appellant’s skeleton argument, at [34] – [45]. The first matter related to the extent to which the Appellant can challenge the factual position in light of its decision to abandon its challenge to the lawfulness of the seizure.
The second matter related to the Appellant’s contention as to the Respondent’s alleged failure to deal with a number of the grounds of challenge in its Statement of Case, and that it should now therefore be prevented from advancing any case in respect of those grounds. In respect of this, the Appellant contends that the only case advanced in the Respondent’s Statement of Case is that: (i) there were no exceptional circumstances justifying departure from the Respondent’s policy; (ii) the Respondent was correct to consider ownership of the goods and did so correctly; and (iii) the reliance on an agent does not amount to a reasonable excuse.
We note the submissions made and will deal with these two matters in our substantive decision.
Background
The Appellant was incorporated on 15 December 2020. Its registered office is The Cow Shed, Salterton Farm, Salisbury, Wiltshire, United Kingdom SP4 6AL.
The Appellant sells used and vintage branded clothing. Its directors were Mr King and Mr Matthews (Mr King remains a director). We were informed that Mr King and Mr Matthews came up with their business venture in September 2019, inspired by their collective love of vintage clothing with a focus on environmental sustainability. Part of the aim of the business is to avoid goods ending up in a landfill site.
Mr King has provided a witness statement dated 19 October 2023. According to Mr King’s written evidence (and these aspects were not controversial):
Mr King and Mr Matthews met Ed Perkins (“Mr Perkins”) at a market fair and formed a trading relationship with him.
In 2021, the Appellant began to import some goods but left the customs considerations to the shipping agents. The Appellant did not experience any issues with importation. By way of example, Mr King appended to his statement an invoice and shipping invoice from Torgam Trading Co., a company based in California, USA.
In 2022, Mr King and Mr Matthews became aware that Mr Perkins had begun wholesaling used clothes via his Dubai company, EdTex Stock (“EdTex”). The Appellant was interested in trading with EdTex as they could provide CSV. files for the stock as well as competitive prices. The CSV. files could also be uploaded straight to their website with a photograph of each item and brief details, which saved them time in respect of advertising.
On 27 May 2022, the Appellant agreed with Mr Perkins via WhatsApp messages to purchase 3,860 items of clothing for the sum of £48,000 over four equal instalments (£12,000 for each instalment). A screenshot of this agreement was appended to his statement.
On 1 June 2022, an agreed deposit of £2,000 was paid by the Appellant to EdTex to secure the stock. The remaining payment of £10,000 was made on 22 June 2022. Confirmation of the payment of £10,000 (it was in fact £10,027.50) was appended to his statement.
The first shipment was received on 7 July 2022 and the Appellant was very happy with it. The Appellant had no dealings with the shipment, which was handled by EdTex’s shipping agents Usman Industries (“Usman Industries”).
As the first shipment was well received, the Appellant was prepared to continue with the trade and awaited the remaining 2,860 items. As with the first shipment, the Appellant trusted Usman Industries to deal with the customs formalities when importing the items in the second shipment.
On 16 August 2022, the items in the second shipment arrived at Heathrow Airport. The import entry listed the value of the goods as 296.16 AED (£67.21). Officers of the Respondent conducted an examination of the contents of the shipment. The items were found not to have been described accurately and accordingly, they were liable to forfeiture by reason of section 167(1) of the Customs and Excise Management Act 1979 (“CEMA 1979”). The items were seized under section 139(1) and a notice of seizure (Notice 12A) was issued.
The notice is headed “Notice of Seizure for Under-Declared/ Misdeclared Goods”. The items seized were noted as “Goods: 85 pieces @1740 kilos, described as used clothes” and received from Usman Industries. The items were noted to be liable to forfeiture and to have been seized on the grounds that: “they were not described accurately by the sender on a written declaration accompanying the consignment”.
On 19 August 2022, the Appellant requested the release of the items, stating that the items of clothing were used and not new. It also apologised on behalf of the suppliers “that value was noted incorrect and should have been in USD and not AED, the items are still a low value due to them still being used clothes and therefore do naturally have a low value. Please see attached invoice below”. The attached invoice was from Usman Industries dated 29 July 2022 and with invoice no. LU00080-22. The items were described as “used clothing”, 85 PKGS, 1740 in weight, and with a value of AED 1,305.
On 23 August 2022, the Respondent replied, treating the Appellant’s letter both as a challenge to the seizure and a request for restoration of the items. The Respondent stated that as part of the restoration process, it required proof that the Appellant owned the goods. The letter explained that “this should include proof that you have made payment for the goods, e.g. bank/credit card statements. Alternatively, if payment has not been made, please provide a copy of the contract showing the terms and conditions of payment, to include the invoice value of the goods.”
On 25 August 2022, the Appellant replied by email, repeating that the items had been wrongfully seized, that they were used clothing and that the clothes “are naturally low value items due to them being second hand and we price our items accordingly…”. The Appellant attached website listings, a page from a selling website listing “old skool streetwear”, a photograph of a market stall and receipts from Portobello Market. The email refers to the Appellant being a small business and its concern that it would be irreversibly damaged by being prevented to trade. The email ends with this:
“Finally, I have also attached the Invoice, packing list and confirmation letter of payment upon arrival provide by the shipper, Usman Industries. Unfortunately, there was no contractual agreement due to us having already having a working relationship with the shipper and we usually pay upon arrival unless agreed otherwise…”
The attached invoice from Usman Industries is again dated 29 July 2022, with invoice no. LU00080-22. The items were again described as “used clothing”, 85 PKGS, 1740 in weight. However, the items were now valued at USD 1,305. A breakdown of the items was also provided (2,835 pieces). The invoice was stamped and signed by Usman Industries.
This invoice was accompanied by a letter (undated) from Usman Industries which stated as follows: “As discussed, your payment of 1,305 USD for shipment of 124 boxes of used clothing will be once you receive goods at your ware house (as agreed delivery location)”. The letter was stamped and signed by Usman Industries.
On 22 September 2022, the Respondent considered whether to restore the items under section 152(b) of CEMA 1979 and declined to do so.
On 30 September 2022, the Appellant replied by email, stating that the Respondent had not examined the items properly. Photographs of various items that were individually packaged and tagged were provided. The email states that in regards to the goods being incorrectly entered and undervalued, that “this was an error on the shipment paperwork made by our supplier” and that there is a “significant language barrier between us and our supplier, Usman Industries”. The email further states that “we now understand they provided an incorrect invoice to this shipment. We have now requested a completely new invoice which accounts for the full cost of the goods and the prices of the different clothing categories….the invoice will still be paid to our supplier upon arrival.”
The further revised invoice from Usman Industries is again dated 29 July 2022 and has the invoice no. LU00080-22. The items were not described as new or used, but were now listed as “sweatshirts, jackets, trousers” etc., said to be 2,911 PKGS with a weight this time of 4,409.28 KG. The total value of the items was now stated to be GBP 36,000. The invoice was stamped and signed by Usman Industries.
The revised invoice was accompanied by another letter (undated) from Usman Industries which stated as follows: “As discussed, your payment of 36,000 GBP for a shipment of 85 boxes of used clothing will be when you receive the goods (at delivery location)”. The letter was stamped and signed by Usman Industries.
On 3 October 2022, the Respondent acknowledged the Appellant’s letter and treated it as a request to review the original decision.
On 10 November 2022, the Respondent reviewed the original decision and upheld the decision not to restore the items. The review officer was Officer Mark Collins. A summary of the restoration policy for seized items was contained in the review conclusion letter. It reads as follows:
“The general policy is that seized goods should not normally be restored. However, each case is examined on its merits to determine whether or not restoration may be offered exceptionally.”
Officer Collins’s reasons for deciding not to restore the items seized can be found under the “Consideration” section of the letter. He stated that in considering restoration, he had looked at all of the circumstances surrounding the seizure, but had not considered the legality or correctness of the seizure itself, which was subject to a separate challenge in the Magistrates’ Court. He had proceeded on the assumption that the Court would find that the seizure was lawful and would duly condemn the items as forfeit.
The letter goes on to state (under the heading “Consideration”) that the “onus of making your case rests firmly with you: it is not for Border Force to make the contrary case. I refer you to the judgment in the case of McGeown International…”. The letter then sets out a partial quote from McGeown International Ltd v HMRC [2011] UKFTT 407 (TC), as follows:
…it is the function of this Tribunal only to consider if HMRC have erred in law, or if they have taken a decision which is so unreasonable that no other Review Officer would have come to the same conclusion.
The burden of proof in relation to that question, very firmly rests with the Appellant. … the Appellant appeared to suggest that the onus of proving alleged unlawful activity rested with HMRC. That is simply not the case…HMRC were within their powers to seize the Vehicle. HMRC then have a very clear statutory discretion as to the terms on which a vehicle once seized may be restored (or not) and this appeal is only concerned with the examination of whether, on the facts, that discretion was properly exercised.”
The letter states that although McGeown International Ltd referred to the decision not to restore a freight vehicle, “the principle would clearly also apply to other goods.”
Officer Collins goes on to deal with the issue of ownership, as follows:
“Before I can further address the policy, the first hurdle that must be crossed is to establish ownership of the goods. In this regard I have inspected the documents tendered and the comments made. There are a number of invoices but there is nothing that actually shows you have paid for the goods. To reinforce this viewpoint, you have stated that the invoice will be paid to the supplier upon arrival of the goods. As the goods were seized by Border Force on the 2022-August-16 and remain in the possession of Border Force, it would therefore not appear that your company has ever paid for the goods.
Having examined the documents tendered and the comments made, I am not satisfied that ownership has been satisfactorily proven for any of the seized goods.
In this I refer you to the decision in the case of Worx Food and Beverage (TC/2013/04645) Judge Anne Redston concluded:
The UKBF’s case is equally straightforward. Before restoration can be considered, the customer has to prove ownership. That means providing evidence that the precise goods seized belong to the claimant. This is a reasonable measure, because otherwise the UKBF might restore goods to someone other than the owner. WFB have not shown that they own the precise goods which have been seized, because there is no way of linking the seized goods to the documents. Only OTN’s “bon de livraison” has any lot numbers, and these do not correlate to any goods in the Queen’s Warehouse. As a result, WFB have not discharged the burden of showing that they own the goods, and therefore the decision not to restore has to be reasonable.
And later in the same hearing:
We agree with Mr Hays. If ownership has not been established, then it is reasonable for the UKBF to stop there. They do not need to go on to consider whether the person claiming ownership was an innocent party in a fraudulent transaction.
And:
Again, we agree with Mr Hays. If a person has not proved that they own the goods in question, it is reasonable for the UKBF to stop there. Indeed, it would be unreasonable for them to go on to consider hardship, because that carries with it the inference that the goods were owned by the person asking for restoration.
We therefore find that the UKBF’s general policy of requiring proof of ownership is proportionate within the meaning of the Convention. We further find that it is proportionate in this case. The evidence provided by WFB in support of its claim to own the goods was inadequate, and Mr Collins’ decision to refuse to restore was proportionate.”
Having stated that he was not satisfied that the Appellant had proved ownership for any of the seized goods, Officer Collins states that, “even if you were to satisfactorily evidence ownership, I would further examine the facts of this case.” In that regard, the Officer refers to there being a number of invoices and documents for the same seized consignment. He notes that the entry lists the goods value as 296.16 AED (£67.21). There followed a series of invoices all numbered LU00080-22 and dated 29 July 2022 from Usman Industries, one describing the items as “used clothing” and another listing them as “shorts/trousers/jacket/puffer/t-shirt/sweatshirt/shirt”. The values listed for the items differed between the invoices (one had a value of 1,305 AED and another had a value of GBP 36,000).
The Officer notes that it is unclear why there are numerous different totals and declarations for the same consignment, but that, and the mis-description of the goods being used and not new, underpinned the reasoning behind the seizure, which would be examined at the Magistrates’ Court.
The Officer then stated that, “finally, I have read the reasoning behind your request for this review” but that “the issue that you have with the clothes not being new but in fact second hand is the reason behind the seizure…this is not something I can examine within my review but will form part of your appeal”.
In respect of the incorrect valuation and the Appellant apportioning blame on the supplier, the Officer quotes from Tkachenko v Director of Border Revenue [2017] UKFTT 0701 (TC), as follows (from [50] of the decision): “The Tribunal accepts that reliance on an agent, and ignorance of the law, are not a ‘reasonable excuse’ for failing to apply (sic) with the applicable UK customs requirements.”
This is immediately followed by the Officer stating that:
“To sum up, it does not appear you have paid for the goods and therefore I do not accept you have ownership of the items, nor do I consider you have demonstrated any exceptional circumstances that would lead me to vary the policy not to restore in this case.”
Under “Conclusion”, the Officer states that:
“I am satisfied that there are no exceptional circumstances in this case and am of the opinion that the application of this policy treats you no more harshly or leniently than anyone else in similar circumstances, and I can find no reason to vary the policy not to restore in this case.”
On 13 January 2023, the Appellant lodged a notice of appeal, together with detailed grounds of appeal. These grounds of appeal are summarised under these broad headings in the Appellant’s skeleton argument:
Ownership of the goods.
Extreme financial hardship on the part of the Appellant.
Exceptional circumstances.
Failure to consider appropriate conditions.
Failure to consider relevant circumstances.
The decision was disproportionate.
As stated above, the Appellant had initially also indicated an intention to challenge the seizure in the Magistrates’ Court under paragraph 3, Schedule 3 of CEMA 1979. However, on 2 March 2023, the Appellant stated that it wished to withdraw from those proceedings, with the result that on 31 March 2023, the items were condemned as forfeit.
the legal framework
Section 16(4) of the Finance Act 1994 (“FA 1994”) provides that the Tribunal’s power, when dealing with an appeal against a restoration decision, is limited to considering whether that decision “could not reasonably have been arrived at” by the relevant officer.
By section 139(1) CEMA 1979:“[a]ny thing liable to forfeiture under the customs and excise Acts may be seized or detained by any officer or constable...”
By section 167(1) CEMA 1979:
“If any person either knowingly or recklessly—
makes or signs, or causes to be made or signed, or delivers or causes to be delivered to the Commissioners or an officer, any declaration, notice, certificate or other document whatsoever; or
makes any statement in answer to any question put to him by an officer which he is required by or under any enactment to answer,
being a document or statement produced or made for any purpose of any assigned matter, which is untrue in any material particular, he shall be guilty of an offence under this subsection and may be detained; and any goods in relation to which the document or statement was made shall be liable to forfeiture.”
Section 152 CEMA 1979 provides that “the Commissioners may, as they see fit ... restore, subject to such conditions (if any) as they think proper, any thing forfeited or seized under [the customs and excise] Acts”.
On presentation of notice, the Commissioners are required by section 14(2) of FA 1994 to review “any decision under section 152(b) of the [1979] Act as to whether or not anything forfeited or seized ... is to be restored to any person or as to the conditions subject to which any such thing is so restored”.
On a review, the Commissioners may pursuant to section 15(1) of FA 1994 “confirm the decision” or “withdraw or vary the decision and take such further steps (if any) in consequence of the withdrawal or variation as they may consider appropriate”.
Where the Respondent refuses to restore goods, an appeal lies to the First-tier Tribunal by virtue of section 16(1) of FA 1994. The jurisdiction on appeal is limited to that in section 16(4) FA 1994, applicable to “ancillary matters”:
In relation to any decision as to an ancillary matter, or any decision on the review of such a decision, the powers of an appeal tribunal on an appeal under this section shall be confined to a power, where the tribunal are satisfied that the Commissioners or other person making that decision could not reasonably have arrived at it, to do one or more of the following, that is to say -
to direct that the decision, so far as it remains in force, is to cease to have effect from such time as the tribunal may direct;
to require the Commissioners to conduct, in accordance with the directions of the tribunal, a review or further review as appropriate of the original decision; and
in the case of a decision which has already been acted on or taken effect and cannot be remedied by a review or further review as appropriate, to declare the decision to have been unreasonable and to give directions to the Commissioners as to the steps to be taken for securing that repetitions of the unreasonableness do not occur when comparable circumstances arise in future.
With regard to the burden of proof, section 16(6) provides that: “it shall ... be for the appellant to show that the grounds on which any such appeal is brought have been established.” The position as to the burden of proof in respect of an appeal to the Tribunal in respect of the Respondent’s decision was summarised in McGeown International Limited v. Commissioners for H.M.R.C. [2011] UKFTT 407 (TC), at §45 and §46:
“Applying the principles, therefore, set out in [Associated Provincial Picture Houses Limited v. Wednesbury Corporation [1948] 1 K.B. 223], it is the function of this Tribunal only to consider if HMRC have erred in law, or if they have taken a decision which is so unreasonable that no other Review Officer would have come to the same conclusion.
“The burden of proof in relation to that question, very firmly rests with the Appellant. In the correspondence, the appeal notice (all of which are extensively quoted above) and in the Appeal, the Appellant appeared to suggest that the onus of proving alleged unlawful activity rested with HMRC. That is simply not the case.”
The burden is therefore on the Appellant to establish that the decision not to restore was unreasonable. A decision will be unreasonable if it is one which no reasonable decision maker could have arrived at it: C & E Commissioners v JH Corbitt (Numismatists) Ltd [1980] STC 23. A decision will also be unreasonable if the Respondent takes into account irrelevant matters, or fails to take into account all relevant matters: Lindsay v C&E Commissioners [2002] STC 588.
The Tribunal may consider evidence that was not before the decision maker and may reach factual conclusions based on that evidence: Gora v Customs and Excise Commissioners [2003] EWCA Civ 525 and Behzad Fuels (UK) Ltd v Revenue and customs Commissioners [2020] STC 760. In Gora, Pill LJ  accepted at [38] and [39] that the provisions of section 16 FA 1994 do not oust the power of the Tribunal to conduct a fact-finding exercise, with the consequence that it is open to the FTT on an appeal from a review decision to decide the primary facts and then determine whether, in the light of the facts it has found, the decision was one which could not reasonably have been reached.
The Tribunal has no jurisdiction, however, to review whether the seized items were properly seized and/or condemned as forfeit. The procedure for challenging the same must take place in the Magistrates’ Court. Where there is no successful challenge to the original seizure, there can be no argument that the items were incorrectly seized.
In Commissioners for HMRC. v. Jones and Jones [2011] EWCA Civ 824, the Court of Appeal held that once goods have been condemned as forfeit in the Magistrates’ Court, the Tribunal has no power to overturn that decision, but has to deem the goods to have been legally seized. Mummery LJ, giving the judgment of the court, held at [71]:
The stipulated statutory effect of the Respondents’ withdrawal of their notice of claim under paragraph 3 of Schedule 3 was that the goods were deemed by the express language of paragraph 5 to have been condemned and to have been ‘duly’ condemned as forfeited as illegally imported goods. The tribunal must give effect to the clear deeming provisions in the 1979 Act: it is impossible to read them in any other way than as requiring the goods to be taken as ‘duly condemned’ if the owner does not challenge the legality of the seizure in the allocated court by invoking and pursuing the appropriate procedure.
The deeming process limited the scope of the issues that the Respondents were entitled to ventilate in the FTT on their restoration appeal. The FTT had to take it that the goods had been ‘duly’ condemned as illegal imports. It was not open to it to conclude that the goods were legal imports illegally seized by HMRC by finding as a fact that they were being imported for own use. The role of the tribunal, as defined in the 1979 Act, does not extend to deciding as a fact that the goods were, as the Respondents argued in the tribunal, being imported legally for personal use. That issue could only be decided by the court. The FTT's jurisdiction is limited to hearing an appeal against a discretionary decision by HMRC not to restore the seized goods to the Respondents. In brief, the deemed effect of the Respondents' failure to contest condemnation of the goods by the court was that the goods were being illegally imported by the Respondents for commercial use.
At [71(7)], Mummery LJ further states that “deeming something to be the case carries with it any fact that forms part of the conclusion”.
Accordingly, in this case, the starting point is that the terms of section 167(1) (the basis for liability to forfeiture) are deemed to be true. It is not open to the Tribunal to go behind the deemed facts.
Worx Food & Beverage BV v The Director for Border Revenue (TC/2013/04645) is also pertinent. That was an appeal to the First-tier Tribunal (Judge Redston) against a decision not to restore goods (alcohol) which had been seized. Parts of the decision have been quoted in the review conclusion letter. The salient passages are these:
The UKBF’s case is equally straightforward. Before restoration can be considered, the customer has to prove ownership. That means providing evidence that the precise goods seized belong to the claimant. This is a reasonable measure, because otherwise the UKBF might restore goods to someone other than the owner…. As a result, WFB have not discharged the burden of showing that they own the goods, and therefore the decision not to restore has to be reasonable.
…
Our starting point is that the UKBF’s general policy of restoring goods only when satisfied that a person has proved ownership is self-evidently reasonable. The UKBF stores many thousands of items; it has to be a precondition of release that a person claiming a seized item must first show that it belongs to them.
…
Mr Hays gave short shrift to this submission, saying that since it was reasonable for Mr Collins to refuse to restore because ownership had not been proved, it was “irrelevant whether WFB was actually or constructively involved in the illegal importation of alcohol.” In other words, the UKBF did not need to go on to consider this question.
We agree with Mr Hays. If ownership has not been established, then it is reasonable for the UKBF to stop there. They do not need to go on to consider whether the person claiming ownership was an innocent party in a fraudulent transaction.
This Tribunal, likewise, does not need to consider the facts as found, to see whether they support Ms Hadfield’s submission that WFB was an innocent third party.
Ms Hadfield also submitted that the decision was unreasonable because the hardship caused to WFB had not been considered. Mr Hays says, with commendable brevity, that “no issue of hardship arose.”
Again, we agree with Mr Hays. If a person has not proved that they own the goods in question, it is reasonable for the UKBF to stop there. Indeed, it would be unreasonable for them to go on to consider hardship, because that carries with it the inference that the goods were owned by the person asking for restoration”.
A restoration decision involves an interference with the Article 1 Protocol 1 ECHR rights of an appellant who has been deprived of its goods. Such an interference must be proportionate, and must consider on an individual case whether the result is disproportionate. Judge Redston sets out the relevant principles in a convenient form in Smouha v The Director of Border Revenue (TC/2014/02680) at [136] – [146]. At [145] – [146], Judge Redston states thus:
Drawing this together, the Border Force must exercise their discretion proportionately as that term is understood both under EU law and under the Convention, and that a failure to do so will make the decision unreasonable. In considering our jurisdiction under FA94 s 16(4), we are therefore required to consider not only the traditional Wednesbury test but whether Mr Brenton exercised the discretion given to the Border Force in a proportionate manner.
We respectfully agree with the summary given by Sir Stephen Oliver QC in Yuan Shui v C&E Commrs [2004] C00187, where he said at [35] that:
“The power to restore in section 152(b) of the Customs and Excise Management Act 1979 is of an essentially discretionary nature. As such, the power must be exercised reasonably in the Corbitt sense and, following Lindsay, in a manner that produces a proportionate result. A decision satisfying those conditions will meet the requirements in Regulation 338/98 for an enforcement regime in the domestic laws of the Member state that operates in a manner that is sufficient and appropriate to the nature and gravity of the infringement. Moreover, if a way can be found of dealing with the request for restoration that is less invasive than a complete denial of the applicant's property rights, that should be adopted.”
the evidence
We have considered all the documentary evidence in the hearing bundle, including the witness statement of Mr King (on behalf of the Appellant), and the witness statements of Officer Zoe Boote and Officer Mark Collins (on behalf of the Respondent). Officer Boote, a Higher Officer of Border Force, currently employed as Review Officer, has adopted the witness statement and exhibits of Officer Collins, who is no longer with Border Force. Mr King and Officer Boote gave oral evidence. They were both cross-examined. We have reflected carefully upon their written and oral evidence.
As stated above, the Appellant bears the burden of establishing that the Respondent’s decision not to restore was unreasonable.
We note at the outset that the Respondent does not pursue a case of dishonesty on the part of the Appellant. All findings of fact have been made on the civil standard of proof (on the balance of probabilities). That means that they were reached on the basis that they are more likely to be true than not. We do not intend to address every point of evidence or resolve every contention made by the parties. We have made the findings necessary to resolve the appeal before us. Where findings have not been made, or have been made in less detail than the evidence presented, that reflects the extent to which those areas were relevant to the issues and the conclusions reached.
Mr King gave sworn evidence. We found him to be an essentially truthful witness. However, certain parts of his evidence were contradictory or muddled. For example, his witness statement states on more than one occasion that Usman Industries was the shipper or the shipping agent. At paragraph 23, for instance, Mr King states that the shipment “was handled by EdTex Stock’s shipping agents, Usman Industries”. In the Appellant’s email to the Respondent dated 25 August 2022, which had been sent by Mr King, he also referred to Usman Industries as “the shipper”.
However, in Mr King’s oral evidence, he stated for the first time that Usman Industries was in fact the supplier and that EdTex was more akin to being the shipping agent. When asked to elaborate, Mr King stated that Usman Industries was in fact supplying the items, and that EdTex was the “middle man” and was sorting out the deal. This was not apparent from Mr King’s statement, which made no mention of this. To the contrary, the impression given by the statement is that the Appellant was trading with EdTex who would be supplying the items, and that Usman Industries was the shipping agent.
We are also concerned to note that Mr King, on his own evidence, accepted that he did not bother checking the revised invoices supplied by Usman Industries. The fact that he did not do so is surprising, and reckless, particularly given that the revised invoices were being supplied to the Respondent as part of the Appellant’s request for restoration, and in the context of the import entry having incorrectly listed the value of the items as being just 296.16 AED (£67.21), and the Appellant being aware that the purchase price was £48,000 for all the items (of which the items seized formed a substantial part).
Mr King stated in his statement that the Appellant agreed with EdTex to purchase 3,860 items of clothing for the sum of £48,000 over four equal instalments (see [20]). He confirmed that the first shipment was received on 7 July 2022 and that had been paid for. In his oral evidence, he confirmed that £12,000 had been paid, but that the balance of £36,000 had yet to be paid. He also confirmed that the agreement was that the Appellant would pay for the balance on receipt of the remaining items. This aligns with the letters (undated) from Usman Industries, which states that payment would only be made when the Appellant received the goods (one of the letters  specifies that this would be “once you receive goods at your ware house (sic)”).
When cross-examined about ownership, Mr King refuted the suggestion that the Appellant was not the owner of the items as it had not taken possession of the items, and had not paid for them. He stated that he did not feel comfortable asking EdTex or Usman Industries to request restoration of the items, due to the alleged language barrier with Usman Industries and also because the Appellant believed that it was the owner of the items. When it was put to Mr King that English is the business language in the UAE and that there should not have been a language difficulty, Mr King repeated that personnel at Usman Industries were just not proficient in English.
Mr King was asked whether the Appellant had taken legal action against Usman Industries given the errors in misdescribing the items. Mr King stated that the Appellant had not pursued such legal action. He then stated that the Appellant was liable for payment of the items seized and that this was because of the “deal made”, that Usman Industries no longer had the items, and were expecting payment because of the deal.
Officer Boote also gave sworn evidence. We found her to be a truthful witness. She confirmed what she had stated in her witness statement that she had taken over the case from Officer Collins, who had left the department, and having reviewed the case, would have made the same decision as Officer Collins (to refuse restoration). When cross-examined, she accepted that when she took over the case, she was passed the file and Officer Collins had told her to read his decision. She stated that there were no notes/records of any of their conversations.
She stated that the legality of the seizure was not considered by Officer Collins (as is apparent from  review letter), or by her, given that the issue of the lawfulness or otherwise of the seizure was not within their remit, it being subject to separate proceedings in the Magistrates’ Court. She stated that the issue of ownership was considered by Officer Collins (as is apparent from  review letter) and was also considered by her.
Officer Boote accepted that she cannot confirm definitively what Officer Collins did or did not consider because he had left the department, and if he had not considered something, that would not necessarily be apparent from his review letter. She cannot confirm whether he considered or not the role of Usman Industries or Ed Tex.
The Respondent was criticised for not having produced its policy on restoration. Officer Boote stated that the Respondent had not done so, as it did not wish to the policy to be in the public domain due to concerns that smugglers would try to get around it. On the issue of ownership, Officer Boote stated that from the Respondent’s point of view, it would wish to see evidence of payment having been made by the Appellant for the items seized in order for it to establish ownership. She pointed out that according to Mr King’s own evidence, payment for the items seized had yet to be made. She also stated that Usman Industries could have requested restoration, with authority for the Appellant to act on its behalf if needed, and that would have been the obvious solution to take if the Appellant could not establish ownership (which she maintained it had not).
Officer Boote further stated that the Respondent had not requested an agent’s letter for the Appellant to act because neither Usman nor EdTex had requested restoration. She pointed out that the letter from Usman Industries explaining the supply process (them washing, packing and tagging the clothes) was not the same thing as a restoration request, and if Usman Industries had indeed written to request restoration, the Respondent would have asked for a signed letter of authority for the Appellant to act. However, no such restoration request was received from Usman Industries, or EdTex, despite them having had the opportunity to do so.
Officer Boote also refuted the suggestion that the letters from Usman Industries confirmed that the Appellant was owner of items seized. She repeated that the Appellant had not paid for the items seized.
Officer Boote accepted that the Respondent’s initial letter refusing restoration, dated 22 September 2022, did not refer to the issue of ownership at all. However, she pointed out that the Respondent had requested evidence of ownership of the items seized in their letter to the Appellant of 23 August 2022, in which the Respondent explains that as part of the restoration process, it required proof that the Appellant owned the goods. She also stated that the issue of ownership was mentioned in the review letter of Officer Collins.
Officer Boote was asked about the reference in the review letter to this quote from Tkachenko v Director of Border Revenue [2017] UKFTT 0701 (TC): “The Tribunal accepts that reliance on an agent, and ignorance of the law, are not a ‘reasonable excuse’ for failing to apply with the applicable UK customs requirements.”
However, it was put to her that Officer Boote had failed to quote the rest of that passage, which states as follows (at [50]):
“Nevertheless, the fact that the Appellant was a trader resident in Germany who traded in several different countries, whose first language was not English, and who paid for and relied in good faith on the services of a professional customs agent to ensure that the relevant formalities were complied with in the UK, a country into which he was importing for the first time, are all circumstances that are relevant to the question whether or not the goods should be restored, and if so, on what conditions.”
Officer Boote stated that she had not recently read this authority, but had read it in the past. When asked whether Officer Collins considered factors such as the lack of experience of Mr King and Mr Matthews, Officer Boote stated that she did not think that factor was relevant given that the Appellant was an enterprise. She stated that she herself did not consider the issue of reliance on an agent as quoted from Tkachenko and cannot be sure whether Mr Collins had. However, she repeated that when there is a commercial enterprise such as this, the Respondent would expect the enterprise or business to take all appropriate measures to comply with import regulations.
In response to the suggestion that agents exist because of the extraordinary complexity of the regulations, Officer Boote stated that it was not her place to answer that question. She maintained the view that there had been a massive under-declaration in this case, however, which would have caused the seizure of the items alone, and even if that was a genuine error, it should still not have happened.
It was put to her that given this was the first time the Appellant had items seized, there was no deliberate attempt to evade tax, and this was a careless error, an exception should have been made and the items restored. Officer Boote disagreed, stating that those at Usman Industries apparently could not even speak good English and yet the Appellant went into business with them. In her view, that was not appropriate or acceptable. She stated that even if ownership had not been in issue, the items would still have been seized due to the under-declaration.
It was put to her that the notice of seizure referred to the item not being described accurately by the sender and that was in reference to the items being “used clothes” . Officer Boote pointed out that the heading stated “notice of seizure for under-declared/ mis-declared goods”. She stated that these are not notices that are issued generically and that sometimes, the notice would simply say “notice of seizure”. When it was put to her that the grounds for seizure do not refer to under-declaration, she stated that it was subjective.
It was also put to her that there was an absence of proportionality in the Respondent’s decision not to restore. Officer Boote stated that proportionality would have been considered and she remained of the view that the items were not fit for restoration.
Discussion and findings
Under section 16(4) FA 1994, the Tribunal can only disturb the Respondent’s decision if the Tribunal is satisfied that the person making the decision could not reasonably have arrived at it. This condition will be satisfied if a decision is so unreasonable that no reasonable decision maker could have arrived at it. However, this condition will also be satisfied in other circumstances, including where the decision maker failed to have regard to relevant considerations, or had regard to irrelevant considerations, or based the decision on an incorrect understanding of the applicable legal provisions.
In making a decision of this kind, the decision maker is entitled to have regard to any applicable policy of the Respondent dealing with the manner in which the restoration power is normally to be exercised. Indeed, it would be unreasonable for a decision maker to fail to have regard to any such policy.
Where the Respondent has such a policy, and where the decision maker takes it into account in making the decision, the decision may also be one that could not reasonably have been arrived at in circumstances where the decision is based on an incorrect understanding of the terms of the policy.
The decision maker has a range of possible responses to a request for restoration. The Respondent could refuse restoration at all, or could restore upon payment of an amount representing a part, or the whole value of the seized items. The Respondent  has the ability to exercise the restoration power in a flexible way to treat more serious cases more severely, and less serious cases less severely, and rightly so, given that the Respondent must exercise its discretion in a proportionate manner.
Ownership of the items seized
The Respondent’s case is that establishing ownership of the items sought to be restored is a prerequisite condition for restoration. It submits that one cannot “restore” something to someone who does not own it. Further, in order to ensure property is not transferred to a non-owner, which might constitute conversion or some other impermissible interference with the property rights of the owner, it is reasonable for the Respondent to seek evidence that the person seeking restoration of the items is their owner. The Appellant’s own evidence is that payment would be made on receipt of the items. Whether property was to pass on delivery or payment of the seized items, neither occurred in this case.
The Respondent’s conclusion on review was that the Appellant had not established a necessary prerequisite condition for restoration, and that decision was not one no reasonable decision-maker could have arrived at. The burden on this appeal (and establishing ownership) rested on the Appellant.
The Appellant raises a number of issues with the Respondent’s contention that ownership should be a prerequisite condition, and that ownership had not been established on the facts of this case. They can be summarised as follows: (i) “ownership” is apparently an internal “policy” which the Respondent has deployed in this case; (ii) there is no consideration of whether on the facts of this case it was an appropriate starting point; and (iii) “ownership” being required when ownership is not a statutory requirement such that other forms of right to possession are sufficient.
In our view, the decision of Judge Redston in Worx Food, whilst not binding on us, is highly persuasive. We concur with Judge Redston that there is nothing unreasonable in a general policy of restoring seized goods to a person, only when satisfied that the person has proved ownership of the said goods. We find that this is a reasonable measure for the Respondent to have adopted, because it might otherwise restore goods to someone other than the owner, thereby inadvertently committing conversion (a tort) or some other impermissible interference with the property rights of the owner. It is proportionate and compliant with Article 1 Protocol 1 of the ECHR. In the absence of a policy of requiring proof of ownership, there would be a high risk that goods would be restored to persons other than their owners, so depriving those owners of their possessions.
The Appellant submits that “qualified ownership” or “qualified right to possession” of a seized item should suffice, and that at the very least the Appellant was a bailee. We do not agree. The question we have to decide is whether a general policy of restoring seized goods to a person, only when satisfied that the person has proved ownership of the said goods, is unreasonable. We have determined that there is nothing unreasonable in such a policy, particularly in a case such as this where it was open to either EdTex or Usman Industries (whoever the owner might be) to seek restoration, and if necessary, to grant authority to the Appellant to pursue restoration on its behalf.
The burden is on the Appellant to establish that it owns the seized items. We find that the Appellant has not established ownership. It was apparent from Mr King’s evidence that the contractual terms between the Appellant and its supplier were less than clear. What is clear is that the Appellant had agreed to pay £48,000 in four equal instalments to EdTex, and that payment for the items which were eventually seized would only be paid upon delivery of those items to the Appellant. The seized items were not delivered to the Appellant. It is also clear that the Appellant has not paid for the seized items. In our view, the evidence points away from the Appellant establishing ownership of the said items.
Furthermore, even if the Respondent should have considered qualified ownership or qualified right to possession of the seized items, the Appellant has not established that the items were bailed to it. The burden is on the Appellant to establish that it was in the position of bailee. In our view, it has not discharged that burden. Its reference to Bristol Airport PLC v Powdrill [1990] Ch 744 does not assist. That case involved airport operators seeking leave of the court under the Insolvency Act 1986 to exercise their right to detain an insolvent airline’s aircraft under the Civil Aviation Act 1982. It can be clearly distinguished from the present appeal.
The policy on restoration – exceptional circumstances
The discretion of the Respondent in relation to restoration decisions is given by section 152(b) CEMA 1979, which provided that the Respondent can “restore, subject to such conditions (if any) as they think proper, anything forfeited or seized…”. That is a broad discretion.
We have not been provided with a copy of the Respondent’s policy on restoration. It does not appear in the Respondent’s list of documents, provided pursuant to rule 27(1) of the Tribunal Procedure (FTT) (Tax Chamber) Rules 2009 (“the FTT Rules 2009”). Rule 27(1) states that in a standard or complex case, within 42 days after the date the respondent has sent its statement of case, each party must send to the Tribunal and to each part a list of documents –
of which the party providing the list has possession, the right to possession or the right to take copies; and
which the party providing the list intends to rely upon or produce in these proceedings.
The Respondent’s list of documents is dated 4 August 2023. It would have been open to the Appellant to request a copy of the Respondent’s policy on restoration upon receipt of the Respondent’s list of documents, or if necessary, apply for specific disclosure of the policy pursuant to rules 5 and 6 of the FTT Rules 2009 prior to the commencement of this hearing. As far as we are aware, no such request was made by the Appellant between receipt of the Respondent’s list and this hearing. There is also no application for specific disclosure. We have been invited to make adverse inferences against the Respondent. We decline to do so.
There was also no suggestion that the hearing should be adjourned in order for the policy to be produced. The Tribunal must therefore proceed on the basis of the information before it.
As stated above, the policy is summarised in the review conclusion letter as follows:
“The general policy is that seized goods should not normally be restored. However, each case is examined on its merits to determine whether or not restoration may be offered exceptionally.”
At the end of the letter, Officer Collins also states that he is satisfied “there are no exceptional circumstances” that would lead him to vary the policy not to restore.
The summary in the review conclusion letter differs slightly from the summary given in the first decision letter dated 22 September 2022, which reads as follows:
“The general policy is that seized goods because they did not correspond with the entry made and/or of an attempt to evade duty should not normally be restored, but each case is examined on its merits to determine whether or not restoration may be offered exceptionally.”
At the end of that letter, the same phraseology is used, with the officer stating that “there are no exceptional circumstances” justifying a departure from the policy.
Another summary, which differs from the two above, is set out in the notice of seizure itself, which reads as follows (the emphasis in bold is as per the notice):
“BF will consider all such requests on their individual merits and all relevant facts will be taken into account. However, normally it is BF policy not to return (restore) seized excise goods such as alcohol or tobacco products and goods prohibited from importation (for example drugs, offensive weapons and endangered species).”
The summary in the notice of seizure does not contain the word “exceptionally” or “exceptional”. The word “exceptionally” is also not in the wording of section 152(b) CEMA 1979, which confers on the Respondent a broad discretion in relation to restoration decisions.
Has the Respondent improperly fettered its broad discretion as set out in primary legislation by introducing the word “exceptionally” and “exceptional” into its policy, as contended by the Appellant?
The Respondent submits that the Appellant’s criticism in that regard is a misreading of the term “exceptionally” and “exceptional”. In his skeleton argument, counsel for the Respondent states that “exceptional” simply serves to indicate that there must be some justification that justifies a departure, and that the Appellant should be treated differently than an otherwise similarly-situated person. In other words, that an “exception” should be made.
The Oxford English Dictionary defines the word “exceptionally” as follows: (a) In an exceptional manner or degree; uncommonly, unusually, unusually well; and (b) By way of exception; as an exception to rule or custom. In our view, the Respondent’s contention would arguably fall within the second definition ((b)). Furthermore, given the wide discretion conferred on the Respondent in section 152,  we are inclined to take the view that it would be open to the Respondent to set a policy whereby restoration should not normally be restored, but that each case would be examined on its merits to determine whether or not restoration may be offered exceptionally.
In any event, it is not necessary in our view to conclusively determine this issue given our findings (a) that the Respondent’s policy of requiring a person to prove ownership of an item seized as a pre-requisite condition is not unreasonable; and (b) that the Appellant has not established ownership of the seized items. We agree with Judge Redston in Worx Foods that if ownership of a seized item has not been established, then it would be reasonable for UK Border Force to stop there and it would not need to consider other matters (such as whether the person claiming ownership was an innocent party, or matters of hardship). If ownership of a seized item has not been established, the ribunal, likewise, would be entitled to stop there.
However, we do wish to record this. It is regrettable that there are discrepancies in the summary provided by the Respondent as to its policy on restoration. The summary in the notice of seizure does not mention the word “exceptionally”, but that word appears in the two decision letters. The notice of seizure also suggests that the general policy is not to restore seized excise goods such as alcohol or tobacco products and goods prohibited from importation (for example drugs, offensive weapons and endangered species), which implies that it would not encompass other seized goods. This does not in any way affect our decision on this appeal. Nevertheless, these discrepancies should be addressed by the Respondent going forward so that it is reasonably clear to the public from the outset what, in summary, its policy on restoration is.
Other grounds
The Appellant raises other grounds in its appeal. It contends that the Respondent has failed to consider the alleged extreme financial hardship on the part of the Appellant, that the Respondent has failed to consider all relevant circumstances (which would include the alleged financial hardship), and that it failed to consider whether any appropriate conditions could be imposed so as to enable restoration.
It is clear from the Respondent’s skeleton argument dated 12 September 2024 that these grounds are not accepted. However, we agree with the Appellant that the Respondent has not pleaded any case in respect of these matters in its Statement of Case. We also agree that the Respondent has not addressed these matters in its initial decision letter, or in its review conclusion letter. Its position on these matters were not articulated until the production of its skeleton argument. It was then further fleshed out during the hearing when Officer Boote gave her evidence.
This brings us to the issue raised by the Appellant in its skeleton argument dated 23 September 2024 as to whether the Respondent should be prevented from advancing any case in respect of these matters. Rule 25 of the FTT Rules 2009 requires the Respondent to set out its position in relation to the case. Without restriction on its wide powers under rule 5 (case management powers), pursuant to rule 15(1), the Tribunal has the power to make directions as to the issues on which it requires evidence or submissions, the nature of the evidence or submissions it requires, and the time at which any evidence or submissions are to be provided. Pursuant to rule 15(2) the Tribunal can exclude evidence that would otherwise be admissible where (i) the evidence was not provided within the time allowed by a direction or a practice direction; (ii) the evidence was otherwise provided in a manner that did not comply with a direction or practice direction; or (iii) it would otherwise be unfair to admit the evidence.
We have concluded that it would not be fair and just to prevent the Respondent from advancing its case in respect of these further grounds. Whilst the issue was raised in its skeleton argument, which had been served slightly later than directed/agreed, the Appellant did not make an application prior to the hearing that HMRC should be precluded from advancing its case on these matters.
Furthermore, all the grounds of challenge have been fully ventilated at this hearing. For example, no objection was taken by the Appellant when the Respondent examined the witnesses on these further grounds of appeal. The Appellant had every opportunity to fully cross-examine the Respondent’s witness on these matters, and did so robustly. The Appellant has also had the Respondent’s skeleton argument, which sets out the Respondent’s case on these further grounds, for some weeks prior to the hearing. The Appellant has not been “ambushed”. No prejudice has been caused to the Appellant.
The appeal fails by reason of our findings that the Respondent’s policy of requiring a person to prove ownership of an item seized as a pre-requisite condition is not unreasonable, and that the Appellant has not established ownership of the seized items.  It is not necessary for the Tribunal to consider the further grounds. However, if the Appellant had established ownership (it has not), we would have been minded to conclude that the Respondent has not shown that it had taken into account the fact that this was a “first offence” for the Appellant (this was not disputed), that there was no dishonesty (no dishonesty having been pleaded), or that it had considered whether or not restoration could be made with appropriate conditions. Officer Boote did give oral evidence about these matters, but they were not dealt with in her witness statement or the witness statement of Officer Collins, or indeed, in the review conclusion letter. Whilst Officer Boote stated that she would still have reached the same conclusion (not to restore) given the counter-vailing factors, such as the Appellant entering into an arrangement with Usman Industries despite the alleged significant language barrier and the Appellant’s failure to check that the invoices were correct, those factors should have been specifically addressed in the review conclusion letter.
Conclusion
For the reasons set out above, we find that the Respondent’s decision not to restore was not one which a decision maker could not reasonably have arrived at. The appeal is dismissed.

HIS HONOUR JUDGE KEYSER KC
Judge Keyser KC :
Introduction
The claimant, Mr Howells, says that in August 2013 a hard drive containing the private key to his Bitcoin was deposited in error at Docksway Landfill Site, Newport, which is owned and operated by the defendant, Newport City Council.  He says that his Bitcoin are now worth in excess of £600 million and that, without the hard drive containing the private key, he is unable to access them.  By his claim issued on 17 May 2024 he contends that he is the owner of the hard drive and of everything on it, and he seeks declarations to that effect, an order that the defendant either deliver the hard drive or allow his team of experts to excavate the landfill in order to find it, and (in the alternative) compensation equivalent to the value of the Bitcoin that he can no longer access.
By an application notice dated 20 June 2024 the defendant has applied for an order striking out the claim on the grounds that the particulars of claim disclose no reasonable grounds for bringing the claim or are an abuse of process or likely to obstruct the just disposal of the proceedings; or, alternatively, summary judgment on the grounds that the claimant has no realistic prospect of success and there is no other compelling reason for the matter to be disposed of at trial.
This is my judgment on the application.  It is structured as follows.
Paragraphs 5 to 10 summarise the procedural law dealing with how the court approaches an application of this nature.
Paragraph 11 provides some background understanding of the issues in the case by quoting a short summary of how Bitcoin works.
Paragraphs 12 to 18 summarise the claimant’s claim and the facts on which he relies or which are not in dispute.
Paragraphs 19 to 54 contain the discussion of the issues.  The conclusion is in paragraph 55.
I am grateful to all counsel who contributed to the oral and written submissions on the application: for the defendant, Mr James Goudie KC and Miss Olivia Chaffin-Laird; for the claimant, Mr Dean Armstrong KC, Miss Maria Mulla and Mr Bruce Drummond.  It should be recorded that the claimant’s counsel and solicitors represented him at the hearing on a pro bono basis.
Strike-out and Summary Judgment: The Law
Strike-out: Part 3
CPR rule 3.4 provides in part:
The court may strike out a statement of case if it appears to the court –
that the statement of case discloses no reasonable grounds for bringing … the claim;
that the statement of case is an abuse of the court’s process or is otherwise likely to obstruct the just disposal of the proceedings; …”
CPR Part 3 is supplemented by Practice Direction 3A, which provides in part:
The following are examples of cases where the court may conclude that particulars of claim (whether contained in a claim form or filed separately) fall within rule 3.4(2)(a):
those which set out no facts indicating what the claim is about, for example ‘Money owed £5000’,
those which are incoherent and make no sense,
those which contain a coherent set of facts but those facts, even if true, do not disclose any legally recognisable claim against the defendant.
A claim may fall within rule 3.4(2)(b) where it is vexatious, scurrilous or obviously ill-founded.
…
A party may believe they can show without a trial that an opponent’s case has no real prospect of success on the facts, or that the case is bound to succeed or fail, as the case may be, because of a point of law (including the interpretation of a document).  In such a case the party concerned may make an application under rule 3.4 or apply for summary judgment under Part 24 (or both) as they think appropriate.”
Although the defendant has relied in the alternative both on r. 3.4(2)(a) and on r. 3.4(2)(b), the application has been advanced simply on the basis that the claim cannot succeed.  It is common ground that, when considering an application advanced on that basis, the court ought to assume that the facts relied on by the claimant are true: that is, the defendant’s contention is that, even if (which it does not necessarily accept) the facts alleged by the claimant are true, his claim must fail.
Summary judgment: Part 24
CPR rule 24.3 provides, so far as relevant to this application:
“The court may give summary judgment against a claimant … on the whole of a claim or on an issue if –
it considers that the party has no real prospect of succeeding on the claim … or issue; and
there is no other compelling reason why the case or issue should be disposed of at a trial.”
Many cases have explained the correct approach to applications for summary judgment.  The classic summary of the principles is that of Lewison J in EasyAir Ltd v Opal Telecom Ltd [2009] EWHC 339 (Ch) at [15], approved by the Court of Appeal in Global Asset Capital Inc v Aabar Block SARL [2017] EWCA Civ 37, [2017] 4 WLR 163.  Other significant summaries or discussions of the relevant principles include: ED&F Man Liquid Products Ltd v Patel [2003] EWCA Civ 472 at [8]–[10] (Potter LJ);; Elite Property Holdings Ltd v Barclays Bank Plc [2019] EWCA Civ 204 at [41]-[42] (Asplin LJ, dealing with the similar test for permitting amendment of a statement of case); Skatteforvaltningen v Solo Capital Partners LLP [2020] EWHC 1624 (Comm) at [3]-[4] (Andrew Baker J); Foglia v The Family Officer Ltd [2021] EWHC 650 (Comm) at [11]-[18] (Cockerill J); Lex Foundation v Citibank NA [2022] EWHC 1649 (Comm) at [33]-[39].  I have regard to what was said in these cases but do not need to set out the relevant dicta here.
For present purposes, I can summarise the position as follows.  Summary judgment will be given against a claimant on a claim or issue only if the court is satisfied that the claim or issue has no real, as opposed to fanciful, prospect of success; a claim or issue that is merely arguable but carries no degree of conviction will not have a real prospect of success.  The court will not conduct a mini-trial and, where necessary, will bear in mind that full disclosure has not yet taken place and that there might be more evidence to come.  Accordingly, where there are disputed questions of fact, it will not generally attempt to determine where the probabilities lie.  However, the court ought to carry out a critical examination of the available material and is not bound to accept the mere say-so of anybody; where it is clear that a factual case is self-contradictory or inherently incredible or where it is contradicted by the contemporaneous documents, the court, after careful consideration of the evidence that is currently before it and having regard to the nature of such further evidence as might reasonably be expected to be available at trial, is entitled to reject that case even on a summary basis.  The court will not be dissuaded from giving judgment by mere Micawberism—the unsubstantiated hope that “something might turn up”.  (I should record that the defendant in the present case does not invite the court, on this application, to question the factual basis of the claimant’s claim.)  Where the claim turns on a point of law that can properly be determined on the available evidence, the court is entitled to go ahead and determine it.  The complexity of litigation is not itself a reason for refusing summary judgment: the circumstances may be such that determination of the case is impossible without a trial; on the other hand, it might be possible to analyse the case sufficiently at an early stage and thereby avoid the unnecessary time and expense of the continuation of litigation until trial.  In all cases, r. 24.2(b) falls to be considered in principle.
How Bitcoin Works
In order to understand what this case is, and is not, about, some idea of how Bitcoin works is helpful.  For that purpose, I can cite the remarks of Birss LJ in Tulip Trading Limited v Van Der Laan [2023] EWCA Civ 83, [2023] 4 WLR 16, at [21]-[24].
In the bitcoin scheme transactions are recorded in a ledger or database known as a blockchain, with each network having its own ledger.  The blockchain constitutes a public registry recording every transaction.  A given amount of bitcoin is simply a number held at a certain digital address.  A transaction simply involves reducing the value at one address and correspondingly increasing it at another.  ... The amounts held at every address are public, but the identity of the parties is not.  The blockchain does not reveal the relationship between the digital addresses and any persons.
Each digital address is associated with a pair of public and private cryptographic keys.  The public key identifies the address on the network.  The relevant private key is the means by which bitcoin can be dealt with.  The holder of the private key uses it to cryptographically sign a record of the transaction moving bitcoin from one address to another.  The record is called a cryptographic hash.  The public/private key pair means that the person signing with the private key is proving that they are associated with the public key (and so the address), without revealing the private key itself.  The hash ensures that any attempt to alter the record would be noticeable, because even the smallest change would alter the hash.
For each network there are devices on the network that undertake ‘mining’.  This is the means whereby transactions are validated.  The latest transactions are gathered together into a block, which also includes a hash of the previous block (hence each block is chained to its predecessor, making a ‘blockchain’).  The miners work in competition with each other to produce an appropriate hash of this new block.  The competition is to find a unique ‘number used once’ or nonce, which causes the hash of the new block to have certain defined characteristics.  This is called a ‘proof of work’.  Blocks that have been validated this way are broadcast to the network and incorporated into further work.  Miners receive both transaction fees and new bitcoin.
The signing of the hashed transaction record with users’ private keys in the first place, and the incorporation of these records into a hashed chain of blocks produced by the proof of work, solves the double spending problem.  This characteristic of bitcoin does not emerge as a matter of law or convention, it is a characteristic which arises as a matter of fact from the way the software works.  As a result it is meaningful to describe bitcoin not merely as something which is transferable but as ‘rivalrous’ (see the Law Commission's recent Digital Assets: Consultation Paper [Law Com No 256]).  For a transferable thing to be rivalrous, the holding of it by one person necessarily prevents another from holding that very thing at the same time.  Because the holder cannot double spend their bitcoin, such that it is rivalrous, the cryptoasset can be said to be capable of assumption by a third party (see the definition of property in National Provincial Bank v Ainsworth [1965] 1 AC 65).  Thus, as Bryan J held in AA v Persons Unknown [2019] EWCH (Comm) 3556 (paragraphs 55-61) citing Ainsworth, a cryptoasset such as bitcoin is property.”
The Nature of the Claim
The defendant is the council for the city of Newport in South Wales.  With regard to the collection and disposal of waste, it is both a collection authority and a disposal authority for the purposes of the Control of Pollution Act 1974 (“CPA 1974”): see section 30(6).
Docksway Landfill Site (“the Site”) is a household waste recycling centre within the locality of the defendant council.  It incorporates a waste reception area and the landfill and is the main waste disposal facility for the whole of the city of Newport.  The evidence of Mr Mike Wallbank, the defendant’s Interim Head of Law and Standards, is that the landfill contains around 350,000 tonnes of waste with a further 50,000 tonnes added annually.  Once the skip at the reception area is full, the waste is emptied into the landfill, where it is then covered with inert material to minimise the release of gases or liquids and then compacted.
The Site is operated by the defendant under a permit issued by the Natural Resources Body for Wales (“NRW”) under regulation 13 of the Environmental Permitting (England and Wales) Regulations 2010
For the purposes of the application I assume the following facts, which are averred in the particulars of claim.  (Whether or not those facts are correct does not fall for my determination on this application.)  On 15 February 2009 the claimant ran Bitcoin software for the first time at his home in Newport, South Wales.  In early 2009 he was able to mine 8,000 Bitcoin, which “are currently located in their original wallet addresses” (particulars of claim, paragraph 9).  The Bitcoin software created a “wallet.dat” file for the claimant containing a public and private key address, which was saved on an internal laptop hard drive (“the Hard Drive”).  The private key, stored within the wallet.dat file, is the only information that can enable access to the claimant’s Bitcoin.  The Hard Drive was 2½ inches in size and black and silver in colour, and it had a white label, on which was black writing.  The Hard Drive was owned and in the possession of the claimant.  In 2010 the claimant placed the Hard Drive in a drawer located within his home office.  (In his evidence he explains why he removed it from the laptop.)  Thereafter he accessed the Hard Drive periodically, using a USB connector cable, because it contained not only the wallet.dat file but numerous other files, documents and photographs.  The Hard Drive was fully operational and accessible.  On 4 August 2013 the claimant had a clear-out from his home office, placing everything that he thought he did not need into two black bin-liner bags.  In his drawers he found two hard drives: one was the Hard Drive, and the other was a blank hard drive that contained no data.  He meant to throw out the blank hard drive, but instead he mistakenly picked up the Hard Drive and put it into one of the black bin-liners.  He then left the two bin bags downstairs in his house and asked his partner at the time to take them to the landfill at the Site the following day after completing the school run.  However, she said that she did not want to take the black bin bags to the Site and refused to do so.  The claimant was not overly concerned at her refusal, because he decided that on the following morning he would check to make sure that he had put the correct hard drive in the bin bags.  However, when he awoke at 9 o’clock the following morning he found that his partner had had a change of heart and had already taken the bin bags to the Site and manually deposited them into the general waste bins at the Site.  In October and November 2013 the value of Bitcoin rose sharply and the claimant’s holding increased in value to approximately £9 million.  (It is implied in the particulars of claim and expressly stated in his evidence that this increase in value of Bitcoin alerted the claimant to the need to check that he had indeed disposed of the correct hard drive.)  The claimant first met with a local representative of the defendant (Mr Gwyn Jones, the Operations Manager) on 25 November 2013 to discuss the question of access to the Hard Drive.  Thereafter he made repeated requests to the defendant for access to the Site in order to find and retrieve the Hard Drive, but these were largely ignored by the defendant.  The claimant then set about securing investment and expertise to enable a team of experts to undertake a landfill excavation and recovery operation and in 2023 he began to advance his case formally to the defendant.
In his particulars of claim, the claimant makes the following key averments:
The claimant was able to mine 8000 Bitcoin in early 2009 and has a complete record of the mining history which shows all block numbers and transaction identification.  The mined Bitcoin are currently located in their original wallet addresses [these are set out] and this can be evidenced by publicly available and independently verifiable blockchain data.
…
When running the Bitcoin Client software for the first time the software created a ‘wallet.dat’ file for the claimant containing a public and private key address which was saved on an internal 2.5 inch laptop hard drive (‘the hard drive’) at all times owned and in possession of the claimant.
…
The wallet.dat file is where the public and private key data is stored.  The private key (which is located inside the wallet.dat file) is the only information which can enable access to the claimant’s legally owned Bitcoin.
…
The claimant never intended to dispose of the hard drive.  The hard drive was taken from his home without his permission or consent on the morning of 2013-August-5.
…
With the hard drive containing the only wallet.dat key the claimant is unable to access his Bitcoin and is unable to transfer, or undertake any transactions with, his Bitcoin.  The claimant has access to the Bitcoin database and ledger where on any given day he can view the value of his digital property (the bitcoins).
Without the wallet.dat file contained on the hard drive the claimant is unable to access his Bitcoin.  There is no other way for him to access the Bitcoin without the wallet.dat file.
…
For the first time on 25 September 2023 the defendant asserted in writing to the legal representatives appointed by the claimant that, as the hard drive had been deposited at [the Site], they were the legal owners of the hard drive.
…
The claimant has been able to identify the precise location where the hard drive is placed within Cell 2 - Area 2 of Docks Way landfill site and has also established a recovery team who have set out in substantial detail in writing to the defendant, how the hard drive may be successfully recovered (at no cost, and at minimal risk to the defendant).
…
By asserting ownership of the hard drive, the defendant has substantially interfered with the claimant’s rights and has denied the claimant access to not only the tangible property of the hard drive, but additionally has deprived the claimant of his intangible property and his access to the same.”
On this application the claimant has produced evidence that he has assembled an expert team of recovery specialists, who consider that there is a good chance of locating and recovering the Hard Drive and of successfully using recovery technology to recover the private key even if the Hard Drive is damaged.  The defendant does not accept that this is so, and I make no findings as to whether it is so, but for the purposes of this application I shall assume the evidence to be correct.
The particulars of claim raise three heads of claim:
A proprietary restitutionary claim (paragraphs 46-50)
An equitable proprietary claim (paragraphs 51-54)
A claim for declarations that the claimant is the legal owner of the Hard Drive and all tangible and intangible property on it, together with either (a) an order for delivery up of the Hard Drive or (b) damages for its wrongful retention (paragraphs 55-58).
I shall comment on these heads of claim later in this judgment.
Discussion
This Case is not about Ownership of the Bitcoin
In my judgment, the only relevant issues in this case concern ownership of, and rights of access to, the Hard Drive.  It is necessary to make this clear at the outset, because at the hearing of the defendant’s application there was reference to rights regarding Bitcoin and intangible property.  I shall explain briefly why I consider those matters to be irrelevant to the real issues in the case.
The law of England and Wales has historically recognised two different kinds of personal property (Footnote: 1): things in possession (tangible property), and things in action (intangible property).  In broad terms, things in possession are physical things, and things in action are rights that have existence only as being enforceable within a legal system (such as debts that one is owed, or intellectual property rights).  It is now generally recognised that cryptocurrency, such as Bitcoin, is also property, although it does not fit within what the law recognises as tangible or intangible property; as such, it is commonly said to constitute, or to be within, a “third category” of personal property.  On this, see: Tulip Trading at [24] (paragraph 11 above); Law Commission, Digital Assets: Final report (Law Com No. 412, 2023), chapter 3; and the recent decision of Mr Richard Farnhill, sitting as a deputy High Court judge, in D’Aloia v Persons Unknown and others [2024] EWHC 2342 (Ch), especially at [104] and [173].
The only thing that went into the landfill was the Hard Drive.  The defendant has made remarks to the effect that this included all the intangible property on the Hard Drive (see, for example, paragraph 17 of the defendant’s skeleton argument).  That does not make good sense, in my view, because intangible property has no location and cannot be “on” anything tangible.  However, the remarks led Mr Armstrong KC for the claimant to mock the inference that, if the defendant is the owner of physical items in the landfill and of intangible property on those physical things, it is the owner of (for example) Microsoft’s intellectual property of programmes on any hard drive in the landfill.  The conclusion would, of course, be absurd; but the absurdity results from the notion that the intellectual property could be located on the hard drive.  (If a copy of the novel that won the Booker Prize in 2024 were thrown into the landfill, the author’s copyright would not go with it.)  In order to avoid going down blind alleys, one needs to focus on what property one is talking about.
The particulars of claim seek a declaration that the claimant is the legal owner of both the tangible and the intangible property of and in the Hard Drive (paragraph 56).  The tangible property is simply the Hard Drive, which is what went into the landfill.  Paragraph 58 of the particulars of claim identifies the intangible property on the Hard Drive as the Bitcoin, and in his oral submissions Mr Armstrong KC ended up contending that the Bitcoin were “on” the Hard Drive.  That is plainly wrong.  Bitcoin are not tangible property and cannot be on the Hard Drive or in the Landfill.  Bitcoin are also not intangible property (on this, see the helpful discussion in the Law Commission’s Digital Assets: Final report, at paragraphs 3.52 to 3.54), and neither intangible property nor property within the third category has physical location.  Mr Armstrong’s late contention is, in fact, contrary to the case advanced in the witness statement of the claimant’s solicitor, Mr Manley, which says in paragraph 33 that the Bitcoin “exist independently on the Blockchain, away from the hard drive”.
Anyway, the defendant has not asserted and does not assert that it is the owner of the Bitcoin.  It accepts that it does not own the Bitcoin and that (if it is true, as the claimant says, that he mined them and has not thereafter divested himself of them) the claimant is the owner of the Bitcoin.  Mr Goudie KC accepted unequivocally that this was so.  The defendant’s case is not that it owns the Bitcoin.  Its case is that it owns the Hard Drive and that the claimant has no right to have it or to gain access to it.  There simply is no issue between the parties about ownership of the Bitcoin.
What is on the Hard Drive is at most a digital record of the private key, which is a code provided to the claimant to enable him to operate his cryptocurrency account.  Mr Armstrong KC began by accepting in terms that the private key was information, not property.  In my judgment that is clearly correct.  (See the brief discussion in Bridge et al. eds., The Law of Personal Property, 3rd edition, at paras 10.44 to 10.46.)  But any question on the point would be immaterial.  The Hard Drive contains not the private key but a record of the private key.  The position is no different in principle from what it would be if the record of the private key had been written on a piece of paper that had been put into the landfill.  If the claimant had a separate record of the private key, he could use the private key to access the Bitcoin.  If the record that in fact exists is a digital file on the Hard Drive, it can indeed be said to be “on” the Hard Drive: a digital record, being mere information, must be embedded in a physical medium.  (That, I think, is what the defendant has meant in saying that it owns the Hard Drive and any intangible property on it.)  No doubt, the private key is confidential information and its use by others to gain access to the claimant’s cryptocurrency account would be unlawful.  (See, for example, the remarks of HHJ Pelling QC, sitting as a Judge of the High Court, in Fetch.AI Ltd v Persons Unknown [2021] EWHC 2254 (Comm), at [10].)  Mr Goudie KC again accepted that, if somehow the defendant were to gain knowledge of the private key, it could not use it to access the claimant’s Bitcoin account.  There is, again, no issue between the parties on this point.  Thus, even if it be arguable that the right to use the private key is capable of constituting property, the claimant’s case is not advanced, because the defendant does not claim such a right and the record of the private key on the Hard Drive in the landfill is different from a right to use the private key.  Mr Armstrong’s submission that, even if the defendant owns the Hard Drive, its refusal to deliver it to the claimant is a wrongful interference with his property rights is a non sequitur and without any proper basis in law.
The Hard Drive
The primary contention of the defendant is that, even if all the facts asserted by the claimant are true and correct, his claim cannot succeed, because the Hard Drive is the property of the defendant.
Section 12 of CPA 1974 imposes on each collection authority a duty to arrange for the collection of household waste in its area.  Section 14 imposes on each disposal authority a duty to arrange for the disposal of the waste collected by it in pursuance of section 12; and, for the purpose of the performance of that duty, it empowers each disposal authority to provide places at which to dispose of the waste, plant and equipment for processing or disposing of waste, and places at which to deposit waste before it is transferred to a place or plant and equipment for the sorting and processing of waste: section 14 (1), (3), (4).  Section 14 (6) provides (emphasis added):
A disposal authority or a collection authority may permit another person to use facilities provided by the authority in pursuance of the preceding provisions of this section and may provide for the use of another person any such facilities as the authority has power to provide in pursuance of those provisions; and—
subject to the following paragraph, it shall be the duty of the authority to make a reasonable charge in respect of the use by another person of the facilities unless the authority considers it appropriate not to make a charge;
no charge shall be made in pursuance of this subsection in respect of household waste; and
anything delivered to the authority by another person in the course of using the facilities shall belong to the authority and may be dealt with accordingly.”
What was delivered to the landfill was the Hard Drive.  The defendant’s simple contention is this: it is the claimant’s case that the Hard Drive was delivered to the Site by “another person”, namely his partner at the time; she delivered it “in the course of using the facilities”; and, in those circumstances, the Hard Drive belongs to the defendant and the claimant is not entitled to it.
In my judgment, the defendant’s argument is correct and provides a complete answer to the claim.
Several arguments in response were advanced on behalf of the claimant.  Before addressing them, I observe that a thread running through the submissions to me on behalf of the claimant was that the case concerns an area of law that is complex, uncertain and developing and that accordingly it is unsuited to a summary determination.  However, even if the area of law has the features attributed to it by the claimant, this is not enough to justify permitting the case to proceed if in truth there is no reasonable basis for advancing the claim or no realistic prospect that the claim will succeed: see, in a slightly different procedural context, the observations in Tulip Trading at [63] and [68].  Another submission, made by Miss Mulla, was that the case is unsuitable for summary disposal because there are many (she listed nineteen) issues of fact that could only be resolved at trial.  Again, however, the existence of factual issues does not prevent summary disposal if it is possible to say that, however the issues might be decided, there is no reasonable basis for bringing the claim or the claim has no realistic prospect of success.
I turn to consider the arguments advanced on behalf of the claimant in respect of CPA 1974.  First, it was submitted: “‘Belong’ is not a term of legalese.  It is necessarily a factual term” (skeleton argument, paragraph 51.2).  Quite what this means is unclear.  It is true that legal usage will commonly use the language of “property” rather than of belonging.  But “belong” is a normal English word and I do not know why it should be thought have a “factual” rather than a legal import or what the difference might be.  Indeed, Mr Armstrong KC himself drew attention to a well-known example of the legal use of the language of belonging, namely section 1 of the Theft Act 1968 (“property belonging to another”).
Second, it was submitted that section 14(6)(c) merely says that anything so delivered shall belong to the authority but does not say that it shall cease to belong to its former owner: that is, it does not preclude the possibility that existing property rights might be preserved, or that a thing might “belong” to a number of individuals concurrently.  I was referred to section 5 of the Theft Act 1968, which explains what is meant by property “belonging to another” in that Act:
Property shall be regarded as belonging to any person having possession or control of it, or having in it any proprietary right or interest (not being an equitable interest arising only from an agreement to transfer or grant an interest).
Where property is subject to a trust, the persons to whom it belongs shall be regarded as including any person having a right to enforce the trust, and an intention to defeat the trust shall be regarded accordingly as an intention to deprive of the property any person having that right.
Where a person receives property from or on account of another, and is under an obligation to the other to retain and deal with that property or its proceeds in a particular way, the property or proceeds shall be regarded (as against him) as belonging to the other.
Where a person gets property by another’s mistake, and is under an obligation to make restoration (in whole or in part) of the property or its proceeds or of the value thereof, then to the extent of that obligation the property or proceeds shall be regarded (as against him) as belonging to the person entitled to restoration, and an intention not to make restoration shall be regarded accordingly as an intention to deprive that person of the property or proceeds.
Property of a corporation sole shall be regarded as belonging to the corporation notwithstanding a vacancy in the corporation.”
Section 5 of the Theft Act 1968 illustrates that it is possible to speak of property belonging to more than one person at the same time.  This, however, does not take matters much further.  The question is how the words are used in a particular context.  Thus, for the purpose of explaining what was meant by the theft of “property belonging to another”, section 5 of the Theft Act 1968 extended the concept to almost any proprietary interest and, possibly, even beyond: see section 5(4).  That represents a clear legislative decision with an obvious purpose.  In my judgment, the position is quite different in respect of section 14(6)(c) of CPA 1974.  First, there is no reservation, or recognition of the existence, of other rights in the things delivered.  Second, the words “shall belong to the authority” are unqualified and unrestricted: it is not said, for example, that the authority shall have a possessory or other proprietary right in the things delivered.  Third, and correspondingly, the words “and may be dealt with accordingly” are important.  If other persons are supposed to retain proprietary rights or interest in the things delivered, what (one may ask) could it mean to tell the authority that it may deal with the things “accordingly”?  According to what?  According to proprietary rights that are limited or qualified by co-existing or competing or superior rights?  The words “and may be dealt with accordingly” confer a practical right: to put it rather colloquially, they tell the authority, in effect, “They are yours and you may do with them as you wish.”  Fourth, this is consistent with the context of the provision, namely the processing and disposal of waste by the disposal authority.  It would be impractical for a disposal authority to be concerned with the possible existence of competing proprietary interests in the deposited waste.  In theory it would be possible for such interests to exist but for the disposal authority to be empowered to deal with the waste in disregard of those interests.  But one has only to identify that possibility to see that, as a construction of section 14(6)(c), it is not only unnecessary but absurd: any qualification of the words “shall belong to the authority” would be contrary to the point of the provision; therefore it makes no sense to introduce such a qualification into the interpretation of the words.
Third, it was submitted that it is arguable that the words “in the course of using the facilities” in section 14(6)(c) do not apply to someone, such as (allegedly) the claimant’s partner at the time, who disposes of items without the owner’s consent.  I do not regard the point as arguable at all.  Whether or not the claimant’s partner had his authority to take the bags to the Site and dispose of them there (and it is far from clear to me that she did not have such authority), she was using the facilities.  The statutory provision does not distinguish among users of the facilities on the basis of their authority, just as it does not distinguish among them on the basis of their state of mind. (So, if the claimant had himself taken the bags to the Site, he would have been “using the facilities”, regardless of whether he was delivering the Hard Drive by mistake.)  There is no proper basis for implying any limitation into the words of the provision, and there is every reason for not doing so, because the disposal authority’s freedom to deal with items delivered to it as refuse cannot sensibly be contingent on things of which it has no knowledge or control.
In conclusion, therefore, I consider that the defendant’s argument based on section 14(6)(c) is a sufficient answer to the claim.
In the light of that conclusion, I shall comment fairly briefly on the particular ways in which the claimant’s claim has been advanced (see paragraph 18 above).  I should note, however, that the argument before me contained very little analysis of precisely how the claimant’s claim might arise; only the broad contours were apparent.
Legal Ownership of the Hard Drive
This head of claim, set out in paragraphs 55 to 58 of the particulars of claim, lies at the heart of the case.  The claimant says that the Hard Drive (together with everything on it) is his; therefore, the defendant must either deliver it up to him or give him the opportunity to recover it or pay him damages for depriving him of it.  Those damages are claimed in an amount equivalent to the value of the Bitcoin, which is said currently to exceed £600 million.
Section 14(6)(c) of CPA 1974 is a complete answer to this head of claim.  In the circumstances, and as I did not receive any argument at the hearing in respect of issues concerning wrongful interference with goods, I shall say no more on the point.
The Proprietary Restitutionary Claim
In correspondence, those acting for the claimant have relied on the decision of Mr Stephen Morris QC sitting as a deputy High Court judge in Armstrong DLW GmbH v Winnington Networks Ltd [2012] EWHC 10 (Ch), [2012] 3 WLR 835 (“Armstrong”) in support of the proprietary restitutionary claim, and was one of the authorities put before me, though it was referred to only in passing at the hearing.  The case concerned certain tradeable EU allowances (“EUAs”) credited to operators under the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme.  The EUAs were entirely electronic and were treated in the case as being a form of intangible property.  The claimant, an operator of power plants that emitted carbon dioxide and were therefore within the Scheme, held EUAs in its accounts under the Scheme.  An unknown third party committed a fraud that resulted in a large number of the claimant’s EUAs being transferred to the account of the defendant, which was a legitimate trader in EUAs.  The defendant immediately sold the EUAs to a regular customer.  The claimant made three alternative claims against the defendant: first, a claim for restitution on the grounds of unjust enrichment (that is, to recover from the defendant a sum equal to the amount by which the defendant had been unjustly enriched by receipt of the EUAs or the proceeds of their sale); second, a proprietary restitutionary claim; third, a personal claim in equity for “knowing receipt”, on the grounds that the fraudster had held the EUAs on constructive trust for the claimant and that the state of the defendant’s knowledge was such as to render its receipt of the EUAs unconscionable, so that it in turn had held them on constructive trust for the claimant.  The claim for restitution on the grounds of unjust enrichment failed: see [95]-[98].  The proprietary restitutionary claim also failed, because the deputy judge held that the fraudster had acquired legal title to the EUAs, which therefore had become subject of a constructive trust.  Correspondingly, the claim for equitable compensation for knowing receipt of trust property succeeded.
In the present case, the claimant does not rely on an allegation of “knowing receipt”, and no claim is advanced for restitution on the grounds of unjust enrichment.  However, the claimant does apparently maintain a proprietary restitutionary claim.  I regard that claim as misguided for reasons quite apart from the fact that it is precluded by section 14(6)(c) of CPA 1974.
In Armstrong, the proprietary restitutionary claim was described as a personal claim to vindicate the claimant’s continuing legal title to the EUAs or their substitutes in the hands of the defendant: see [33].  It was “based on the notion that the claimant has, at all times, retained legal title to the relevant asset, which asset has been transferred away from the claimant and it (or its substitute) has found its way into the hands of the defendant.  Here the claimant can claim restitution of value from the indirect recipient of the asset”: see [63].  Having discussed at length a number of leading cases, the deputy judge stated his conclusion on the law as follows:
In my judgment, on the current state of the authorities and in particular the three leading cases referred to above, there is a basis of claim which can conveniently be labelled a ‘proprietary restitutionary claim’ which is distinct from a claim for restitution on grounds of unjust enrichment. …
The essence of such a claim at common law is that the claimant is seeking to enforce his subsisting legal property rights in an asset held by the defendant.  The asset in respect of which the claimant is asserting a claim may be identified by ‘following’ the claimant’s original asset into the defendant’s hands or by ‘tracing’ it into a substitute asset in the defendant’s hands. …
This type of claim does not arise where the relevant asset is a chattel or land or even a documentary intangible, because there are other distinct causes of action in tort covering these types of property.  It does arise where the asset in the hands of the defendant is money (possibly, under the old common law action for money had and received).
…
Finally, the fact that there can be no claim in conversion in respect of choses in action or other intangibles does not mean that there can be no proprietary restitutionary claim in respect of choses in action or other intangibles.  Conversion is a strict liability tort with no room for defences of bona fide purchase.  That is not the position with a proprietary restitutionary claim. … There is no reason why the law should provide protection for land, chattels, documentary intangibles and money but not for other intangibles.
In my judgment, as a matter of authority and principle, if and where legal title remains with the claimant, a proprietary restitutionary claim at common law is available in respect of receipt by the defendant of a chose in action or other intangible property.”
I proceed on the assumption that both the decision and the reasoning in Armstrong are good in law, though both have proved a little controversial.  Nevertheless, the case does not support the claimant’s claim in the present case.  First, the requirement that the claimant have subsisting property rights in an asset held by the defendant cannot be satisfied, by reason of section 14(6)(c) of CPA 1974.  Second, the proprietary restitutionary claim was a common law claim based on the retention of legal title (not a claim in equity), and the remedy is not available where the asset is a chattel, as is the Hard Drive: see [63], [85] and [86].  Issues concerning the legal ownership of things in possession (tangible assets) are not dealt with at common law by anything akin to the vindicatio of Roman Law but rather by the law of torts, in particular the tort of trespass (direct interference with goods) and the tort of conversion.  If, on the other hand, the proprietary interest is said to be equitable, the matter falls to be analysed in terms of “knowing receipt” (rightly not relied on in this case) or constructive trust (for which, see the following paragraphs).
The Equitable Proprietary Claim
In the particulars of claim (paragraphs 51 to 54) the claimant advances what he calls an “equitable proprietary claim”.  The formulation of the claim is not entirely clear: in paragraph 51 it is put on the basis that, if the defendant is indeed the legal owner of the Hard Drive, it is the constructive trustee for the claimant of “the intangible property contained on the hard drive including the wallet.dat file providing the key to the Bitcoin”; however, paragraphs 52 to 54 aver that the defendant holds the Hard Drive itself on constructive trust for the claimant.  Anyway, the gist of the argument is that, if indeed the legal ownership in the property (namely, as explained above, the Hard Drive) has passed to the defendant, the claimant nevertheless has an equitable interest in the property under a constructive trust.
Any such equitable interest would have had to be newly created, for the reason given by Lord Browne-Wilkinson in Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale v Islington LBC [1996] A.C. 669 at 706:
“A person solely entitled to the full beneficial ownership of money or property, both at law and in equity, does not enjoy an equitable interest in that property.  The legal title carries with it all rights.  Unless and until there is a separation of the legal and equitable estates, there is no separate equitable interest.”
Lord Browne-Wilkinson summarised the relevant principles of trusts law at 705:
Equity operates on the conscience of the owner of the legal interest.  In the case of a trust, the conscience of the legal owner requires him to carry out the purposes for which the property was vested in him (express or implied trust) or which the law imposes on him by reason of his unconscionable conduct (constructive trust).
Since the equitable jurisdiction to enforce trusts depends upon the conscience of the holder of the legal interest being affected, he cannot be a trustee of the property if and so long as he is ignorant of the facts alleged to affect his conscience, i.e. until he is aware that he is intended to hold the property for the benefit of others in the case of an express or implied trust, or, in the case of a constructive trust, of the factors which are alleged to affect his conscience.
In order to establish a trust there must be identifiable trust property. The only apparent exception to this rule is a constructive trust imposed on a person who dishonestly assists in a breach of trust who may come under fiduciary duties even if he does not receive identifiable trust property.
Once a trust is established, as from the date of its establishment the beneficiary has, in equity, a proprietary interest in the trust property, which proprietary interest will be enforceable in equity against any subsequent holder of the property (whether the original property or substituted property into which it can be traced) other than a purchaser for value of the legal interest without notice.”
In argument before me, the possibility of a resulting trust was mooted, though it does not form part of the pleaded case.  The contention that a resulting trust could have arisen seems to me to be impossible to maintain.  The case does not fall within the recognised circumstances in which a resulting trust can arise.  See the remarks of Lord Browne-Wilkinson in Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale at 708-709 and 715-716.
The claimant’s case on constructive trust was not developed before me in any detail.  One might almost, uncharitably, have supposed that it was desired to leave the judge none the wiser and so unwilling to form any firm view on a summary basis.  Miss Mulla’s primary submission was that the existence of a trust would require analysis of the factual circumstances and that this could not be performed without a trial.    However, a claimant faced with an application for summary determination has at least to show that there is a claim capable of coherent formulation and with a realistic prospect of success.  So I have tried to understand the case on constructive trust as best I can.  The case, as I understand it, is that, if indeed the defendant is the legal owner of the Hard Drive, it held the Hard Drive on trust for the claimant since it learned, in November 2013, that it had received the Hard Drive without the knowledge or consent of the claimant, because he did not know of its disposal, and so holds it on trust for him.  This form of trust was considered by Lord Browne-Wilkinson in Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale, in the context of a discussion of Chase Manhattan Bank N.A v Israel-British Bank (London) Ltd [1981] Ch 105, a case concerning the receipt of money paid under a mistake.  He said at [1996] A.C. 669, 715:
“The defendant bank knew of the mistake made by the paying bank within two days of the receipt of the moneys … [This fact] may well provide a proper foundation for the decision.  Although the mere receipt of moneys, in ignorance of the mistake, gives rise to no trust, the retention of the moneys after the recipient bank learned of the mistake may well have given rise to a constructive trust”.
A claim based on such a trust would, in my judgment, have no realistic prospect of success in the present case.  First, the existence of the necessary equitable interest on the part of the claimant is precluded by section 14(6)(c) of CPA 1974, as already explained.  This is the critical point, because it rules out any trusts claim, however formulated.
Second, the trust is based on unconscionable retention of property.  In my view there would be no realistic prospect of a finding that the defendant’s retention of the Hard Drive was unconscionable.  The defendant was not retaining it for gain or because it wanted it.  It was retaining it because it was buried in landfill.  Even by 25 November 2013, when the claimant explained the position to the defendant’s officer, Mr Gwyn Jones, at the Site, the Hard Drive was buried and the claimant was able only to identify “which area approximately within the Newport Landfill site the hard drive ha[d] been buried in”: see paragraphs 56 and 57 of the claimant’s witness statement dated 31 March 2024.  The claimant has adduced a report prepared for him in March 2021 by Mr Gwyn Jones, according to which in November 2013 the Hard Drive was “probably” located “within an area of approximately 2,000 square metres of the site” and “within an approximate volume of 10,000 – 15,000 tonnes of waste.”  It would be a criminal offence for the claimant or anyone acting for him to sort over or disturb any refuse deposited at the Site, unless he were authorised to do so by the defendant: see section 27 of CPA 1974 and section 60 of the Environmental Protection Act 1990.  The defendant could only give such authorisation, or excavate the Site itself, if it were first to apply for and obtain a new environmental permit from NRW, as the Schedule of permitted activities in its existing permit does not allow excavation of the Site.  The defendant has refused to give authorisation or to apply for a new environmental permit so as to give itself power lawfully to give such authorisation or excavate the Site itself.  No challenge to that refusal by way of a claim for judicial review has ever been brought, and such a claim would now be well out of time.  In any event, it is fanciful to suppose that the refusal of the defendant to permit disturbance and excavation of the landfill would be held to be unconscionable.  For one thing, as already mentioned, there are obvious practical reasons for declining to permit such activities—even if, as the claimant asserts, they could be successfully carried out.  But the matter goes further.  The case is nothing like the typical case where the property in question is, for example, money sitting in a bank account or a car sitting in a garage, either of which might be readily restored.  Here the asset (the Hard Drive) is both within land of which the defendant is in possession and buried under an amount of material of which the defendant is the owner.  It did not get into that position by reason of any wrongdoing on the part of the defendant.  I see no reasonable basis on which the claimant could assert an entitlement either (i) to require the defendant to excavate its own land to recover his Hard Drive—which, for obvious reasons, is not actually what he is seeking—or (ii) to enter himself onto the defendant’s land and interfere with the defendant’s property.  In the course of oral argument, Mr Armstrong KC suggested that the matter would turn on a balance of competing interests.  While that has obvious attraction for the claimant, when the balance is said to be on the one hand a Hard Drive giving access to hugely valuable Bitcoin and on the other hand a pile of rubbish, such a balance has no basis in property law.  This seems to me to undermine any claim for delivery of the Hard Drive; more particularly, it undermines the contention that the retention of the Hard Drive in the landfill could be unconscionable.
Third, the claimant knew the facts material to his claim by November 2013 but did not commence proceedings until May 2024.  In those circumstances, in my judgment, his claim is barred by lapse of time.  Section 21 of the Limitation Act 1980 provides in relevant part:
No period of limitation prescribed by this Act shall apply to an action by a beneficiary under a trust, being an action—
…
to recover from the trustee trust property or the proceeds of trust property in the possession of the trustee, or previously received by the trustee and converted to his own use.
…
Subject to the preceding provisions of this section, an action by a beneficiary to recover trust property or in respect of any breach of trust, not being an action for which a period of limitation is prescribed by any other provision of this Act, shall not be brought after the expiration of six years from the date on which the cause of action accrued.”
In view of the terms of section 21(1)(b), section 21(3) does not apply to an action to recover trust property from a trustee; no limitation period applies to such a claim.  However, not all constructive trusts fall within section 21.  Lewin on Trusts (20th edition), para 50-056, explains the distinction between two kinds of constructive trust (references omitted):
“The first comprises those cases in which a defendant has assumed the duties of a trustee or other fiduciary, doing so by a transaction which was independent of and preceded the breach of trust complained of, e.g. where the defendant acts as a trustee de son tort or agrees to buy land for a claimant but then seeks to keep it for himself; the second comprises those cases in which the so-called trust obligation arises as a direct consequence of an unlawful transaction which the claimant impugns and in which the defendant is no more than a wrongdoer, e.g. where the defendant dishonestly assists the trustee in a breach of trust or obtains property from the claimant by fraudulent misrepresentation.  The former, called in this section constructive trusts of the first kind, are true trusts, for the defendant has assumed a fiduciary duty.  The latter, called in this section constructive trusts of the second kind, are not true trusts, for the defendant has never assumed any fiduciary duty; they are purely remedial and are described as constructive trusts merely as ‘a formula for equitable relief’.”
The only kind of constructive trust that could possibly be alleged in the present case is a constructive trust of the second kind.  In Williams v Central Bank of Nigeria [2014] UKSC 10, [2014] AC 1189, the Supreme Court confirmed that constructive trusts of the second kind fall under section 21(3), not under section 21(1), and that a claim by a beneficiary under such a trust to recover trust property or in respect of a breach of trust is subject to a six-year limitation period.  Accordingly, I reject the claimant’s contention that his claim under a constructive trust would be subject to no limitation period.  The claimant’s fall-back position, as I understand it, is that the cause of action accrued only when the defendant asserted ownership of the Hard Drive in its letter dated 25 September 2023: see paragraph 46.2 of his skeleton argument.  The problem with that, as it seems to me, is that the constructive trust (if any) would have arisen upon the unconscionable retention of the trust property, and on the claimant’s case the defendant had the requisite knowledge in 2013 but did not give him access to recover his property.  As the trust in question arises from unconscionable retention of the property, it is not the terms of correspondence in 2023 that give rise to any cause of action.  If the claimant were to attempt to evade this conclusion by saying that no trust arose until, at a much later date, he demonstrated to the defendant the feasibility of a recovery operation, the untenable nature of his contention that any trust at all existed would only be thrown into higher relief.
An argument was advanced on behalf of the claimant in reliance on section 32 of the Limitation Act 1980: that it was arguable that the defendant had deliberately concealed a fact relevant to his right of action (namely, the fact of its assertion of ownership of the Hard Drive) and that the period of limitation did not begin to run until he discovered that concealment upon receipt of the defendant’s letter dated 25 September 2023.  I regard this as a desperate argument.  The claimant knew what had happened to the Hard Drive for a full ten years.  The defendant concealed nothing.  If it first asserted ownership of the Hard Drive, in reliance on CPA 1974, in September 2023, that was an assertion of law, not of fact.  If the assertion itself be regarded as a fact, it had not been concealed because it had not previously been made.  Anyway, as the supposed constructive trust rests on unconscionable retention of the property, it is not the assertion that founds the right of action.  (If A receives B’s money in circumstances that make his retention of it unconscionable but refuses to return it, nothing is added if at some later date A adds, “It’s mine.”)
If, however, the claimant were correct in the contention that no statutory limitation period applies to the claim, I would not accede to the defendant’s invitation to conclude at this stage that the claim would be barred by the equitable doctrine of laches.  In P&O Nedlloyd B.V. v Arab Metals Co and others, Moore-Bick J said at [52], “The equitable doctrine of laches … provides the court with ample power to refuse relief when delay on the claimant’s part would make it inequitable to grant it”.  At [61] he said: “The question for the court in each case is simply whether, having regard to the delay, its extent, the reasons for it and its consequences, it would be inequitable to grant the claimant the relief he seeks.”  I would not be willing to hold on a summary basis that laches would provide an unanswerable defence to the claim.  In particular, the consequences of delay are unclear, in circumstances where it is not certain on the evidence before me how much harder any excavation and recovery operation would be by reason of the lapse of time.
Other compelling reason for trial
As I do not consider that the present claim has any realistic prospect of success, it is necessary to consider whether there is any other compelling reason for the claim to be disposed of at trial rather than summarily.  In my judgment, there is not.  On behalf of the claimant, it has been submitted that there are a great many facts which could only be investigated at trial; however, even if that is so, findings as to any disputed facts are not required for the resolution of the case at this stage.  Again, much was made on behalf of the claimant of his offer to give to the city of Newport 10% of the value he realises from his Bitcoin in the event that he recovers the Hard Drive and the private key.  It was submitted that “the very fact that the claimant has pledged 10% of the value of the Bitcoin to the community of Newport dictates that the public are also entitled to have these matters fully adjudicated openly” (skeleton argument, paragraph 16).  I do not regard this as a compelling reason why the case should be disposed of at trial.  The claimant cannot compel the defendant to accept his offer.  If he has no legally sustainable case, disposal at a trial will be fruitless for him and wasteful of the defendant’s resources.  And he is not entitled to maintain unmeritorious proceedings in existence for the purpose of imposing pressure on the defendant to accept an offer it has steadfastly rejected.
In that context, I ought to mention, though briefly, the reasons of substance for the defendant’s stance in these proceedings.  These have been set out in some detail in correspondence and are summarised as follows in paragraph 40 of the first witness statement of Mr Wallbank:
“The implications were the Council to allow the claimant access to excavate the site cannot be understated:
breach of the terms of its licence with NRW;
escape of harmful substances into the environment;
damage caused by ground movement during or after excavation work;
risk to the health and safety of site staff whilst work is ongoing;
risk to health and safety of residents within the area of Docks Way whilst work is ongoing and subsequently;
exposure to the Council’s residents to potentially serious risks which raises public health issues and environmental concerns;
the inability of the Council to discharge its statutory waste disposal functions whilst the site is excavated.”
For the claimant, it is not accepted that these concerns are well-founded.  I am not called on to decide whether they are or not.  But it would be unfair, in a judgment concerned with fairly dry legal issues, to leave any impression that the defendant’s stance is based merely on legal right or that it had failed to have regard to its own wider responsibilities or the interests of the people of Newport.
Conclusion
For the reasons given above, I consider that the particulars of claim do not show any reasonable grounds for bringing this case.  I also consider that the claim would have no realistic prospect of succeeding if it went to trial and that there is no other compelling reason why it should be disposed of at trial.  It follows that it is open to me to strike out the claim under CPR Part 3 or to give summary judgment for the defendant under CPR Part 24.  The latter course seems preferable.  There will be judgment for the defendant and the claim will be dismissed.
(Footnote reference from: 1)  More properly, three kinds.  But the category of “chattels real”, which comprises interests in land other than freehold estates and interests, has become for practical if not taxonomical purposes part of the land law.  Anyway, it has nothing to do with the present case.

DECISION ON PRELIMINARY ISSUE
Introduction
The issue in this case was whether HMRC can amend their statement of case issued in response to Barclays Bank PLC’s (“Barclays”) appeal and grounds of appeal against partial closure notices (“PCNs”) issued by HMRC on 22 August 2022 or whether the PCNs properly construed would prevent HMRC from doing so.
HMRC sought to make changes to paragraphs 12.1, 12.4, 19, 20 and 21-24. The parties had reached agreement on all the changes save for changes to paragraphs 12.1 and the new 12.4 before the hearing, albeit that HMRC were to produce further and better particulars of the new paragraphs 20-24.
I find the following facts for the purpose only of determining this issue and not for the purpose of the substantive hearing:
In 2008 HMRC securitised the beneficial ownership of $20billion worth of certain debt assets by assigning the equitable interest only in the debt assets to a company referred to as “Newfoundland”, a related party, in consideration of Newfoundland issuing senior and subordinated notes. Barclays used the senior notes as collateral in the US repo market.
The senior notes had a coupon of 3 month’s US$ LIBOR plus 250bps. The junior notes had a coupon equal to the balance of the interest on the debt assigned to Newfoundland. The subordinated note holder had the right to call for the redemption of both senior and junior notes.
The parties entered into a total return swap under which Newfoundland’s actual return on the notes was agreed to be exchanged for US$ LIBOR plus 280bps on the principal amount outstanding on the underlying loans.
Barclays continued to recognise the underlying loans in its solus accounts and did not recognise the senior or junior notes or the associated derivatives.
In 2014/15 the senior notes were transferred in tranches at their par value plus accrued but unpaid interest to two other Luxembourg subsidiaries acting in partnership which carried on business in Luxembourg. The partnership is known as “BCIP”. Barclays provided a loan to BCIP at US$ LIBOR plus 10bps which was drawn down in tranches. The parties also entered into derivative contracts which were designed to ensure that Barclays regulatory capital position was unaffected by Barclays’ exposure to BCIP.
In March 2015 the majority of the loan by Barclays to BCIP was repaid. BCIP borrowed the money from one of the two partners in BCIP called BCTL and another related party called Lamorak.  The loans had the same coupon as the BCIP loan. The BCIP loans were funded by BCTL transferring certain Newfoundland securities to Barclays under a repo agreement between BCTL and Barclays.
The coupons on the senior notes net of finance costs accrued in the Luxembourg entities were sheltered by Luxembourg losses.
Barclays in its solus accounts, recognised a failed derecognition liability (FDRL) equal to the consideration for the sale of the senior notes because it continued to recognise the underlying loans in its balance sheet and did not recognise the notes. Barclays also recognised an interest expense in respect of the FDRL on an amortised cost basis which was roughly equal to the coupon on the senior notes.
In its tax returns for the periods ended 31 December 2014 and 2015, Barclays recognised the coupon on the BCIP loan as income but deducted the FDRL interest expense, thereby giving rise to a net reduction in the taxable profit of £929,151 for 2014 and £63,800,069 for 2015 as compared with the profits had Barclays not sold the senior notes or entered into the BCIP loan.
HMRC opened an enquiry into the returns for 2014 and 2015 on 15 December 2016 under paragraph 24(1) Schedule 18 Finance Act 1998.  One of the matters that was subject to the enquiry were the arrangements described above and whether the arrangements were on arm’s length terms and whether a transfer pricing adjustment should be made. The correspondence between the parties was extensive.
Partial closure notices were issued on 22 August 2022 under para 32(1) Schedule 18 Finance Act 1988 accompanied by a covering letter dated 22 August 2022.
The parts of the closure notices and covering letter in dispute read as follows:
“About the matter we have finished checking
Details of the matter we have finished checking are shown below
Description of the matter
The arrangements transferring the Newfoundland senior notes to BCIP
Our conclusion about the matter
It is HMRC’s view that for transfer pricing the actual provision entered into between Barclays and [the two partners] acting in partnership as BCIP, differs from the arm’s length provision which would have been made between independent enterprises. As per section 147 TIOPA 2010 it is therefore appropriate for tax purposes to replace the actual provision with the arm’s length provision. HMRC’s view is that the actual provision would not have been entered into by independent parties acting at arm’s length and the actual provision is to be disregarded and replaced by no provision for tax purposes. The appropriate adjustment is to increase Barclays profits to what they would have been had the actual provision not been imposed.
Reason for the conclusion
HMRC’s reason for our conclusion is set out in the enclose ‘view of the matter’ letter.
The accompanying view of the matter letter also dated 22 August 2022 reads as follows:
‘Newfoundland’ enquiry APE 31 December 2014 and 31 December 2015 – HMRC’s ‘view of the matter’
“Following our recent discussions with Barclays on the sale of the Newfoundland (“NFL”) senior notes from Barclays Bank PLC (“BBPLC”) to Barclays Claudas Investments Partnership (“BCIP”), HMRC are now in a position to set out our view of the matter for the accounting periods ending 31 December 2014 and 2015.
Facts
The relevant facts are substantially set out in the ‘Statement of Facts’ papers agreed between Barclays and HMRC during the Newfoundland enquiry.
Transfer Pricing
It is HMRC’s view that the actual provision entered into between [the partners] acting in partnership as BCIP, and Barclays differs from the arm’s length provision which would have been made between independent enterprises. As per section 147 TIOPA 2010 it is therefore appropriate for tax purposes to replace the actual provision with the arm’s length provision which is detailed below.
Actual provision
The actual provision consists of the following connected transactions:
[the 2014 transactions are described – involving the sale of the Newfoundland Notes, the funding loan, the dates of prepayment of the funding loan, the funding of the prepayments, the credit risk mitigations
the transactions form a single provision because they are all interlinked and interdependent upon each other and were entered into in relation to the same arrangement.
[Details the function of the entities based in Luxembourg]
[ Deals with the lack of reward for the services provided by the Luxembourg entities.]
Arm’s Length Provision
HMRC’s view is that the actual provision would not have been entered into by independent parties acting at arm’s length. The actual provision is therefore to be disregarded and replaced by no provision for tax purposes. This is because:
When taken as a whole, the actual provision delivers an economically irrational outcome for Barclays. Specifically, Barclays has committed to recognising an expense in respect of the coupon on the [Newfoundland] senior notes and a significantly lower interest income on the funding loan, without recognising an arm’s length reward.
Based on the terms and conditions of the actual provision and ignoring the effect of the connection between Barclays and BCIP and the partners on the provision) Barclays suffers a material loss on both a pre and post-tax basis This means that there is no commercial incentive for independent persons to impose such provision.
This conclusion holds irrespective of whether any group exists. Barclays is not compensated for the net losses it incurs on terms that would have been adopted by independent parties: therefore, the outcome is not at arm’s length at the level of Barclays. It is not possible to adjust the sale price to compensate Barclays for the losses it incurs as the price an independent party would pay for the senior notes is capped at close to par plus accrued interest. This is because the senior noteholder (Barclays) holds the right to call for the securitisation to be unwound at par value on 30 days’ notice.
It is not appropriate to consider any commercial benefits which may flow back to Barclays from BCIP …. Which only arise due to their connectivity in determining the economical rationality of the parties. This is because such a benefit would not be present between independent parties.
The CRM arrangement also affect the commerciality ….
It is therefore HMRC’s view that the Newfoundland transactions entered into by Barclays and BCIP meet the conditions for non recognition  set out in para 1.122 and 1.123 of the 2017 TPG. Therefore, for the accounting periods ending 31 December 2014 and 31 December 2015, the appropriate adjustment to the taxable profits of Barclays under section 147(3) TIOPA 2010 is to increase its profits to what these profits would have been, had the actual provision not been imposed.”
HMRC sought to amend their statement of case to include the possibility of a transfer pricing adjustment other than complete disregard of the transaction and to expand the arrangements to include the prior arrangements in 2008.
Barclays objected to HMRC’s proposed amendments.
At the opening of the hearing only the amendment to clause 12.1 and the new clause 12.4  of HMRC’s Statement of Case were contested.
HMRC state that the main purpose of the amendments to HMRC’s statement of case is clarificatory. HMRC explained that in seeking to agree a set of facts it became clear that Barclays misunderstood the case. The burden of proof is on Barclays to show its returns are correct. Barclays must set out its case for HMRC to respond.
HMRC consider it is in the interests of justice for these points to be made in HMRC’s Statement of Case to allow the parties to better prepare for the hearing. The issues have been discussed since January 2024 when HMRC set out their view on the case. HMRC consider that the substance of the amendments was identified as it stems from the partial closure notice and there is no prejudice to Barclays and Barclays have not pleaded prejudice.
Barclays objects to the amendments to paragraphs 12.1 and the new paragraph  12.4 of HMRC’s statement of case because Barclays considers that they fall outside the scope and subject matter of the appeal because  they represent wholly different conclusions to the conclusion reached in each of the two PCNs.
The statutory provisions
Closure notices – Schedule 18 Finance Act 1998 (Schedule 18)
Para 31 of Schedule 18 provides that any matter that is subject to an enquiry is completed when HMRC informs the company by notice (a partial closure notice) that they have completed their inquiry into the matter.
Para 34 (2) provides that where a partial closure notice is issued the notice “must state the officer’s conclusions and:
state that, in the officer’s opinion, no amendment is required of the return that was the subject of the enquiry, or
make the amendments of that return that are required –
to give effect to the conclusions stated in the notice, and”
Para 34(3) permits an appeal to be brought against “an amendment of a company’s return” under para 34(2). And 34(4) requires the appeal to be made to the officer by whom the partial closure notice was issued, in writing within 30 days.
Appeals and Reviews – Sections 49A, 49B, 49E, 49G and 49I Taxes Management Act 1970 (“TMA”)
Section 49A applies where an appeal has been made to HMRC. The appellant can request a review, HMRC can offer a review or the appellant may notify the appeal to the Tribunal.
Section 49B applies where the appellant has asked for a review. Section 49B(2) requires HMRC “to notify the appellant of HMRC’s view of the matter in question.”
Section 49E (5) permits HMRC to uphold, vary or cancel HMRC’s view of the matter as set out in the partial closure notice. Section 49E(6) requires HMRC to notify the appellant of the conclusions of the review and their reasoning within a specified period. Failure to do so results in the conclusions being upheld.
Section 49G deals with notification of the appeal to the Tribunal by the appellant after the review has been concluded. Section 49G(4) states that where an appellant notifies the Tribunal of an appeal, “the tribunal is to determine the matter in question”.
Section 49I (1) defines “matter in question” as “the matter to which the appeal relates”.
Section 50(6) provides that is on an appeal the Tribunal considers an appellant to have been overcharged by an assessment, the assessment shall be reduced accordingly.
Transfer Pricing Provisions
I set these provisions out in full as the structure of the provisions is pertinent to HMRC’s case as to what is a conclusion and what is a reason and to Barclays case as to what is the conclusion.
Section 147 Taxation (International and Other Pprovisions) Act 2010 (“TIOPA”) provides:
“147 Tax calculations to be based on arm's length, not actual, provision
For the purposes of this section “the basic pre-condition” is that—
provision (“the actual provision”) has been made or imposed as between any two persons (“the affected persons”) by means of a transaction or series of transactions,
the participation condition is met (see section 148),
the actual provision is not within subsection (7) (oil transactions), and
the actual provision differs from the provision (“the arm's length provision”) which would have been made as between independent enterprises.
Subsection (3) applies if—
the basic pre-condition is met, and
the actual provision confers a potential advantage in relation to United Kingdom taxation on one of the affected persons.
The profits and losses of the potentially advantaged person are to be calculated for tax purposes as if the arm's length provision had been made or imposed instead of the actual provision.
Subsection (5) applies if—
the basic pre-condition is met, and
the actual provision confers a potential advantage in relation to United Kingdom taxation (whether or not the same advantage) on each of the affected persons.
The profits and losses of each of the affected persons are to be calculated for tax purposes as if the arm's length provision had been made or imposed instead of the actual provision.
Subsections (3) and (5) have effect subject to—
section 165 (exemption for dormant companies),
section 166 (exemption for small and medium-sized enterprises),
[(ba) section 206A (modification of basic rule where allowances restricted for certain oil-related expenditure),]
section 213 (this Part generally does not affect calculation of capital allowances),
section 214 (this Part generally does not affect calculation of chargeable gains),
section 447(5) and (6) of CTA 2009 (this Part generally does not affect how exchange gains or losses from loan relationships are accounted for), . . .
section 694(8) and (9) of CTA 2009 (this Part generally does not affect how exchange gains or losses from derivative contracts are accounted for)[, and
section 938N of CTA 2010 (this Part treated as of no effect for the purposes of Part 21B of CTA 2010 (group mismatch schemes))].
The actual provision is within this subsection if it is made or imposed by means of any transaction or deemed transaction in the case of which the price or consideration is determined in accordance with any of sections 225F to 225J of ITTOIA 2005 or any of sections 281 to 285 of CTA 2010 (transactions and deemed transactions involving oil treated as made at market value).
Section 148 deals with the participation condition. The parties agree that the participation condition is satisfied.
151 “Arm's length provision”
In this Part “the arm's length provision” has the meaning given by section 147(1).
For the purposes of this Part, the cases in which provision made or imposed as between any two persons is to be taken to differ from the provision that would have been made as between  independent enterprises include the case in which provision is made or imposed as between two persons but no provision would have been made as between independent enterprises; and references in this Part to the arm's length provision are to be read accordingly.”
155 “Potential advantage” in relation to United Kingdom taxation
Subsection (2) applies for the purposes of this Part.
The actual provision confers a potential advantage on a person in relation to United Kingdom taxation wherever, disregarding this Part, the effect of making or imposing the actual provision, instead of the arm's length provision, would be one or both of Effects A and B.
Effect A is that a smaller amount (which may be nil) would be taken for tax purposes to be the amount of the person's profits for any chargeable period.
Effect B is that a larger amount (or, if there would not otherwise have been losses, any amount of more than nil) would be taken for tax purposes to be the amount for any chargeable period of any losses of the person.”
HMRC’s case
HMRC state that the amendments at 12.1, and 12.4, of the Statement of Case are within the Tribunal’s jurisdiction, they are clarificatory in nature and in allowing HMRC to make them will further the Tribunal’s overriding objective of dealing with the cases fairly and justly.
On any view the PCN’s dated 22 August 2022 concerned the arrangements involving the transfer of the Newfoundland senior notes to BCIP and the conclusion is that section 147 TIOPA applies.
The amendments to the returns increased the profits of Barclays to what they would have been had the actual provision not occurred. The scope of the appeal is therefore the transfer pricing treatment of the actual provision pursuant to section 147 TIOPA.
HMRC’s primary reason for saying the actual provision differs from the arm’s length provision is that the arrangements wouldn’t have been entered into by persons at arm’s length. This is the no provision approach. But it does not change the scope of the appeal that the amendments were made because the actual provision was different from the arm’s length provision within section 147 TIOPA.
HMRC say that Barclays’ case is that the appeal comprises one issue only- whether no provision would have been made between arm’s length parties. If that were the case the Tribunal would be unable to dismiss the appeal even if the arm’s length provision resulted in the same adjustments as were made by HMRC or a modest adjustment would be made to the amendment. This is akin to saying the Tribunal has no jurisdiction if there is another reason for the conclusion.
HMRC say Barclays’ approach conflates conclusions and reasons.  It seeks to tie the hands of the Tribunal and is inconsistent with Barclays’ own grounds of appeal which propose that the actual provision may be replaced with an arm’s length provision at para [9].
The PCNs were issued under Para 32(1) of Schedule 18 when HMRC concluded their enquiries into the matter and, as required by para 34(2), the PCNs contained the officer’s conclusions and indicated what amendments were required to be made to the return. Para 34(3) provides that an appeal may be made against the amendments to the return.
The scope of the current appeal is therefore governed by the principles regarding closure notices set out by the High Court, Court of Appeal and Supreme Court in Tower MCashback LLP and another v Revenue & Customs Commissioners [2008] STC 3366(HC), [2010] STC 809 (CA) and [2011] STC 1143 (SC) (“Tower MCashback”). (The case concerned an appeal against conclusions and amendments and not an appeal against amendments under Finance Act 1998 but the principles apply nonetheless.)
The subject matter of an appeal is defined by the subject matter of an enquiry and the subject matter of the conclusions which close the enquiry, per Moses LJ at [35]
Although the subject matter of an appeal is defined by the conclusions and amendment to the return, section 50 TMA does not bind the hands of the Tribunal to the precise wording of the closure notice when hearing the appeal, per Lord Hope at [84].
A closure notice ought not to be construed as if it were a statute, or as if its conclusions, reasons and adjustments were contained in watertight compartments, labelled accordingly. The FTT cannot be deprived of jurisdiction where it reasonably concludes that a new issue raised on an appeal represents a new or alternative ground for supporting the conclusion. See Kitchen LJ in Fidex Ltd v Revenue & Customs Commissioners [2016] EWCA Civ STC at [51] (“Fidex”).
These principles were followed by the UT in B&K Lavery Property Trading Partnership v Revenue and Customs Commissioners [2016] UKUT 525 (TC) (“Lavery”), see  Judges Bishopp and Falk at [34] to [38]. The UT confirmed that a closure notice must be considered in its context not only where the closure notice is ambiguous, the identification of any surrounding circumstances requires questions of fact to be determined and following Chitty on Contracts, construing written instruments is a mixed question of law and fact. The issue becomes one of law once the facts are determined.
Identifying the context against which the closure notice must be construed is a question of fact. This is the role of the FTT/Special Commissioners. In Tower MCashback Moses LJ indicates that:
The FTT have to balance the need to preserve the protection for the taxpayer not to be ambushed against the need to protect the public from loss of tax, see [38].
It is the FTT to which the legislation looks to identify what section 28ZA TMA describes as the subject matter of the enquiry see [41].  Contrary to the view of Henderson J in the High Court, the FTT must identify the subject matter of the appeal [50] and the closure notice itself does not allow so restrictive a view of the subject matter of the appeal [51]. Moses LJ’s comments at [41],[50] and [51] were approved by Lord Walker in the Supreme Court
The principles that are to be applied in determining the scope of an appeal by reference to the content of the closure notice were summarised by the Court of Appeal in HMRC v LG Park Ltd  [2023] EWCA Civ 1193 , 4WLR 83 at [47] and [48] (“LG Park Ltd”) which endorsed its own decision in Investec Asset Finance PLC v HMRC [2020] EWCA Civ 579 at [70] to [73] (“Investec”):
The changes made to the legislation to deal with self-assessment were not intended to dramatically narrow the scope of an appeal.
There are protections for the taxpayer, but a narrow confinement of the subject matter was not intended to be one of them.
Further, the venerable principle of tax law to the effect that there is a public interest in taxpayers paying the correct amount of tax, also has a role to play.
The FTT must determine the scope of an appeal and is best placed to consider the context of the closure notice and the surrounding circumstances to determine whether the subject matter of the appeal is broader than the particular conclusion and adjustments addressed in the closure notice. So HMRC should be allowed to put forward further arguments in an appeal even if they result in larger amounts of tax being due, provided all the different arguments deal with the same matters in question identified in the closure notice.
In some cases, HMRC may not be restricted to advancing further reasons in support of conclusions but may also be entitled to take a different approach from that taken on the face of it in the Closure Notice, including one that could result in more tax being due.
The Upper Tribunal in Daarasp LLP v The Commissioners of HM Revenue & Customs [2019] UKUT (“Daarasp”) recites the principles to be applied in construing the scope of the closure notice at [25]. The venerable principle is referred to at (10). The Upper Tribunal  confirm that there are checks and balances in the legislative scheme of self-assessment designed to protect the taxpayer but a narrow confinement of the subject matter of the appeal is not intended to be one such protection for the taxpayer. The venerable principle - that taxpayers should pay the correct amount of tax – is also an important underlying factor in any tax matter and has a role to play in interpretating a closure notice.
The correct construction of the PCNs in this case in HMRC’s view is:
The matter being considered is the arrangements transferring the Newfoundland senior notes to BCIP (including those in 2008) and the correct interpretation of the conclusions and amendments is the correct transfer pricing of the arrangements. It is not a narrow subject matter but a reasonably open one.  This is supported by
the wording of the PCN’s- the conclusion is that the actual provision differs from an arm’s length provision and section 147 applies. The amendment is explained by HMRC’s view on the arm’s length provision. The no provision argument is the reason for the amendment not the conclusion. The conclusion is that the arm’s length provision should be substituted for the actual provision.  The appellant’s view is too narrow. They construe the PCN as if it were a statute which is cautioned against in the authorities. They focus on the words “no provision” under the heading “Our conclusion about the matter” which supports a form over substance approach and seeks to restrict the jurisdiction of the courts, contrary to authority.
the context as revealed in correspondence and notes of meetings during the enquiry, reveals the scope of the enquiry which is the correct transfer pricing of the arrangements and the application of section 147 TIOPA. Only in the last stage of the enquiry did HMRC identify the no provision reason. It was only a reason for the application of section 147 and was adopted as the most prominent reason.
Barclays’ own construction of the PCNs as set out in their grounds of appeal supports HMRC’s construction of the PCNs. It is open to the Tribunal to determine the correct arm’s length provision. Barclays may not be allowed to plead that where the provision entered into between Barclays and BCIP is not arm’s length there is some unidentified and unparticularised pricing that can be done so that the no provision reason fails.
the venerable principle and section 50 TMA.  The Court of Appeal has indicated that this has a part to play in construing closure notices. Barclays approach seeks to tie the hands of the Tribunal by arguing that if the provision is not arm’s length and the no provision argument is wrong, then the Tribunal cannot determine the correct approach.  This is wrong in logic and law.
Accordingly, the subject matter of the PCN’s covers the amendments made by HMRC in their statement of case and invite the Tribunal to allow HMRC to amend their statement of case as set out in the Appendix 1 to their applications.
Barclays’s case
Barclays objects to the amendments made to HMRCs statement of case at paragraphs 12.1 and 12.4  because they represent a wholly different conclusion from that stated in the PCNs.  Specifically:
The actual provision now being referred to in para 12.1 includes the 2008 securitisation transaction and not just the 2014 sale of the senior notes.
The new para 12.4 now contemplates that the provision may be entered into by independent parties but would have been priced differently form the actual provision.
Barclays view of the case law as it applies to the meaning of the closure notice:
Barclays accepts that the principles established in Tower MCashback apply equally to a case such as this which is an appeal by a company under the Finance Act 1998 as it does to appeal by individuals under the Taxes Management Act 1970. This is so notwithstanding that appeals by companies are against amendments make to assessments whereas appeals by individuals may be made against conclusions or amendments. The appeal in Tower MCashback was in fact just an appeal against an amendment.
Barclays points out that in Tower MCashback the closure notice stated merely that the claim for 100% capital allowances on the provision of software was excessive and the claim was reduced to nil. The covering letter of the closure notice stated that the claim for capital allowances was denied by virtue of section 45(4) applying. (Section 45 is a technical provision concerning the claimant granting rights to another person to use or otherwise deal with the software.)  After the appeal by the taxpayer HMRC argued in the alternative that the expenditure had not been on software.
The Special Commissioner considered HMRC had the right to raise another reason because the conclusion in the closure notice permitted them to do so.  Henderson J considered that the correct principle was that the scope and subject matter of the appeal was defined by the conclusions stated and amendments made in the closure notice but the subject matter of the appeal had to be determined in context. In the closure notice the officer had said “I have concluded my enquiries … As previously indicated my conclusion is … the claim for relief under section 45 is excessive …” The covering letter referred to section 45(4). It also indicated that there may be other issues. In construing the closure notice Henderson J considered reference had to be had to the accompanying letter and therefore the subject matter of the appeal was confined to section 45(4). Moses LJ did not follow Henderson J  because he considered the closure notice was plain on its face and there was no need to refer to the previous correspondence. Other reasons could be given for the conclusion. The appeal is against the conclusion.  Lord Walker at [15] agreed with Henderson J about the scope of the appeal being determined by the conclusions in closure notice and not the reasons but did not accept Henerson J’s application of the principles and therefore the interpretation of the closure notice. Lord Walker adopted the approach of Moses LJ at [17] that it is for the Tribunal to determine what the conclusion was but cautioned against wide ranging closure notices at [18].
Barclays referred to Lord Hope at [84] where he indicates that the scope of the appeal is defined by the conclusions and amendments, but the Tribunal is not confined to the precise wording of the closure notice when hearing the appeal. Judge Raghavan considered in Towers Watson v HMRC [2017] UKFTT 0846 at [28] that this meant that there could be other reasons for the conclusion.
Barclays argues that all the courts in Tower MCashback held that the scope and subject matter of an appeal are defined by the conclusions and amendments in closure notice.  The Courts did not agree with the Special Commissioner that even if the closure notice had just referred to section 45(4) HMRC would still be entitled to run a different argument.
Barclays consider that Kitchen LJ in Fidex simply adopted Tower MCashback indicating that the scope and subject matter of an appeal is determined by the conclusions and amendments in the Closure Notice, not the process of reasoning. The closure notice must be read in context to properly understand its meaning. New reasons can be advanced by HMRC subject to proper case management. In Fidex a loss created by derecognition of loans on a change of accounting basis was reduced to zero. HMRC sought to deny the loss on an alternative basis under para 13 of Schedule 9 to Finance Act 1996. The conclusion in the closure notice was found to be the sum of £83.9m representing the value of the derecognised bonds ought not to have been included in the change of basis adjustments. The reason was found to be the derecognition of the bonds should not have occurred. Other reasons were therefore admissible.  The Tribunal unpicked the conclusion from the reasons. But the subject matter of the enquiry does not of itself expand the scope of the appeal against a conclusion [44]. It is the context but does not necessarily inform the conclusion.
Barclays point out that in 2020 HMRC issued new templates for closure notices to separate the conclusions form the reasons. The third sentence in the conclusions is therefore a conclusion not a reason.
Barclays also refer to the case of Investec and consider it is authority for the proposition that the scope and subject matter of the appeal  are defined by the conclusions stated in the closure notice and the amendments made to the return except where the context of the closure notice and the surrounding circumstances  demonstrate that the subject matter is broader such as where it is clear HMRC intend to advance further arguments. Barclays say there is no such circumstance here. And there was no reference to any alternative argument in the correspondence in the two-year period before the closure notice was issued.
Thus the statements in Tower MCashback that the scope and subject matter of an appeal are defined by conclusions stated in the closure notice and by the amendments made to the return continue to represent the law subject to the exception in Investec. Barclays consider that Rose LJ’s comments in Investec and Falk LJ in LG Park HTI Limited v HMRC need to be understood by the facts in Investec.  The venerable principle applies to construe statutory phrases not the meaning of the closure notice. Ordinary principles must apply in construing a closure notice.
Barclays refer to Court of Appeal decision in HMRC v Bristol & West PLC [2016] EWCA Civ 397 at [24] that  HMRC has no power to amend a return otherwise than to give effect to the conclusion and that a closure notice ought to be interpreted objectively, as it would be understood by a reasonable person in the position of the intended recipient, having knowledge of the relevant context. There is therefore no scope for the application of the venerable principle.
Barclays also refers to the case of Daarasp which confirms it is the conclusions which determine the scope of an appeal and not the reasons. Barclays consider that Daarasp confirms that the venerable principle has no role to play in the interpretation of the closure notice only the statutory provisions.
In relation to transfer pricing Barclays say that section 147(1) sets out the basic precondition for transfer pricing adjustments. The two relevant elements are the actual provision and the arm’s length provision. The two elements must differ. Section 147(2) then states if the basic precondition is met and the actual provision confers a potential tax advantage in relation to UK tax on one of the parties, section 147(3) applies as if the arm’s length provision had been imposed and not the actual provision.  Tax advantage is defined in section 155 and requires a computation of the profits of the UK resident person, and it must be determined that the actual provision creates a smaller profit or greater loss. Further section 164 requires that the legislation be applied in a manner to secure consistency between the legislation and the OECD Transfer pricing guidelines published in 2010.  The guidelines identify irrational transactions that cannot be rationally transfer priced. The assignment by Barclays of the senior notes but its retention of the junior notes which gave Barclays the right to redeem all the notes would cause the senior notes to be less valuable to an arm’s length party than they would be to Barclays. HMRC concluded it was an impossibility to identify a price that would satisfy both parties. The guidelines also state that if a price can be alighted upon the transaction should not be disregarded. The majority of transfer pricing cases revolve around the identification of the arm’s length price. But if you are in the exceptional circumstance where no such alternative proce can be identified, then section 147(3) simply requires a disregard of the tax advantage. The tax advantage is easy to identify in the special circumstance: the whole of the deductions claimed are disregarded.  Section 147 clearly applies in the exceptional circumstance. At the opening of the enquiry HMRC looked at the interest on the loan but moved to considering the transaction as a whole and moved to considering derecognition of the transactions. There was no indication of an alternative view. But the reason there is no indication of an alternative view is HMRC thought it impossible. So HMRC pin their colours to the mast. HMRC say they did not close their mind to other reasons for transfer pricing to apply and point to 14 February 2022 letter. Barclays say that HMRC rejected that view and that is why they closed the enquiry. The correspondence shows the actual provision did not include the 2008 transaction and that the arm’s length provision was no provision.  The proper interpretation of the PCNs is that no provision is a conclusion. The Valentine’s day letter of 14 February 2022 shows HMRC rejected the argument that there is an arm’s length price. HMRC rejected the view and closed the enquiry. Barclays say HMRC had held that view for a very long time before closing the enquiry. Barclays pointed to correspondence, meeting notes and transfer pricing analyses in the period prior to the issue of the PCNs to demonstrate that the officer (Mr Haynes and later on Mr Belinski) had to all intents and purposes closed his mind to the idea of an alternatively priced transaction. The Officer had confined the focus of the enquiry most latterly to the 2014-15 transactions and consistently maintained that the actual provision ought to be disregarded with the resultant adjustment to the profits.
Turning to the construction of the PCNs, Barclays states that the conclusion in the closure notice is that:
The actual provision ought to be disregarded and replaced with no provision.
The actual provision being referred to is the arrangements in 2014-15 involving the transfer of senior notes between Barclays and BCIP , the prepayments funding and the CRM arrangements and not any other arrangements.
The covering letter of 22 August 2022 provides the context and makes clear that the matter which HMRC has concluded its enquiry into is the 2014-15 arrangements and the transactions listed are those that occurred in 2014-15.
There is no mention of an alternative reason.
It is impossible to interpret the PCNs as involving a provision which is the actual provision but priced differently.
Barclays construction of the PCNs is confirmed by the final sentence which requires profits to be increased to what they would have been had the actual provision not been imposed.
This construction is supported by the correspondence in which Officer Haynes consistently states that it is HMRC’s view that the actual provision must be disregarded because it is impossible to identify an arm’s length price.
There is no conflation of reasons and conclusions as HMRC used the new template.
A reasonable recipient in receipt of the PCN would consider:
the conclusion to be that for transfer pricing purposes the actual provision consisting of the 2014-15 arrangements differs from the arm’s length provision which would be no provision and therefore the actual provision must be disregarded.
And the reason for the conclusion is as set out at paragraphs 2.6-2.7 of the letter enclosing the PCNs. The clear and deliberate separation ought not to be disregarded.
HMRC’s reasoning that the conclusion is that the actual provision differs from the arm’s length provision and therefore section 147 applies and the no provision argument is merely a reason should be rejected because, (a) the statement about the reasons appears under the heading “My Conclusion” and not under the heading “Reason for the conclusion”. and (b) The statutory provision requires that a tax advantage has to ensue as a result of the actual provision differing from the arm’s length provision. So no provision is an essential part of Mr Haynes’ conclusion.
Barclays has not tried to tie the hands of the Tribunal they have been tied by HMRC.
The Grounds of Appeal cannot enlarge to Tribunal’s jurisdiction.
Barclays consider that the scope and subject matter of the appeal is not broader than the conclusion stated in the PCNs. The context and surrounding circumstances do not demonstrate a wider subject matter of the appeal. This is clear from:
The absence of any statement by Officer Haynes that he intends to advance further arguments.
Thus the appeal is limited by the conclusion stated in the PCNs that the actual provision comprising the 2014 -15 arrangements involving the transfer of the senior notes to BCIP differs from the arm’s length provision which would have been no provision and therefore the actual provision must be disregarded.
HMRC’s contention that the scope of the appeal is the subject matter of the PCNs and the matter considered in the PCNs consists of the arrangements transferring the senior notes to BCIP confuses the matter which HMRC has finished checking on the one hand and the scope of the appeal on the other hand.
Barclays considers the proposed amendments to HMRC’s Statement of Case:
At 12.1 are not to “clarify” their case but to create an alternative that the actual provision includes the securitisation transactions in 2008. Barclays objects to this as the actual provision referred to in the closure notice refers to the 2014-15 transaction involving the transfer of the senior notes to BCIP which is being compared to the arm’s length provision not the earlier securitisation of 6 years ago. The Tribunal has no jurisdiction to consider the transfer pricing treatment of a different actual provision. This request to amend should be denied.
New para 12.4 is an extension not a clarification. It seeks to include that if the arm’s length provision is not no provision an alternative provision can be considered and an increase in the profits of Barclays. The existing conclusion is that no provision is the alternative arm’s length provision. The Tribunal has no jurisdiction to consider a different conclusion nor a different subject matter. Barclays asks the Tribunal to  direct that HMRC may not amend the statement of case to admit para 12.4.
Barclays does not object to the change to para 20 as it responds to one of its own grounds of appeal, nor does it object to the new paragraphs 21-24.
If the Tribunal permit the amendments to para 12.1 and the new 12.4 Barclays asks for further and better particulars.
Discussion and Decision
For the reasons set out below, in light of the principles set out in TowerMCashback, Fidex, Investec, Bristol & West,  and Daarsap, I conclude that:
Subject matter of the appeal is defined by the subject matter of the enquiry and the subject matter of the conclusions which closed the enquiry as set out in the PCNs.
The subject matter of the enquiry that was closed by the PCN’s is the arrangements between Barclays and BCI in 2014 and 2015 dealing with notes created pursuant to the arrangements made in 2008 and the application of the transfer pricing legislation in section 147 TIOPA. The arrangement in 2008 is just as much part of the 2014 and 2015 arrangements as the articles of association were part of the group relief arrangements in the case of Pilkington Brothers Limited v Commissioners of Inland Revenue 1982 UKHL 55 STC 705.
The conclusion reached by HMRC was as set out in the first two sentences of the section of the Closure Notice under the hearing “Our conclusion about the matter”. The first sentence states that it is HMRC’s view that for transfer pricing purposes the actual provision entered into by the parties differs from the arm’s length provision that would have been made between independent parties. The second sentence indicates the statutory provision that is in play is section 147 TIOPA 2010 which will replace the actual provision by the arm’s length provision.
The third sentence states that in HMRC’s view the actual provision would never be entered into by parties at arm’s length and the actual provision ought to be disregarded and replaced by no provision. The third sentence is a reason for the application of section 147 and the adjustment. This is just one possible reason as to why transfer pricing provisions should apply and is indicated as such in section 151(2) TIOPA.  HMRC may rely on other reasons.
The fourth sentence is a description of the adjustment.
In reaching this decision I have adopted the principles identified by the Supreme Court in TowerMCashback, the Court of Appeal in Investec and Fidex and Bristol & West and the UT in Daarasp namely:
Closure notices ought not to be construed like statutes.
The venerable principle has a part to play in all tax matters to ensure the correct amount of tax is collected. In this context it supports the interpretation of the closure notice in a manner to enable the correct amount of tax to be collected provided the taxpayer is not ambushed by late admissions of new argument.
The context may be considered to identify the meaning of the closure notice. The context includes the “view of the matter” letter issued by HMRC on 22 August 2022. That letter includes in the reasons section the third sentence of the conclusion. In my view this supports the view that the third sentence is a reason and not a conclusion. The enquiry was extensive. The issue of alternative pricing which could be an alternative reason was included in the discourse although not identified as HMRC’s primary reason for invoking the transfer pricing legislation.
Although the form of closure notices was altered to create a designated area to set out conclusions and a separate area to set out reasons, undue weight should not be attached to the fact that a reason for the application of the transfer pricing legislation has been incorporated into the conclusion section as well as the reasons section.
The correct interpretation of the notice depends on what a reasonable person in the position of Barclays with Barclays’ knowledge of the context would consider it to mean.  As Barclays grounds of appeal include the possibility of an alternative price it would seem to me that the interpretation contended for by HMRC satisfies this requirement.
In my view the conclusion is that the actual provision differs from the arm’s length provision and section 147 TIOPA applies. Additional reasons may be advanced as to why section 147 TIOPA applies other than the no provision reason. The adjustment reduced the claim for relief to zero.
The appeal is against the adjustments. The burden of proof in the appeal against the adjustments made by HMRC is on Barclays to demonstrate that the adjustments to the returns made by HMRC are incorrect. In other words, it is for Barclays to show that the actual provision does not differ from the arm’s length provision or indicate the price on which the transactions would be entered into by parties at arm’s length. The venerable principle requires that the Tribunal be able to dismiss the appeal in whole or in part depending on the evidence before it.
I allow the application but require the parties to agree appropriate directions.

DECISION
Introduction
The Appellant (Igor Kolosov) appeals against an assessment to excise duty (‘the Assessment”), in the sum of £1,109,311, raised pursuant to s 12(1A) of the Finance Act 1994 (“FA 1994”). The Assessment is dated 27 October 2020 and was raised after HMRC found evidence demonstrating that 3,602,800 counterfeit cigarettes (“the Goods”) had been held by the Appellant on 28 October 2019.
HMRC concluded that the Goods had been held by the Appellant outside a duty suspension arrangement in circumstances where excise duty had not been paid, relieved, remitted or deferred. HMRC, therefore, submit that the Appellant is liable to the Assessment because he was “holding” the Goods within the meaning of reg. 6(1)(b) of the Excise Goods (Holding, Movement and Duty Point) Regulations 2010 (“the Excise Duty Regulations”), and that he was a person who had handled the Goods. HMRC further submit that the Appellant was able to control access to the Premises at which the deliveries took place.
The Appellant’s case is that he was innocent of any wrongdoing as he believed that he was unloading vegetarian food, and not tobacco, at the time that he was observed unloading the Goods. He further states that he cannot afford to pay the amount due under the Assessment.
Whilst the hearing on 26 September 2024 was a face-to-face hearing, with the consent of the parties, the form of the resumed hearing on 10 December 2024 was V (video).  Prior notice of the hearing had been published on the gov.uk website, with information about how representatives of the media or members of the public could apply to join the hearing remotely in order to observe the proceedings.  As such, the hearing was held in public.
Issue(s)
The issue in this appeal is whether the Appellant is liable for the Assessment. This, in turn, requires consideration of the issue of whether the Appellant “held” excise goods (i.e., the Goods).
Burden and standard of proof
HMRC have the burden of proving that they have issued a valid Assessment.
Pursuant to s 16(6) FA 1994, the burden of proof is on the Appellant to show that: (i) the there is no liability to excise duty. In this respect, s 154(2)(a) of the Customs and Excise Management Act 1979 (“CEMA”) provides that where, in any proceedings relating to customs or excise, any question arises as to whether or not any duty has been paid or secured in respect of any goods, then where those proceedings are brought by or against the Commissioners, the burden of proof shall lie upon the other party to the proceedings.
The standard of proof is the ordinary civil standard; that of a balance of probabilities.
The documents
The documents to which we were referred included the: (i) Documents Bundle consisting of 550 pages (within which were the Notice of Appeal and the Statement of Case dated 18 November 2022); and (ii) HMRC’s Skeleton Argument dated 18 September 2024.
Background facts
On 28 October 2019, HMRC were notified by Norfolk Police that an HGV lorry (“the lorry”) had unloaded pallets of cigarettes at the premises of “Kai Timber and Fencing”; a unit at Boundary Road West, Alexander Dock, ABP Kings Lynn (“the Premises”). Investigators had recovered CCTV footage from the Premises.
For ease of reference, the individuals referred to in this appeal are:
Name
Initials
Daniel Danielius (driver of the Mercedes observed at the Premises)
D.D.
Abdul Latif Abdullah (driver of the Mercedes Van observed at the Premises)
A.L.A.
Gus (Steve) Auker (Appellant’s employer)
G.A.
Vitanus/Vitook (Appellant’s contact said to have made the arrangement)
Vitus
Edward Wojciechowski (driver of the lorry)
E.W.
Michael Turner (an employee and childhood friend of G.A.)
M.T.
Mark McCabe (another employee of G.A. working at an adjacent business)
M.M.
Anna Kuksinova (contact on the Appellant’s phone)
A.K.
Following investigations, HMRC Officers confirmed that the lorry had entered the United Kingdom at Tilbury docks and travelled to the Premises. The Appellant - a forklift driver and an employee at the Premises - had been observed unloading several pallets from the lorry. The two other vehicles observed at the Premises have been identified as a Mercedes, belonging to D.D. and a Mercedes Van belonging to A.L.A.  The police had cut through padlocks at the Premises and identified 19 pallets containing clear wrapped boxes labelled “Richmond King-size cigarettes”. A tally of the contents identified a total of 3,602,800 cigarettes. The consignment was, however, described as “frozen foods”. The employer at the Premises, G.A., was said to have been unaware of the arrangement for the delivery and unloading of the Goods at the Premises.
On the same date (28 October 2019), the Appellant was interviewed and arrested on suspicion of the fraudulent evasion of excise goods, contrary to s 170 CEMA. HMRC Officers Richard Peacock and Alison Chaplin conducted the interview. The Appellant explained that he had accepted payment of £50 from Vitus to assist in unloading the Goods, having agreed to use the Premises to do so. The Appellant stated that he was contacted by Vitus, who had arrived at his home address at 6pm on 27 October 2019 and had asked him to help him to unload a trailer that would arrive at the Premises. He added that he has known Vitus for seven to eight years and used to work with him at a chocolate factory. The Appellant’s position was that he had agreed to use the Premises because he had a forklift there. The Appellant also stated that he asked Vitus if the load was illegal, and Vitus had said that it was not. The Appellant claims he was told by Vitus that the load contained vegetarian food.
Analysis of the Appellant’s mobile phone showed photos of tobacco sent to him on 8 September 2018 from a number registered to A.K., with an address in Dover. Investigators also identified a contact on the Appellant’s phone called “Vitus”, as well as communications with D.D.
On 8 November 2019, E.W., the driver of the lorry, was detained and interviewed. He stated that he had collected the Goods in Czaplinek, Poland, where the trailer was loaded. He subsequently delivered the Goods to the Premises on 28 October 2019.
On 12 November 2019, G.A. gave a voluntary interview. He stated that he did not attend the Premises on the morning of 28 October 2019 as he was at a speed awareness course. He further stated that M.T. had telephoned him on the morning of 28 October to tell him that there was a refrigerated HGV lorry at the unit in the Premises. G.A. confirmed that he knew nothing about the delivery and stated that it should not have been there. He further stated that he knew nothing about the Goods, or that the Appellant was planning to take the delivery. G.A. arrived at the Premises at approximately 13.45hrs, after the police had arrived. M.T. and M.M., who were working at “Gus Auker Pipe Installations” (the unit adjacent to the Premises) on the morning of the 28 October 2019, also gave witness evidence.
On 3 June 2020, the Goods were confirmed as being counterfeit. HMRC have since seized the Goods.
On 27 October 2020, Officer Alexander Collingwood (of HMRC) issued the Assessment to the Appellant.
On 11 February 2021, the Appellant filed a Notice of Appeal against the Assessment. The appeal was stayed pending criminal investigations.
On 26 May 2021, the Appellant was interviewed by HMRC Officers Lucy Craig and Chris Price, for the purposes of the criminal investigation. When asked if he wanted to add anything to his original account, the Appellant replied “nothing changed”.
On 18 June 2021, HMRC confirmed that hardship had been granted.
On 23 December 2021, the Appellant filed and served a letter protesting his innocence in any wrongdoing.
In 2022, the Crown Prosecution Service (‘CPS’) confirmed to HMRC that no charges would be brought against the Appellant for the fraudulent evasion of excise duty.
On 16 October 2023, the Appellant filed and served a letter/witness statement repeating the statements made in his letter dated 23 December 2021.
Joint and several liability
On 5 May 2021, D.D. was interviewed under caution. During his interview, he stated that a person called Piotr/Peter had approached him at the gym and asked if could move a load, urgently, for payment of £500. He added that he believed that the load contained onions. After receiving the Goods at the Premises, D.D said that he and A.L.A. followed Peter to a warehouse in Peterborough.
On 5 May 2021, A.L.A stated that D.D. was a known associate of his, and that he had helped him move furniture in the past. He added that D.D. had called him and asked him for four runs with his van from Kings Lynn to Peterborough and back, for a total of £1,000.
On 13 September 2021, HMRC issued a notice of liability to D.D. and A.L.A., on a joint and several-basis. These decisions have not been appealed by either individual.
Relevant law
The relevant law, so far as is material to the issues in this appeal, is as follows:
Section 1(1)(a) and 2(1) of the Tobacco Products Duty Act 1979 provide that excise duty shall be charged on tobacco products imported into, or manufactured in, the United Kingdom.
Section 170(1)(b) CEMA makes it a criminal offence to knowingly be concerned in carrying, removing, depositing, harbouring, keeping or concealing, or in any manner dealing with any goods which are chargeable with a duty which has not been paid, with intent to defraud HMRC of any duty payable on the goods.
The Excise Duty Directive
Council Directive 2008/118 EC (“the Excise Duty Directive”) laid down general arrangements for the harmonisation of excise duty across the EU. Article 1(c) of the Excise Duty Directive provides that:
Article 1
1.This Directive lays down general arrangements in relation to excise duty which is levied directly or indirectly on the consumption of the following goods (hereinafter ‘excise goods’):
…
manufactured tobacco covered by Directives 95/59/EC, 92/79/EEC and 92/80/EEC.”
Article 4 provides that:
Article 4
For the purpose of this Directive as well as its implementing provisions, the following definitions shall apply:
…
7.‘duty suspension arrangement’ means a tax arrangement applied to the production, processing, holding or movement of excise goods not covered by a customs suspensive procedure or arrangement, excise duty being suspended; …”
Chapter II “Chargeability, reimbursement, exemption”, Section 1, deals with the “Time and place of chargeability”.
Article 7 provides the definition of “release for consumption”:
Article 7
1.Excise duty shall become chargeable at the time, and in the Member State, of release for consumption.
2.For the purposes of this Directive, ‘release for consumption’ shall mean any of the following:
…
(b)the holding of excise goods outside a duty suspension arrangement where excise duty has not been levied pursuant to the applicable provisions of Community law and national legislation; …”
Article 8 then provides that:
Article 8
1.The person liable to pay the excise duty that has become chargeable shall be:
…
(b)in relation to the holding of excise goods as referred to in Article 7(2)(b): the person holding the excise goods and any other person involved in the holding of the excise goods;
…
2.Where several persons are liable for payment of one excise duty debt, they shall be jointly and severally liable for such debt.”
Section 2 provides, so far as relevant, as follows:
“Section 2
Holding in another Member State
Article 33 (Excise goods already released for consumption in one Member State)
Without prejudice to Article 36(1), where excise goods which have already been released for consumption in one Member State are held for commercial purposes in another Member State in order to be delivered or used there, they shall be subject to excise duty and excise duty shall become chargeable in that other Member State.
For the purposes of this Article, ‘holding for commercial purposes’ shall mean the holding of excise goods by a person other than a private individual or by a private individual for reasons other than his own use and transported by him, in accordance with Article 32.
The chargeability conditions and rate of excise duty to be applied shall be those in force on the date on which duty becomes chargeable in that other Member State.
The person liable to pay the excise duty which has become chargeable shall be, depending on the cases referred to in paragraph 1, the person making the delivery or holding the goods intended for delivery, or to whom the goods are delivered in the other Member State.
Without prejudice to Article 38, where excise goods which have already been released for consumption in one Member State move within the Community for commercial purposes, they shall not be regarded as held for those purposes until they reach the Member State of destination, provided that they are moving under cover of the formalities set out in Article 34.”
Section 1 of the Finance (No. 2) Act 1992 contains the authority for making regulations to implement the provisions of the Excise Duty Directive concerning the chargeability of goods to excise duty in the United Kingdom, and persons liable to pay such duty.
The Excise Duty Regulations implement the provisions of the Excise Duty Directive.
The Excise Duty Regulations
Regulation 5 of the Excise Duty Regulations provides that there is an excise “duty point” at the time when excise goods are “released for consumption” in the United Kingdom.
Regulation 6 deals with excise duty points, as follows:
—(1) Excise goods are released for consumption in the United Kingdom at the time when the goods—
leave a duty suspension arrangement;
are held outside a duty suspension arrangement and ... excise duty on those goods has not been paid, relieved, remitted or deferred under a duty deferment arrangement;
are produced outside a duty suspension arrangement; or
are charged with duty at importation unless they are placed, immediately upon importation, under a duty suspension arrangement.”
Therefore, four excise duty points are prescribed by reg. 6 (which deals goods being held outside a “duty suspension arrangement”).
Regulation 10(1) identifies the person liable to pay the duty when excise goods are released for consumption as the person “holding” excise goods at that time:
—(1) The person liable to pay the duty when excise goods are released for consumption by virtue of regulation 6(1)(b) (holding of excise goods outside a duty suspension arrangement) is the person holding the excise goods at that time.
Any other person involved in the holding of the excise goods is jointly and severally liable to pay the duty with the person specified in paragraph (1).”
Regulation 13 provides that:
“13.-(1) Where excise goods already released for consumption in another Member State are held for a commercial purpose in the UK in order to be delivered or used in the UK, the excise duty point is the time when those goods are first so held.
Depending on the cases referred to in paragraph (1), the person liable to pay the duty is the person –
making the delivery of the goods;
holding the goods intended for delivery; or
to whom the goods are delivered.”
What Reg.13(1) seeks to identify is the first excise duty point in the United Kingdom and it therefore looks to the first time at which the goods are held for a commercial purpose in the United Kingdom.
Regulation 88 of the Excise Duty Regulations deals with forfeiture, and provides that:
“If in relation to any excise goods that are liable to duty that has not been paid there is—
a contravention of any provision of these Regulations, or (b) a contravention of any condition or restriction imposed by or under these Regulations, those goods shall be liable to forfeiture.”
Regulation 20(1) of the Excise Duty Regulations has the effect that duty must be paid at or before an excise duty point.
CEMA
Section 139 CEMA provides that:
Provisions as to detention, seizure and condemnation of goods, etc.
Anything liable to forfeiture under the customs and excise Acts may be seized, or detained, by any officer or constable or any member of HM Armed Forces, or coastguard.
…
Subject to subsections (3) and (4) above and to Schedules 2A and 3 to this Act, any thing seized or detained under the customs and excise Acts shall, pending the determination as to its forfeiture or disposal, be dealt with, and, if condemned or deemed to have been condemned or forfeited, shall be disposed of in such manner as the Commissioners may direct.
Schedule 3 to this Act shall have effect for the purpose of forfeitures, and of proceedings for the condemnation of any thing as being forfeited, under the customs and excise Acts.”
Paragraph 5 of Schedule 5 CEMA provides that:
If on the expiration of the relevant period under paragraph 3 above for the giving of notice of claim in respect of any thing no such notice has been given to the Commissioners, or if, in the case of any such notice given, any requirement of paragraph 4 above is not complied with, the thing in question shall be deemed to have been duly condemned as forfeited.”
Section 154(2)(a) CEMA provides that:
Where in any proceedings relating to customs or excise any question arises as to the place from which any goods have been brought or as to whether or not—
any duty has been paid or secured in respect of any goods; ...
then, where those proceedings are brought by or against the Commissioners, a law officer of the Crown or an officer, or against any other person in respect of anything purporting to have been done in pursuance of any power or duty conferred or imposed on him by or under the customs and excise Acts, the burden of proof shall lie upon the other party to the proceedings.”
The Assessment
HMRC are empowered to raise an excise assessment under s 12(1A) FA 1994, which provides that:
“where it appears to the Commissioners that any person is a person whom any amount has become due in respect of any duty of excise...the Commissioners may assess the amount of duty due from that person.”
Section 12(1A) and 12(4) FA 1994 provide that:
“12 Assessments to excise duty
(1A) Subject to subsection (4) below, where it appears to the Commissioners –
that any person is a person from whom any amount has become due in respect of any duty of excise; and
that the amount can be ascertained by the Commissioners, the Commissioners may assess the amount of duty due from that person and notify that amount to that person or his representative.
...
An assessment of the amount of any duty of excise due from any person shall not be made under this section at any time after whichever is the earlier of the following times, that is to say –
subject to subsection (5) below, the end of the period of 4 years beginning with the time when his liability to the duty arose; and
the end of the period of one year beginning with the day on which evidence of facts, sufficient in the opinion of the Commissioners to justify the making of the assessment, comes to their knowledge”
Sections 13A(2)(b) and 16(1B) FA 1994 provide for an appeal to the First-tier Tribunal (‘FtT’) against a decision of HMRC to raise an assessment to excise duty under s 12(1A).
Section 13A FA 1994 sets out the meaning of “relevant decision” and s 16 deals with appeals to a tribunal:
“13A Meaning of “relevant decision”
This section applies for the purposes of the following provisions of this Chapter.
A reference to a relevant decision is a reference to any of the following decisions—
…
so much of any decision by HMRC that a person is liable to any duty of excise, or as to the amount of his liability, as is contained in any assessment under section 12 above.”
In relation to appeals to the FtT, s 16 FA 1994 provides that:
“16 Appeals to a tribunal
…
(1B) Subject to subsections (1C) to (1E), an appeal against a relevant decision (other than any relevant decision falling within subsection (1) or (1A)) may be made to an appeal tribunal within the period of 30 days beginning with—
…
In relation to other decisions, the powers of an appeal tribunal on an appeal under this section shall also include power to quash or vary any decision and power to substitute their own decision for any decision quashed on appeal.”
Section 16(5) FA 1994 provides that the power of the FtT in an appeal such as the appeal before us includes the power to either quash, or vary, or substitute its own decision for any decision quashed on appeal. The FtT has no jurisdiction under s 16(5) to consider a Wednesbury unreasonableness challenge to an assessment issued on the basis that an excise duty point was triggered.
Appeal hearing
The hearing was adjourned, part-heard, on 26 September 2024, when the Appellant indicated that he wished to speak to a legal representative at the conclusion of HMRC’s evidence and submissions. At the resumed hearing on 10 December 2024, the Appellant stated that he had not been able to afford legal representation and confirmed that he was happy to proceed with the hearing. Whilst he did not have the documents with him during the resumed hearing, he had confirmed that he had received all of the documents at the part-heard hearing on 26 September 2024. The Appellant was assisted by a Polish interpreter, whom he confirmed he understood, throughout the proceedings.
Preliminary discussions
At the commencement of the appeal hearing, Ms Beegun submitted that the Appellant was liable to the Assessment because he was holding the Goods at the first duty point identified by HMRC. She added that the Assessment was not a “best judgment” assessment, and that no penalty had been applied.
Respondent’s evidence and submissions
We heard oral evidence from Officer Collingwood, who is an officer of HMRC in the Excise Post Detection Audit (‘PDA’) Team. He has worked as a compliance caseworker for the PDA Team since October 2017.
Officer Collingwood stated that when receiving the Appellant’s case, he reviewed the information provided by the Fraud Investigation Service (‘FIS’). This included the interview transcripts of the Appellant, G.A., E.W., M.M. and M.T., as well as the witness statements of Officers Evitt, Craig, Nichols, Pentelow, Kay, Readle and the notebooks of Officers Chaplin, Christmas, Colwell, Peachy, Whiting, Baker, Cook, Readle, Pentelow and Kaur. He also considered the tally records, CCTV stills, photos of the Goods and the Appellant’s phone records. On 27 October 2020, he issued the Assessment to the Appellant. He states that the Appellant did not provide HMRC with any information to help identify Vitus, whom the Appellant had claimed was involved with the delivery arrangements, and did not provide details to identify D.D. or A.L.A.
In response to questions in examination-in-chief from Ms Beegun, Officer Collingwood said that he did not view the CCTV footage from the investigations himself but considered the information provided by the FIS, as well as what was mentioned in the interview transcripts. He added that he issued the Assessment after he had reviewed the evidence from the FIS, which showed that the Appellant had arranged for the Goods to be delivered to the Premises. He concluded by saying that he was satisfied that the Appellant was in control of the Goods at the time, and that the Appellant had physical possession of the Goods when they were seized.
Under cross-examination from the Appellant, he said this:
The fact that the Appellant did not own the unit at the Premises is irrelevant. The fact that the Goods may not have belonged to the Appellant is also irrelevant. The issue is whether the Appellant can be considered to have been in control of the Goods, having organised for their delivery to the Premises.
He considered that the Appellant had stated in his interview that he was contacted by Vitus, and that he was going to receive payment for unloading the Goods. He had also considered that the Appellant had said that he arranged for the Goods to be delivered to the Premises because he had a forklift truck.
The Appellant had met the lorry driver at the docks and directed him to the Premises. He proceeded to unload the lorry and locked the unit at the Premises behind him.
In response to an allegation from the Appellant that he (Officer Collingwood) had been lying about there being a unit at the Premises, Officer Collingwood confirmed that he had not seen the Premises himself.
In response to questions from the panel, for the purposes of clarification, Officer Collingwood stated that as the Appellant was in control of the Goods, he was deemed to be in possession of the Goods. He added that this was despite the fact that the Appellant may not have been physically holding the Goods. He clarified that the Goods came into the Appellant’s control when he directed the lorry to the Premises and began to unload the Goods. As the Appellant had locked the Goods in a unit at the Premises, he was in control of the Goods. He further added that the police had to cut through the locks to gain access to the Goods. His position was, however, that whether the unit was locked or not would have made no difference to the liability that has arisen.
Officer Collingwood added that A.L.A and D.D. had also been assessed as they were present when the Goods were unloaded at the Premises. His position was that the strongest evidence was in respect of the Appellant as the Appellant had arranged for the Goods to be delivered at the Premises.
In re-examination, Officer Collingwood repeated that A.L.A. and D.D. had been found jointly and severally liable.
Mr Beegun’s submissions can be summarised as follows:
The Appellant is liable to the Assessment pursuant to reg. 10(1) of the Excise Duty Regulations because he held the Goods within the meaning of reg. 6(1)(b).  Strict liability is conferred on those persons holding goods on which excise duty has not been paid and HMRC are not required to establish whether such persons had actual, or constructive, knowledge of the goods being excise goods with unpaid duty. Where there is a strict liability for duty on a person found holding the goods, HMRC are obliged to assess. Case law has determined how to determine whether a person held goods.
The Appellant has not discharged the burden upon him to prove an identifiable excise duty point that may have occurred at an earlier point in time, or other persons who may have had greater de facto/legal control over the Goods. On the evidence available, the Appellant had de facto control over the Goods at the time the excise duty point arose. The Appellant exercised a greater degree of control over the collection and movement of the Goods than the lorry driver. The lorry driver had, according to the evidence available, made the delivery on the direction of the Appellant and his associates. The lorry driver returned to the Premises on the Appellant’s instructions.
The Tribunal has no jurisdiction to consider the adequacy of HMRC’s investigations to establish an earlier duty point and any challenge on that basis would be a matter for judicial review.
It is immaterial whether the Appellant had any right or interest in the Goods, or whether he was or should have been aware that they were subject to or had become chargeable to excise duty. There is no “innocent agent” exception in relation to “holding” for the purposes of liability to excise duty. The Appellant has not been able to establish an earlier duty point. The only possible defence that the Appellant may have had was to identify and establish an earlier duty point. For example, that the lorry driver or others had control over the Goods.
The lack of means for Appellant to pay the duty due is not a ground of appeal that can be considered by the Tribunal.
Appellant’s evidence and submissions
We heard oral evidence from the Appellant. The Appellant adopted the contents of his Notice of Appeal, and the statement/emails, dated 21 December 2021 and 16 October 2023, as being true and accurate. In his written evidence, the Appellant said this:
He has not been presented with any proof of his guilt.
He has never denied that he was at the Premises on 28 October 2019.
He was happy to receive the opportunity to earn money for honest labour. He would have called the police if he knew that the Goods were contraband. He believed that he was unloading vegetarian food.
He has been working at the port for two years and is a person of good standing.
He has a large family and his wife does not work.
In his oral evidence, the Appellant stated that he has given his full account to the authorities and he has explained how he came to unload the Goods. He added that he has co-operated with the authorities, and that he is not sure what else he can do. He further added that his background in the United Kingdom can be checked to show that he is of good standing. He concluded by saying that people who engage in criminal activity do so on a regular basis.
Under cross-examination from Ms Beegun, the Appellant accepted the following:
He agreed to earn £50 to unload the Goods because he had a forklift truck.
He used the forklift truck to unload the Goods at the Premises.
He locked the Goods in a unit or garage at the Premises (albeit that his position is that his colleagues would have had access to the keys for the locks).
He loaded some of the Goods onto a Mercedes van thereafter.
A.L.A was driving one of the vehicles at the Premises. He cannot recall seeing D.D., but possibly D.D. was also present (albeit that his position was that he is unclear if D.D. was with A.L.A. and he was of the view that D.D. may have been trying to protect Vitus).
He did not inform his employers about the arrangement to accept delivery of the Goods at the Premises (albeit hat his position was that his intention was to finish the job before the working day started).
He did not check any paperwork with the lorry driver before he took delivery of the Goods.
He directed the lorry driver to return to the Premises with the remainder of the Goods.
He did not believe that the lorry driver was involved in the arrangement over and above delivering the Goods.
In response to further questions for the purposes of clarification from the panel, the Appellant explained that Vitus had been present at the first point where he (the Appellant) met the lorry, but Vitus had been in another vehicle. He added that Vitus only spent a short amount of time at the dock. He further added that he (the Appellant) had given a lift to some of the other people who were present at the dock. He further stated that there was no particular reason why he had not informed his employers about the arrangement to accept delivery of the Goods. He concluded by saying that he and Vitus had discussed deliveries of this kind being made on a monthly basis, and that Vitus had told him that the deliveries were going to different stores but he did not enquire about why those stores could not take delivery themselves.
The Appellant’s submissions can be summarised as follows:
The Goods did not belong to him and he is innocent of any wrongdoing.
He does not earn enough money to pay the duty owed.
He gave all of the information that he had to the police and he was released without charge.
Following completion of the appeal hearing, we reserved our decision, which we now give with reasons.
Findings of fact
We have derived considerable benefit from hearing the oral evidence and the submissions, as well as from considering the written evidence. The following material facts were either accepted, admitted or proved:
The Appellant was in physical possession of the Goods at some point prior to the seizure.
By his own admission, the Appellant made an arrangement to accept delivery of the Goods and use his forklift to unload the Goods from the lorry at the Premises, without his employer’s knowledge.
The Appellant directed the lorry to the Premises.
The Appellant unloaded part of the Goods onto a vehicle that belonged to an associate of his and stored the remaining Goods in a unit at the Premises. He further secured the unit with padlocks using keys.
A number of witness statements were relied on by HMRC and the Appellant has not challenged the information included in the witness statements:
Officer Prisha Patel prepared a witness statement, dated 3 January 2020. She has been employed as an Anti-illicit Trade Product Intelligence Analyst since 21 October 2013 and has been employed as a forensics manager by Imperial Tobacco Limited since 1 October 2017. On 12 December 2019, she received a sample of the Goods and was asked to examine the sample. From her analysis, she concluded that the Goods were counterfeit.
PC Olivia Evitt has also prepared a witness statement, dated 28 October 2019. She was on duty on 28 October 2019 and arrived at the Premises at 10.30hrs. She had received information that pallets had been delivered to the wood workshop on Premises, and that the pallets were suspected of containing counterfeit goods. She added that the information received was that the Appellant had taken delivery of the Goods. She arrested the Appellant at 11.31hrs.
PC Caroline Nichols has also prepared a witness statement, dated 28 October 2019. She was on duty, in plain clothes, at King’s Lynn Police Station. She states that at 11.25hrs, she met other police officers at the Premises. At 15.15hrs, she received information that G.A. was at the unit. She informed G.A. that he was under arrest, and seized his telephone. She then arranged for him to be interviewed by HMRC.
Officer Lucy Craig has prepared a witness statement, dated 11 February 2020. Officer Craig is an Officer of HMRC working within the FIS. On 12 November 2019, between 10.37hrs and 11.39hrs, she and Officer Ben Colwell conducted a digitally recorded Voluntary Attender Interview under caution with G.A. at Kings Lynn Police Investigation Centre.
Office Louis Pentelow has prepared a witness statement, dated 21 April 2020. Officer Pentelow is an Officer of HMRC, currently working within the FIS. On 8 November 2019, between16.53hrs and 18.47hrs, he and Officer Mark Bagley conducted a digitally recorded interview under caution with E.W., at Greys Police station, Essex. On 28 November 2019, he was on duty at a Border Force storage facility. He was present for the tally of the Goods that were seized. He was assisted by Officers Kaur, Colwell, Whiting, Christmas and Jackson. He states that there were 19 pallets that were required to be tallied in total. 18 of them held a stack of 60 individual boxes. One held a stack of 46 boxes. In total, there were 1126 boxes to open and tally.
At 10.33hrs, he opened and examined the first box. The box contained 3,200 Richmond cigarettes. All other boxes examined, except for two, contained 3200 cigarettes apiece. Those two boxes only contained 3,000 cigarettes apiece. The tally was completed at 12.50hrs.  In total, across the 19 pallets, with 3,200 cigarettes in 1,124 boxes and 3000 in 2 boxes, he confirms that there were 3,602,800 cigarettes. He adds that the duty rate applied on cigarettes for the year 2019-20 is £375 per 1,000 cigarettes. Therefore, the cigarettes contained in the pallets would represent a total loss to the revenue of approximately £1,351,050.
Officer Readle has prepared witness statements, dated 12 and 13 December 2019. On 28 October 2019, she was on duty at Kings Lynn Police Investigation Centre with other HMRC officers. At 16.02hrs, she arrested the Appellant on suspicion of the fraudulent evasion of excise goods.
We have also seen the notebooks of Officers, Chaplin, Christmas, Colwell, Kaur, Peachey, Whiting, Pentelow, Cook and Readle. These set out the events on the day of the seizure, as set out in the background facts.
The following witness statements were also submitted in support of the appeal:
In his witness statement dated 26 November 2019, M.T., stated that he had arrived at his work premises at approximately 7.50hrs, on 28 October 2019. As he parked his car, he saw a forklift truck being used to unload a white refrigeration lorry. He observed that some pallets were taken off and left in front of the units and others were taken into the Premises. M.T. recognised the person using the forklift as the Appellant. M.T. had known the Appellant for two to three years by then. M.T. also witnessed the lorry driver and four other white males, all with Eastern European accents and all of whom he did not recognise. M.T asked the Appellant how long he would be as he also needed to use the forklift. He then telephoned G.A. to ask whether he knew what was happening and G.A. confirmed that he knew nothing about the delivery, or why the lorry was there. M.T. observed that once the pallets had been left at the Premises, the Appellant locked the doors to the unit with two padlocks. He then saw the lorry leave and four men left in a black SUV vehicle. M.T. then took the forklift and carried on with his work.
At approximately 10.00hrs, M.T. returned to the unit and observed that a large white van was backed up to the doors of the Premises. He observed the Appellant unloading boxes into the large white van. He also saw that the SUV with the four Eastern European looking men had returned with the white van. At 11.00hrs, M.T. saw the police car heading towards the unit. M.T then went back to the Premises and observed that the doors had been locked in a way that was not usual, and that one of the padlocks did not belong to Kai Timber, or Gus Piper Installations. M.T. did not see the Appellant at that time. A police officer then asked him whether he had the keys to the padlocks and he confirmed that he did not. The police officer asked for his consent to enter the unit, and he consented as he is in charge when G.A. is absent. M.T saw the police officers cut the locks with a bolt cutter. When they entered the unit, M.T. saw pallets which had cardboard boxes on them.
On 26 November 2019, M.M. also provided witness evidence. He confirmed that he arrived for work at approximately 7.50hrs on the 28 October 2019. Upon arrival, he stated that he saw a big arctic white lorry, and that the Appellant and three to four others were unloading from it. He stated that someone had said the loads were filled with onion powder. M.T. told him that something funny was going on and so he rang G.A. and told him that the Appellant was unloading from an arctic white lorry into the Premises. At approximately 8.10hrs, he received a call from G.A., who told him to tell the Appellant to go to work on the docks. After doing so, the Appellant replied that he would be another 15 minutes. M.M. confirmed, that there were several people around at this time (three to four people who were foreign, white males). At 8.20hrs, he observed that the Appellant had gone to work. At approximately 10.00hrs, M.M. saw a large white van arrive. The van was backed up to the unit.
As stated earlier, the Appellant has not challenged the accounts given in these statements. Having considered the witness statements in their entirety, and having regard to all of the surrounding facts and circumstances in this appeal, we are satisfied that we can place reliance on the witness statements.
We, therefore, make these findings of fact.
Discussion
The Appellant appeals against an Assessment to excise duty, in the sum of £1,109,311. The Appellant’s case is that he was innocent of any wrongdoing as he believed that he was unloading vegetarian food, and not tobacco, at the time that he was observed unloading the Goods. He further states that he cannot afford to pay the amount due under the Assessment.
HMRC submit that the Appellant is liable to the Assessment because he was “holding” the Goods within the meaning of reg. 6(1)(b) of the Excise Duty Regulations, and that he was a person who had handled the Goods. HMRC further submit that the Appellant was able to control access to the Premises at which the deliveries took place.
“Excise duty” is an indirect tax charged on specific goods deemed to be harmful to public health, and is chargeable in addition to customs duty. Excise duty applies inter alia, to alcohol, tobacco products, gambling activities and hydrocarbon fuels (consumption tax). Excise duty is charged when goods subject to excise duty are produced and imported, unless duty suspension arrangements apply to them. The duty falls at the time when goods leave any “duty suspension arrangement”. Excise goods subject to duty must, generally, be held in a tax warehouse operated by an authorised warehouse keeper. If duty suspension arrangements do not apply, then chargeability to excise duty is deferred until the goods depart from a duty suspension arrangement.
The identity of the person liable to pay the duty depends on the circumstances in which chargeability arises. The person liable to pay the duty is the person “holding” the excise goods at the time. The Assessment in this appeal was raised under s 12(1A) FA 1994. The discretion to assess conferred upon HMRC under s 12(1A) is limited. The boundaries of the discretion found in s 12(1A) are those contained in s 12(4). There are no words to be found in the legislation which confer a general supervisory jurisdiction over the HMRC’s exercise of discretion: C & E Comrs v J H Corbitt (Numismatists) Ltd [1981] AC 22, at 60H-61A (Lord Lane). Section 154(2)(a) CEMA provides that where in any proceedings relating to customs or excise any question arises as to whether or not any duty has been paid or secured in respect of any goods, then, where those proceedings are brought by or against HMRC, the burden of proof shall lie upon the other party to the proceedings.
The FtT has power to review decisions of HMRC in a number of administrative areas which are specified in Schedule 5, FA 1994. These decisions are referred to, collectively, as “ancillary matters”. Section 16(4) FA 1994 confers a limited jurisdiction on the FtT to examine the reasonableness of ancillary decisions, but with very limited powers to give effect to such findings. It would not allow the FtT, or the Upper Tribunal (‘UT’), to quash the decision appealed against: CC&C Ltd. v R & C Comrs [2015] 1 WLR 4043 (‘CC&C Ltd’), at [16]. Assessments to duty are not ancillary decisions. As the Court of Appeal in CC&C Ltd, observed, at [15] to [16], (per Underhill LJ with whom Lewison and Arden LJJ agreed), s 16(4) deals with management decisions involving some element of subjective assessment.
The jurisdiction invoked by the Appellant’s appeal to the FtT was under s 16(5), and not that under s16(4). In this respect, the FtT has a full appellate jurisdiction: Butlers Ship Stores v HMRC [2018] UKUT 58 (TCC) (‘Butlers Ship'), at [150].
Whether the Appellant is liable to the Assessment (whether he was holding the Goods)
There is no definition of “holding” in the Excise Duty Directive or the Excise Duty Regulations. As Parker J observed in Taylor v Wood [2013] EWCA Crim 1151, at [29]:
“‘Holding’ is not defined in the Finance Act or in the Regulations, there appears to be no authority on its meaning. It is plain that it denotes some concept of possession of the goods.”
The term and the Excise Duty Regulations, generally, must be interpreted in the context of the Excise Duty Directive and its objectives. A contextual interpretation which takes into account the purpose of the legislation is necessary. The Court of Appeal in Taylor v Wood also said this:
…Possession is incapable of precise definition; its meaning varies according to the nature of the issue in which the question of possession is raised (a good example being Re Atlantic Computer Systems plc [1990] BCC 899, CA). But it can broadly be described as control, directly or through another, of the asset, with the intention of asserting such control against others, whether temporarily or permanently: see, for example, Goode on Commercial Law, Fourth Edition, p 46. In a case of bailment, the bailee has actual, or physical, possession and the bailor constructive possession. In other words, if the bailee holds possession not for any interest of his own but exclusively as bailee at will, legal possession will be shared by bailor and bailee.
In this case Heijboer had physical possession of the cigarettes at the excise duty point, but Heijboer was acting as no more than the agent of the primary carrier, Yeardley. Yeardley was, therefore, in law the bailee of the cigarettes at the excise duty point and, not apparently having any interest of its own in the goods, shared legal possession with the person having the right to exercise control over the goods, as explained above. If Yeardley had known, or perhaps even ought to have known, that it had physical possession of the cigarettes at the excise duty point, its possession might have been sufficient to constitute a “holding” of the cigarettes at that point. However, Yeardley had no such knowledge, actual or constructive, and was entirely an innocent agent. That important fact then turns the focus on the person or persons who were exercising control over the cigarettes at the excise duty point. There is no doubt that Wood (through Events) was such a person. Wood, as a matter of fact, under the contract with Yeardley gave instructions throughout the transportation to the carrier. Wood was correctly shown on Yeardley’s invoice to be Yeardley’s client and the consignee of the goods that were being transported. Under the Convention, as a matter of law, Wood (through Events) had the legal right of control over the goods. It is also known that Taylor (through TG) was acting together with Wood in exercising control over the cigarettes throughout the transportation. TG was shown on the CMR to be the consignee, a designation which represented accurately, if incompletely, the true state of affairs. There is no good reason to distinguish the position, in this context, of the two appellants.”
Physical possession of goods is not, therefore, required for a person to be holding those goods. Although the law has moved on as regards innocent agents, in deciding whether the Appellant was holding the Goods, the issue for us to decide is whether the Appellant was the person who was exercising control over the Goods at the duty point.
The question of whether a person can be said to be “holding” goods has been the subject of much consideration and adjudication, which we have considered. The sphere of litigation that has most recently arisen began with B & M Retail Ltd v HMRC [2016] UKUT 429 (TCC) (‘B & M Retail’).
B & M Retail
In B & M Retail, the UT decided that a person holding excise duty goods in respect of which duty had not been paid could be assessed under reg. 6(1)(b) of the Excise Duty Regulations. This was notwithstanding the fact that, in principle, an earlier release for consumption had occurred.  Such a scenario did not preclude HMRC assessing a person holding excise duty goods in respect of which excise duty had not been paid. The decision as to which of the various persons that had held the goods should be subject to excise duty assessment was found to be at the discretion of HMRC.
Following the decision in B & M Retail, the UT handed down the decision in Davison & Robinson Ltd v R & C Comrs [2018] UKUT 437 (TCC) (‘Davison & Robinson’).
Davison & Robinson
The case presented on behalf of the appellant in Davison & Robinson was that B & M Retail was wrongly decided. Further, and alternatively, the appellant argued that the issue of whether there could be more than one excise duty point should be referred to the Court of Justice of the European Union (‘CJEU’). The UT held that:
We have already dealt with the first of these propositions. As regards the second proposition, the need to ensure that unpaid excise duty is collected when goods have been released for consumption requires HMRC, as the Upper Tribunal found in B&M, to make an assessment once it has established that an excise duty point has occurred. Clearly, HMRC cannot make an assessment until it has the necessary information on which to establish when, how, where and by whose acts the excise duty point occurred. Therefore, in the absence of any relevant information in relation to any prior release for consumption, HMRC must assess the person who it finds to be holding the goods in question, since that is the only excise duty point which HMRC is able to establish.”
The UT ruled that HMRC has no discretion as to who to assess where there have been multiple holders of the goods and excise duty had not been paid. All that HMRC are required to do is to assess the person they find to be holding the goods in question, if that is the only excise duty point which can be established.
The UT observed that HMRC cannot make an assessment until they have the necessary information on which to establish when, how, where and by whose acts the excise duty point occurred. The correct position is that if there was someone who HMRC had sufficient information to assess, then HMRC had to assess that person irrespective of the prospects of recovery. The question of whether HMRC should pursue a person liable at an earlier duty point was not one of discretion.
The UT ultimately endorsed HMRC’s acceptance that they were obliged to assess, as a matter of law and not merely discretion, against “the earliest point in time at which they are able to establish, on the evidence before them, that excise goods have been held outside a duty suspension arrangement” (at [79]). That was consistent with the UT’s analysis that the Excise Duty Directive required an assessment to be made against the first established excise duty point.
If HMRC assessed anyone other than the first holder they could identify, it would be open to that person to challenge the assessment on appeal to the FtT ([80]).
The next relevant case was that of HMRC v Perfect [2019] EWCA Civ 465.
Perfect
Mr Perfect was stopped by UK Border Force at Dover Docks whilst driving a lorry containing pallets of beer, in respect of which excise duty had not been paid. Mr Perfect knew that he was carrying beer, but did not know (i) who owned the lorry; (ii) that duty had not been paid; and (iii) that the documentation which accompanied the load related to a previous consignment. The lorry and the goods were seized. Although HMRC accepted that the evidence did not show that Mr Perfect was actively involved in the attempts to smuggle goods into the United Kingdom, or that he deliberately attempted to evade excise duty, he was assessed for excise duty on the basis that he was holding the goods.
Both the FtT and the UT had found that Mr Perfect could not be held liable for the unpaid excise duty on the goods. On appeal to the Court of Appeal, the court accepted that where the driver is the only identifiable person who can be assessed, the opportunity for smuggling and fraud would be manifestly greater if the courts and tribunals conclude that he cannot be assessed if he was unaware that the goods were liable to duty. The court further held that the natural meaning of the words “holding” or “making delivery” do not impute any requirement for the person to be aware of the tax status of the goods. At [22] (Newey LJ with whom Baker and Snowden LJJ agreed), the court found that “knowledge” or “means of knowledge” is irrelevant to liability. The court, therefore, approved the conclusions of the UT, in Davison & Robinson. The court further commented that the EU principles of proportionality and fairness did not exclude the imposition of strict liability.
The Court of Appeal in Perfect concluded thus:
It follows that the fact that Mr Perfect had neither actual nor constructive knowledge of the smuggling of the beer he was carrying cannot exempt him from liability from excise duty.”
The case was referred to the CJEU, given the fundamental importance of proportionality in EU law. The Court of Appeal noted in Perfect, at [66] to [67], (and repeated at [10] of the Court of Appeal’s further judgment in the case following a CJEU reference (R & C Comrs v WR Case C-279/19 (‘WR’): at [2022] 1 WLR 3180), that:
We agree that the underlying policy of the 2008 Directive is, as identified by the Upper Tribunal in B & M, that it is the obligation of every member state to ensure that duty is paid on goods that are found to have been released for consumption. It would be a distortion of the internal market were member states not to take steps to ensure that goods in respect of which excise duty should have been paid cannot circulate freely within the single market alongside goods on which duty has been paid. ...
This policy is, to our eyes, reflected in the terms of the Directive and the Regulations. ... Although fairness and proportionality are, of course, cornerstones of EU law, as they are of the common law, they do not invariably exclude the imposition of strict liability. We consider that there is very considerable force in the argument that, given the policy underlying the Directive, the imposition of strict liability on a driver in these circumstances does not offend the principles of fairness or proportionality.”
Mr Perfect could not provide any other details of who owned the goods. That is, ultimately, why he was found liable.
The principle of ensuring the collection of tax was recognised by Baker LJ in the Court of Appeal when it first considered Perfect in 2019, and again by Newey LJ when it subsequently applied the CJEU determination of the question.
WR
In WR, it was argued that commercial chaos would follow if a delivery driver, who, while they knew or ought to have known the goods were excise goods did not know they were duty unpaid, was still found liable. Rejecting the concern, the Advocate General considered that the undertaking rather than the driver would be liable, contrasting the employed status of the delivery driver in the example with the taxpayer’s status as a self-employed entrepreneur.
The CJEU held, at [24] to [25], that:
The concept of a person who ‘holds’ goods refers, in everyday language, to a person who is in physical possession of those goods. In that regard, the question whether the person concerned has a right to or any interest in the goods which that person holds is irrelevant.
Moreover, there is nothing in the wording of Article 33(3) of Directive 2008/118 to indicate that the status of person liable to pay the excise duty, as being ‘the person holding the goods intended for delivery’, depends on ascertaining whether that person is aware or should reasonably have been aware that the excise duty is chargeable under that provision.”
And at [27] to [31]:
…the person liable to pay the excise duty is, in accordance with Article 8(1)(b) of that directive, ‘the person holding [those] ... goods and any other person involved in the holding of the excise goods’.
However, like Article 33(3) of Directive 2008/118, Article 8(1)(b) of that directive does not contain any express definition of the concept of ‘holding’ and does not require the person concerned to be the holder of a right or to have any interest in relation to the goods which that person holds, or that that person be aware or that he should reasonably have been aware that the excise duty is chargeable under that provision.
By contrast, in a situation different from that referred to in Article 33(3) of Directive 2008/118, that is to say, in the case of an irregularity during a movement of excise goods under a duty suspension arrangement, within the meaning of Article 4(7) of that directive, Article 8(1)(a)(ii) of that directive provides for liability to pay the excise duty on the part of any person who participated in the irregular departure of those goods from the duty suspension arrangement and who, furthermore, ‘was aware or who should reasonably have been aware of the irregular nature of the departure’. The EU legislature did not restate this second condition, which can be regarded as requiring an element of intention, either in Article 33(3) or, moreover, in Article 8(1)(b) of that directive (see, by analogy, judgment of 17 October 2019, Comida paralela 12, C-579/18, EU:C:2019:875, paragraph 39).
It follows that, where, in Directive 2008/118, the EU legislature intended that an intentional element be taken into account for the purpose of determining the person liable to pay the excise duty, it has laid down an express provision to that effect in that directive.
Furthermore, an interpretation limiting the status of person liable to pay the excise duty as being ‘the person ... holding the goods intended for delivery’, within the meaning of Article 33(3) of Directive 2008/118, to those persons who are aware or should reasonably have been aware that excise duty has become chargeable would not be consistent with the objectives pursued by Directive 2008/118, which include the prevention of possible tax evasion, avoidance and abuse (see, to that effect, judgment of 29 June 2017, Commission v Portugal, C-126/15, EU:C:2017:504, paragraph 59).”
[Emphasis added]
The CJEU summarised this as reflecting the intention of the EU Legislature to lay down a broad definition of the persons liable to pay excise duty on goods released for consumption in order to ensure that so far as possible that the duty is collected (at [33]).
And, at [34], the CJEU said this:
However, to impose an additional condition requiring that the ‘person ... holding the goods intended for delivery’, within the meaning of Article 33(3) of Directive 2008/118, is aware or should reasonably have been aware that excise duty is chargeable would make it difficult, in practice, to collect that duty from the person with whom the competent national authorities are in direct contact and who, in many situations, is the only person from whom those authorities can, in practice, demand payment of that duty.”
Therefore, a person may be said to be “holding” goods for the purposes of reg. 10(1) of the Excise Duty Regulations if they are in “physical possession” of the goods. It is irrelevant whether that person has any right or an interest in the goods. It is also irrelevant whether or not that person is or should be aware that the goods are subject to or have become chargeable to excise duty.
The CJEU concluded, at [36], that:
“...a person who transports, on behalf of others, excise goods to another Member State, and who is in physical possession of those goods at the moment when they have become chargeable to the corresponding excise duty, is liable for that excise duty, under that provision, even if that person has no right to or interest in those goods and is not aware that they are subject to excise duty or, if so aware, is not aware that they have become chargeable to the corresponding excise duty.”
While that passage was about art. 33 of the Excise Duty Directive - implemented in the Excise Duty Regulations by reg. 13 - the Court of Appeal in Dawson’s had confirmed the meaning of “holding” had the same meaning through the directive and this therefore applied to reg. 6(1)(b).) This determination was acknowledged subsequently by Newey LJ in the Court of Appeal decision in Perfect, at [22], in which the CJEU interpretation in WR was applied.
At [43], the Advocate General said this:
“The normal meaning of the words “holding” and “making the delivery” of goods used in the Directive is clear; they require only physical possession of the goods, In view of the absence of divergence in this respect between the various language version of the text, it may be concluded that the expression ‘person holding the goods” covers anyone who is in physical possession of them unless that interpretation is contradicted by the purpose of the provision or by general principles of law.”
Physical possession was not, however, an issue in that case as it was not in dispute and the referral to the CJEU assumed that the holder was in physical possession.
The agreement between the United Kingdom and the EU setting out the arrangements for the UK’s withdrawal from the EU (‘the Withdrawal Agreement’) Treaty Series No. 3 (2020) provides for judgments of the CJEU handed down after 31 December 2020 to have “binding force in their entirety on and in the United Kingdom if given in respect of references made by the United Kingdom before the end of 2020.
The requirement for a “holder” to have physical possession was considered in more detail in Dawson’s (Wales) Ltd v HMRC [2019] UKUT 0296 (TCC) (‘Dawson’s’).
Dawson’s
The case concerned a wholesaler of alcoholic drinks. HMRC assessed that it owed around £3,700,000 of excise duty on the basis that there was insufficient evidence that excise duty had been paid on certain supplies of goods made and physically held by it. HMRC traced the supply-chain back from Dawson’s supplies to missing, de-registered or hijacked companies. Dawson’s was assessed because HMRC had no evidence that excise duty was paid on the goods and could not establish that any of the companies appearing further back in the supply-chain took physical possession of the goods. The court, similarly, held that the starting point in determining who is “holding” the goods at the relevant time must be the person who has physical possession of them. Once the physical holder of the goods is identified, the correct approach is to then consider whether the circumstances of that possession are such that it is inappropriate for that person to be considered to be holding the goods.
The UT’s decision in Dawson’s revolved around the issue of whether control involved physical possession (as HMRC argued), or included de jure or de facto control over the goods, even if the person did not have physical possession (as the taxpayer there argued to advance their case that HMRC should have assessed a person at an earlier duty point). Pending CJEU decision in WR, the UT in Dawson’s proceeded on the basis of various propositions, at [131], derived from various other authorities before it, which included that an “innocent agent” of the person with de jure or de facto control was not holding, but that actual or constructive knowledge of physical possession of duty unpaid excise goods could take someone out of the status of an innocent agent.
The UT went on to note that, while none of the authorities had covered the situation where physical possession had not been established, they did require - when seeking to establish that a person without physical possession of goods could be regarded as their holder - establishment of the basis on which it was said that legal or de facto control of the goods was said to arise, at [136]. Thus, the issue of whether there was sufficient control in order to be “holding” had been highlighted as a key factor.
The UT summarised the matters that a person would have to show in order to successfully challenge an assessment on the basis that an earlier duty point could be established against which HMRC should have made an assessment (at [149]):
Who had physical possession at the time the alleged earlier excise duty point occurred?
Who is the person alleged to have de facto or legal control over the goods who it is said should be assessed rather than the subsequent holder and how that person is said to have such control and the basis on which it was being exercised?
The time at which the excise duty point arose. (The UT’s view was that the date of an invoice was not sufficient in itself without establishing who was in possession of the goods at some identified point or points in time.)
Where the goods were being held at the relevant time.
On appeal, the Court of Appeal in Dawson’s ([2023] 4 WLR 35), at [77], the court endorsed (1) (physical possession). Asplin LJ considered that that was supported by the CJEU’s decision in the WR and “the touchstone was the physical possession of the excise goods”. The court also endorsed points (3) and (4) (timing and location) (at [94]) and noted that (2) (regarding de facto or legal control) was not challenged ([86]); the burden of proof being on the party seeking to challenge the assessment: see [74] and [94] of the Court of Appeal’s decision in Dawson’s.
At [68], Asplin LJ confirmed this specifically in relation to the meaning of “holding” when commenting on the earlier decision in Taylor v Wood:
“The court approached the question of “holding” at paras 29-30 solely from the perspective of domestic law. The concept of “holding” arises, however, in the Excise Directive (and the 1992 Directive before it) and is a principle of EU law which must be approached through that lens. As the UT pointed out at paras 93-94 of its decision, it is a well established principle that when interpreting a provision of EU law, it is necessary to consider not only the wording of the provision but its context and aims and that a term such as “holding” should have an autonomous meaning; Kingscrest Associates Ltd v Customs and Excise Comrs (Case C-498/03) EU:C:2005:322; [2005] STC 1547. Legislation implementing a provision of EU law must then be interpreted, so far as possible, in conformity with EU law, thus interpreted. That was not the approach which the Court of Appeal Criminal Division adopted”
The Court of Appeal held, at [76], that:
“... Anyone in physical possession of excise goods who was assessed for excise duty would immediately point to the chain of supply and contend that there must have been an earlier release for consumption and a person in de facto or legal control of the goods before them and, accordingly, that they were not liable”.
However, the circumstances and de facto and/or legal control of the goods must also be a factor to be considered. The court concluded that it is also possible for a person with control over the goods, as opposed to physical possession, to be treated as holding them. This is as a result of an absence of an earlier duty point. The court, however, found that it was up to the person assessed to establish that a person earlier in the supply-chain had been holding the goods and should be assessed instead. The court stated that in the absence of any evidence that establishes an earlier duty point, the person holding the goods at the time that it is established that the goods are being held at a specific location, but are no longer held pursuant to a duty suspension arrangement, is chargeable to the unpaid duty.
Asplin LJ went on to state, at [78], that:
“As the Advocate General pointed out in the Perfect case, the meaning and scope of terms for which EU legislation does not provide a definition must be determined by reference to their usual meaning in everyday language whilst taking into account their context and the purpose of the rules in question. Furthermore there can be no doubt that “holding” must be given a consistent meaning in all Member States and throughout the Excise Directive. Nothing turns therefore upon the point that the Perfect case was concerned with the meaning of “holding” for the purposes of article 33 rather than article 7(2)(b). There is also no question but that the HMDP Regulations must be interpreted in conformity with the Excise Directive.”
The Court of Appeal also considered that the UT in Dawson’s had been correct to rely on the passage at [67] in Davison & Robinson, regarding HMRC not being able to make an assessment unless it had the necessary information (at [83] to [84]). The approach of the UT and Court of Appeal in Dawson’s demonstrates that the determination of “holding” is a question of law and fact.
Dawson’s, and the majority of cases considered in it, including Perfect, involve persons arguing that they should not be assessed to duty simply on the basis of having physical possession of excise goods.
Hartleb
The UT in Agniezska Hartleb t/a Hartleb Transport v HMRC [2024] UKUT 00034 (TCC) (‘Hartleb’) agreed with HMRC that a haulage company employer was “holding” the goods in the particular circumstances of her case, despite her argument that it was her employee driver who had physical possession of the goods and not her. The UT considered, at [78], the four factors identified by the UT in Dawson’s regarding the need to establish an earlier duty point to be a useful guide in determining who to regard as “holder” in circumstances where physical possession and de facto and/or legal control were separated, as they were on the facts of the case before it.
As regards physical possession, the UT explained that was not determinative ([80]) and that a more detailed consideration of the facts was needed ([81]). Referencing the approach taken by the UT in Dawson’s (at [143]), the UT in Hartleb held that it was consistent with the legislation and caselaw to adopt an approach which established first, who had physical possession of the goods, but then considered whether the circumstances of that possession were such that it was inappropriate for that person to be considered to be “holding” the goods ([83]).
The UT found that the circumstances of the haulier’s direction and control over her employee outweighed his actual physical possession of the goods. The UT held that:
The approach of the UT and Court of Appeal in Dawson demonstrates that the determination of “holding” is a question of law and fact. Although the initial focus, given the location of goods so giving weight to physical possession – that is not the end of the matter and a more detailed consideration of the facts is needed.
...
As the UT commented in Dawson it is consistent with the legislation and case law to adopt an approach that establishes first who has physical possession of the goods but then considers whether the circumstances of that possession are such that it is inappropriate for that person to be considered to be “holding” the goods (see [143] of the UT judgment).”
The appellant in Hartleb had directed her employee to deliver goods in accordance with an arrangement that she had made with the manufacturer of the goods. At [90], the UT held that:
“On this straightforward combination of facts we consider it legally correct and consistent with the operation of the Excise Directive and so the HMDP Regulations to treat the Appellant and not her employee as holder. Put simply, the circumstances in which the Appellant had control outweigh the fact that physical possession of the excise goods was with her employee.”
The UT’s analysis in Hartleb, and its suggestion that the factors explored in Dawson’s relevant to establishing whether someone was liable at an earlier duty point (which included control) were also useful to consider when examining whether someone was “holding” ([15]), show how the issue of control is one of a number of factors that fall to be considered when looking at whether it is inappropriate to consider someone with physical possession as “holding”.
Turton
Whilst not binding on us, the FtT in Turton v HMRC [2021] UKFTT 0441 (TC) (‘Turton’) considered the application of WR in an appeal concerning the application of reg. 10 of the Excise Duty Regulations and said this:
According to the definition in WR, a person can be “holding” duty unpaid cigarettes for purposes of the 2008 Directive and the 2010 Regulations, both in circumstances (1) where the person knows that the goods they are holding are cigarettes or unspecified excise goods but does not know that they have become chargeable to any excise duty or that the excise duty has not been paid, and (2) where the person does not even know that the goods they are holding are cigarettes or unspecified excise goods. This is evident from the questions on which the Court of Appeal of England and Wales requested a preliminary ruling, and the wording of the preliminary ruling given by the CJEU. The Court of Appeal asked whether a person could be liable to excise duty in circumstances where that person “knew that the goods he was in possession of were excise goods but did not know and did not have reason to suspect that the goods had become chargeable to excise duty ... at or prior to the time that they became so chargeable”. The Court of Appeal then asked whether the answer to this question would be any different if the person did not know “that the goods he was in possession of were excise goods”. (See WR at [20]). The CJEU answered these questions by stating that the person could be liable to excise duty both (1) where the person was “not aware that [the goods] are subject to excise duty”, and (2) where the person was aware that the goods are subject to excise duty but was “not aware that they have become chargeable to the corresponding excise duty”.”
Turning to the circumstances of the appeal before us:
Having considered all of the documentary and oral evidence, cumulatively, we are satisfied that the Appellant held the Goods. We give our reasons for so finding:
We have found that by his own oral evidence, the Appellant entered into an arrangement to receive, unload and store the Goods at the Premises. Whilst surveillance evidence was obtained by the police and handed over to HMRC, and whilst Officer Collingwood did not personal view this evidence, the Appellant readily admits to his role on the day of the seizure. We have found that the Appellant used his forklift to unload the Goods having directed the lorry driver to the Premises. At this point, the Appellant was in physical possession of the Goods.
The Appellant clearly also had direction and control over the Goods at this point. Once the Goods were in the Premises, the Appellant proceeded to lock the Goods away. The person who had access to the unit at this point was the Appellant. The Appellant was, therefore, able to control access to the Premises, where collection took place: Van De Water v Staatssecretaris van Fianciën [2001] All ER (D) 53 and Hughes v HMRC [2022] UKFTT 00400 (TC).
The Appellant reloaded some of the Goods onto a van and they were then taken to Peterborough. The Appellant readily admits that his employer did not have any knowledge of the arrangement that was in place. Furthermore, his employer was not present on the morning that the Goods were delivered by the lorry driver. This is not, therefore, a case where the Appellant’s employer can be said to have had greater control over the Goods. Indeed, the Appellant’s evidence was that he hoped that the delivery would be complete before the working day started (which would be before his employer had arrived). The Appellant remains a person identified as exercising control over the Goods at the earliest duty point identified by HMRC. The Appellant remains liable for the excise duty on the Goods he was holding even if it is the case that other people, who might also be liable with him, might also be assessed if they were also identified.
By his own oral evidence, the Appellant did not believe that the lorry driver was involved in the arrangement concerning the Goods. In respect of the other people who were present, the Appellant denied having seen D.D., despite D.D. being with A.L.A. Both D.D. and A.L.A have been held jointly and severally liable and they have not appealed against the assessments issued against them. The Appellant does not deny knowing D.D. and he failed to mention in interview that he knew that D.D. was present on the day of the seizure. During his interview, A.L.A. referred to having seen D.D. speaking to the Appellant. We find that it would be quite remarkable for the Appellant not to have seen D.D. when the undisputed evidence is that the Appellant loaded some Goods onto the van that D.D. and A.L.A were travelling in.
Despite referring to Vitus, the Appellant was said not to have provided any real assistance in establishing how to get hold of Vitus, and was considered to have been vague and inconsistent during his interview. During the hearing before us, the Appellant was still unable to shed any further light on Vitus’ whereabouts. The Appellant has not been able to establish an earlier duty point other than that which came to light at the Premises.
The Appellant described the arrangement that he entered into as being one where he believed he could made “honest labour”. We find that there is considerable force in Ms Beegun’s submission that the Appellant displayed “wilful ignorance” in this respect. Whilst it may be the case that the Appellant did not know what he was getting involved in, the unintended consequences of any decision not to exercise due diligence are that the Appellant is unable to evade liability.
It is settled law that the fact that the Appellant may not have had any right to the Goods, or knowledge that duty had not been paid, is irrelevant. Caselaw further establishes that there is no “innocent agent” defence. The Appellant is strictly liable to the Assessment. Having considered the authorities and the evidence, and on this straightforward analysis of the facts, we hold that the Appellant is liable for the unpaid duty because he was holding (within the meaning of the Excise Duty Regulations) the Goods delivered to the Premises. Furthermore, we find that the Appellant was able to control access to the Premises, upon which the collections took place.
The purpose of the Excise Duty Directive is to cast the net wide because to do otherwise would risk frustrating its purpose, leaving the excise duty system exposed to fraud, evasion or abuse. The objective (legitimate aim) of HMRC’s powers to issue assessments is to secure the payment of excise duty which is owed. The use of such powers is appropriate to achieving that aim where a person holding goods is assessed at the first assessable duty point. We accept that the reasonable inference that can be drawn from the evidence is that the Appellant held excise goods.
The Appellant has raised his impecuniosity as a reason for being unable to pay the Assessment. Section 8(5) FA 1994 however provides that:
Neither of the following matters shall be a matter which the Commissioners or any appeal tribunal shall be entitled to take into account in exercising their powers under subsection (4) above, that is to say-
the insufficiency of the funds available to any person for paying any duty of excise or for paying the amount of the penalty;
the fact that there has, in the case in question or in that case taken with any other cases, been no or no significant loss of duty.”
The principle of fairness and proportionality is specifically addressed in the Tribunal’s decision of the FtT in Charlene Hughes v HMRC [2022] UKFTT 00400 (TC), at [77]:
“Whilst the Tribunal has every sympathy for the Appellant’s personal circumstances.... and accepts that the assessment may be financially ruinous, none of those matters are grounds for allowing an appeal against an assessment.”
The burden of proving that an earlier duty point can be established lies on the person seeking to resist the Assessment. In this appeal, that person is the Appellant. We find that the Appellant has failed to do so. Our findings and conclusions are based on a balanced appraisal of all of the facts.
Conclusions
On the basis of our findings above, we hold that:
The Appellant is liable to the Assessment because he held the Goods within the meaning of reg. 6(1)(b) of the Excise Goods Regulations.
A person may be said to be “holding” goods for the purposes of the Excise Duty Regulations if they are in “physical possession” of the goods.
The word “held” must be given an ordinary and natural meaning, with an eye to preventing fraud. It does not require one to have been “caught red-handed”.
It is irrelevant whether the Appellant has any right or an interest in the Goods, and it is also irrelevant whether or not the Appellant is, or should be, aware that the Goods were subject to or have become chargeable to excise duty.
“Knowledge”, or “means of knowledge”, is irrelevant to whether an individual is liable or not.
Accordingly, therefore, the appeal is dismissed.

DECISION
Introduction
The Yorkshire Agricultural Society ( the “Society”) is a charity which organises and runs the annual Great Yorkshire Show. The Society considered that its supplies of admission to the show in 2016 and 2017 were exempt supplies for value added tax (“VAT”) purposes. HMRC disagreed, and refused the Society’s claim for repayment of overpaid VAT for 2016, and issued an assessment to VAT for 2017 in respect of the supplies claimed to be exempt.
The Society appealed to the First-tier Tribunal (Tax Chamber) (the “FTT”). In a decision released on 25 April 2023 (the “Decision”), the FTT allowed the Society’s appeal against both the 2016 repayment claim and the 2017 assessment. The Appellants (“HMRC”) do not appeal against the decision regarding the 2017 assessment, but now appeal the decision regarding the 2016 repayment claim.
factual background
There is no dispute as to the facts in this case, and the following summary is taken from the Decision. References in the form FTT[x] are to paragraphs of the Decision.
Since it is only the 2016 repayment which is the subject of this appeal, we are concerned only with the facts relating to the Show in that year, even though the FTT made findings in relation to the 2017 Show. The parties agreed that that should not have any material impact on our decision. References below to the Show are to the 2016 Show.
The Society was founded in 1837. It is a membership organisation with more than 12,000 members, a charitable company limited by guarantee and a registered charity. Its charitable objects are as follows:
To support and promote agriculture, rural and allied industries throughout the North of England, including championing the role of farmers as providers of high quality produce and encouraging consumers to choose healthy and local produce.
To advance and encourage agricultural research and greater understanding and empathy with farming and the countryside amongst the general public and particularly children.
To advance and encourage the protection and sustainability of the environment.
To hold in pursuance of its main objectives an annual agricultural show.
On the basis of written evidence, management accounts of the Society and evidence from the Society’s Financial Controller, Mr Stoddart, the FTT set out certain findings of fact at FTT[42]:
On the basis of the above, and Mr Stoddart's evidence, which we accept, we find:
The Society's activities, done pursuant to its charitable purposes, include promotion of the existence and work of the Society generally. This is increasingly important to the Society because, historically, the Society and the Show were two completely different 'brands': the Show was very well-known and high-profile, but the Society much less so. The Society was and is trying to increase its prominence and profile as a society per se, and as an organisation which does more than just run the Show;
The Society's activities, done pursuant to its charitable purposes, also include the promotion of public awareness in farming, and supporting farmers;
(3) It holds the Show as one way in which to fulfil its charitable purposes;
The Society undertakes fundraising. The task of fundraising is one for the Society's board of trustees. There is no fundraising committee, but Mr Stoddart attends the board of trustees;
The overall budget for the Show is set by Mr Stoddart and the Society's Chief Executive;
There is a planning team for the Show, led by a ""Show Director"", whose work is overseen by the board of trustees;
One of the main tasks of the Show's planning team is to consider how to raise as much money as possible from the Show, which is part of raising as much money as possible for the Society to give away through its charitable activities;
The Show is budgeted to make a surplus, and has always been managed with that in mind;
For 2016, the income generated by the Show was approximately £3.463m (being principally composed of £1.483m admissions, £1.114m trade stand fees and £220,000 stock and sundry entry fees) with expenditure incurred directly or proportionally in respect of the show (being principally composed of site costs, personnel costs, displays, prizes, printing and publicity, staff costs) being approximately £2.025m, thereby generating a surplus of approximately £1.437m;
…
The Society pays to put the Show on, as well as paying for some of the permanent infrastructure at the Showground, which is used all-year round and not just during the Show;
The Show usually runs for 3 days in mid-July, from 7.30 in the morning to 7.30 in the evening (with a 6.30 close on the last day). In 2016 it ran from Tuesday 12 - Thursday 14 July…
The Show is well-attended. Attendance at the Show is capped at 35,000 a day; this being about 20,000 ticket sales, and 15,000 other people on the site such as exhibitors, stewards, and other staff (such as gate staff/security, car-parking marshals, catering and sanitary staff);
The whole Show is stewarded by about 300-350 unpaid volunteers who, amongst other tasks (such as helping get animals into the show-ring in the right sequence) go around helping people, and giving more information on a one-to-one basis.
During the Show, the Site is split up into several 'zones';
The 'Discovery Zone' is aimed at children. Its main aim is to educate people about what goes on in the countryside, and to encourage them to find out more. It holds a number of workshops, for example showing how rapeseed oil is produced from seeds, a butcher showing how meat is butchered; bread-making and other 'hands-on' activities;
The showing of livestock (cattle, sheep, pigs and goats) is one of the main attractions of the Show, bringing animals from across the whole UK. It is not just a competitive exercise, but itself is something done to promote best practice in rearing animals, including animal wellbeing;
Many of the activities at the Show - showing livestock, equine activities such as show-jumping, sheep-shearing, and gun-dog demonstrations - are accompanied by live commentary, which is descriptive and educative - for example, the commentary will say what is happening, why it is done, and what the judges are looking for;
There are some 'trade' and rare-breed stalls. The latter are 'hands-on' and allow people to stroke the sheep (for example);
The food zone includes not only things such as a cheese show, but also demonstrations of cookery in a cookery theatre;
The motor zone is principally a demonstration of modern agricultural machinery such as tractors and trailers, but also has auto-dealer trade stands where it is possible to buy a vehicle.
The FTT also set out the following findings of fact which are important in this appeal, at FTT[43]-[46]:
The Appellant accepts - in its Grounds of Appeal - that it did not ""promote"" the 2016 Show as being ""primarily"" for the raising of money.
Mr Stoddart's evidence was that (i) the Society putting the Show on, and (ii) the Society spending money on its charitable aims, were 'entwined'. He said that ""you cannot do one without the other"", by which he meant (as we understand it, and to paraphrase), without the money from the Show itself, there would be no Show at all. He also said that there were two purposes to the Show: fundraising, and education.
We accept that evidence.
It is also consistent with contemporary documentary evidence.
relevant legislation
The only issue in this appeal is the applicability of a particular exemption from VAT to certain supplies by the Society in connection with the Show.
The relevant domestic provisions derive from EU legislation, namely Article 132 of the Principal VAT Directive 2006/112/EC (the “PVD”). Title IX of the PVD sets out various exemptions. Article 131 of the PVD states as follows:
The exemptions provided for in Chapters 2 to 9 shall apply without prejudice to other Community provisions and in accordance with conditions which the Member States shall lay down for the purposes of ensuring the correct and straightforward application of those exemptions and of preventing any possible evasion, avoidance or abuse.
Chapter 2 is headed “Exemptions for certain activities in the public interest”. The relevant parts of Article 132 state as follows:
1 Member States shall exempt the following transactions:
…
the supply of services and goods, by organisations whose activities are exempt pursuant to points (b), (g), (h), (i), (l), (m) and (n), in connection with fund-raising events organised exclusively for their own benefit, provided that exemption is not likely to cause distortion of competition;
…
2 For the purposes of point (o) of paragraph 1, Member States may introduce any restrictions necessary, in particular as regards the number of events or the amount of receipts which give entitlement to exemption.
Article 131 provides as follows:
The exemptions provided for…shall apply without prejudice to other Community provisions and in accordance with conditions which the Member States shall lay down for the purposes of ensuring the correct and straightforward application of those exemptions and of preventing any possible evasion, avoidance or abuse.
In domestic legislation, VAT exemptions are dealt with by section 31 Value Added Tax Act 1994 (”VATA”), which states, in section 31(1), that “a supply of goods or services is an exempt supply if it is of a description for the time being specified in Schedule 9”.
Group 12 of Schedule 9 VATA is headed “Fund-raising events by charities and other qualifying bodies”. Item 1 of Group 12 provides exemption for:
The supply of goods and services by a charity in connection with an event—
that is organised for charitable purposes by a charity or jointly by more than one charity,
whose primary purpose is the raising of money, and
that is promoted as being primarily for the raising of money.
Note 11 to Group 12 states as follows:
Items 1 to 3 do not include any supply the exemption of which would be likely to create distortions of competition such as to place a commercial enterprise carried on by a taxable person at a disadvantage.
The exemption for fund-raising events by charities contained in Item 1 of Group 12 was enacted in its present form, with effect for supplies made after 1 April 2000, by the Value Added Tax (Fund-Raising Events by Charities and Other Qualifying Bodies) Order 2000, SI 2000/802. Particularly since certain of the relevant authorities deal with the earlier wording, which we refer to below as the “pre-2000 provision”, it is necessary to set out that earlier wording.
Group 12—Fund-Raising Events by Charities and Other Qualifying Bodies
Item No
1 The supply of goods and services by a charity in connection with a fund-raising event organised for charitable purposes by a charity or jointly by more than one charity.
2 The supply of goods and services by a qualifying body in connection with a fundraising event organised exclusively for its own benefit.
Notes
For the purposes of items 1 and 2 “fund-raising event” means a fête, ball, bazaar, gala show, performance or similar event, which is separate from and not forming any part of a series or regular run of like or similar events.
the decision and the grounds of appeal
The FTT decided that the 2016 Show was exempt from VAT under Item 1 of group 12 (“Item 1”).
In relation to the three sub-paragraphs of Item 1, it was common ground that sub-paragraph (a) was satisfied as the Show was organised for charitable purposes by a charity. The FTT decided that sub-paragraph (b) was satisfied, because the primary purpose of the Show was the raising of money. The FTT considered that “the primary purpose” should be read as referring to “a” primary purpose, and that a primary purpose meant one which was important. Alternatively, the FTT considered, the purpose of fund-raising was interdependent with the purpose of charitable education. The FTT decided that sub-paragraph (c) was also satisfied,   when that requirement was interpreted in conformity with the PVD.
We discuss the FTT’s reasoning and conclusions in detail below. At FTT [139]-[141] the FTT summarised its conclusions as follows:
CONCLUSIONS ON ITEM 1
Item 1(a) is met. The Show in 2016…was organised for charitable purposes by a charity.
Item 1(b) is met on the footing:
Fund-raising is one of two inter-dependent purposes, but was the main purpose of the Show; or
Even if not, then it was a main purpose of the Show, in the proper sense of the exemption.
Item 1(c) is met, on the footing that the Show was promoted for fund-raising purposes:
Item 1(c) in its entirety is an incorrect transposition of the Directive into UK law (Loughborough); or
The use of the word 'primarily' in Item 1(c) is an incorrect transposition, and falls to be deleted (Marleasing) (Footnote: 1).
The FTT refused HMRC’s application for permission to appeal. The Upper Tribunal (Judge Jones) granted HMRC permission to appeal on two grounds.
Ground 1 is that the FTT erred in law in its interpretation of Item 1(b).
Ground 2 is that the FTT erred in law in its interpretation of Item 1(c) and wrongly excised either the whole of (c) or the word “primarily” from the statutory wording.
The Society did not provide any Respondents’ Notice.
We informed the parties at the hearing that we wished to receive further submissions from them on a number of issues, and issued directions to that effect. Those further submissions were very helpful, and we have taken them into account in reaching our decision.
the eu law position in summary
We directed the parties to attempt to agree a joint note setting out the current position regarding the applicability of EU law to the appeal. The note produced by the parties records that since the appeal concerns a dispute over the taxability of supplies made in 2016, prior to the UK’s withdrawal from the EU, and a claim of VAT in respect of the Show which was made in 2020, during the Implementation Period, the parties agreed that the applicable law is that which was in place pursuant to European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (“EUWA”) at the end of the Implementation Period (that is, in accordance with the retention of EU law as it existed immediately prior to the end of the Implementation Period).
ground 1: item 1(b): an event “whose primary purpose is the raising of money”
The FTT’s decision
The FTT began its consideration of this issue by referring to the FTT decision of Judge Kempster in Loughborough Students Union v HMRC [2018] UKFTT 357 (TC) (“Loughborough FTT”). The FTT stated that it agreed with Judge Kempster that “Item 1(b) refers to “a” primary purpose, and not “the” primary purpose, and that a primary purpose means a purpose which is important”: FTT[84].
The FTT considered that this accorded with a purposive reading of the exemption. It then stated that it also chimed with the approach taken by earlier tribunals in relation to the pre-2000 provision, in Blaydon Rugby Football Club v Commissioners of Customs and Excise [1996] V & DR 1 (“Blaydon”) and Newsvendors Benevolent Institution v Commissioners of Customs and Excise (1996) VAT Decision 14343 (“Newsvendors”).
The FTT referred to HMRC’s internal guidance on the exemption to support its conclusion that the promotional and advertising material for the Show sufficed to show that the “main and overriding purpose” of holding the event was fund-raising.
The FTT determined that Item 1(b) was satisfied for the following reasons, at FTT[92]-[96]:
Therefore, taken overall, in our view:
Fund-raising was not the exclusive purpose of the Show;
The Show had two main purposes: (i) fund-raising, and (ii) education.
We cannot sensibly rank these in order of importance, and neither party sought to advance any analysis which would enable a ranking of purposes to be empirically, reliably and/or sustainably undertaken on the facts of this case.
Overall, our impression is that it could not be said that either of these purposes was more important than the other. In that sense, looked at in the round, the two purposes are of equal importance. Beyond that, it seems to us that the two purposes not only co-exist, but are interdependent, and not independent.
If fund-raising were not taken as a discrete purpose, but were taken as being one of two inter-dependent purposes, then, in our view, it was the main purpose of the Show, and it qualified for the exemption.
In fund-raising were taken as a discrete purpose, then it was a main purpose of the Show, and it qualified for the exemption.
It is first necessary to unpack the FTT’s decision. We consider that this passage records a decision that the event satisfied Item 1(b) on one or both of two alternative bases.
The first basis is that fund-raising was not a discrete purpose; rather, the two main purposes of the Show were fund-raising and education, which were of equal importance and were inter-dependent, forming a single purpose which satisfied Item 1(b), even on HMRC’s construction.
The second basis is that if fund-raising was taken as a discrete purpose, it was one important purpose of the Show, even though it was not the only or primary purpose, and that was sufficient to satisfy the exemption, properly construed.
This reading is consistent with the FTT’s summary of its conclusion on Item 1(b), at FTT[140]:
Item 1(b) is met on the footing:
Fund-raising is one of two inter-dependent purposes, but was the main purpose of the Show; or
Even if not, then it was a main purpose of the Show, in the proper sense of the exemption.
Therefore, in order for HMRC to succeed on Ground 1, they must establish that the FTT erred in law in relation to both of these alternative conclusions.
HMRC’s arguments
For HMRC, Ms Mannion said that the nub of the issue is whether Item 1(b) requires an event which has a single primary purpose of fundraising, or whether it can be satisfied, as the FTT decided, by an event for which one of the important purposes is fundraising. In HMRC’s submission, the FTT was wrong in law, because Item 1(b) plainly requires a single identifiable primary purpose.
Ms Mannion made the following points:
The language of Item 1(b), particularly given the established need for VAT exemptions to be construed strictly, supports HMRC’s position.
Blaydon supports HMRC’s interpretation. While Newsvendors and Cheltenham and Gloucester College of Higher Education Students’ Union v Commissioners of Customs and Excise [1998] (1998) VAT Decision 16727 (“Cheltenham”) arguably support the FTT’s interpretation, those decisions relate to the pre-2000 provision, which is differently worded.
Properly read, Loughborough FTT in fact supports HMRC’s interpretation.
As regards the FTT’s conclusion that the main purposes of fundraising and education were “entwined”, that conclusion was founded on and undermined by the FTT’s flawed legal analysis.
As a matter of law, Item 1(b) requires a determination of any separate purposes for the event, followed by a determination of the single primary purpose. There cannot be an “intertwined” primary purpose.
Applying Item 1(b) correctly, the FTT’s findings of fact, and the Society’s own case, meant that the requirement was failed.
Item 1(b):Approach to construction
Both before the FTT and in this appeal the parties were agreed that the construction of Item 1(b) is to be determined by reference to the words used, because it is not ultra vires the PVD, and does not require a conforming interpretation.
Item 1 is an exemption. The correct approach to the construction of VAT exemptions was recently considered by the Supreme Court in Target Group Ltd v HMRC [2023] UKSC 35 (“Target”). While case law establishes that VAT exemptions are to be construed “strictly”, it is necessary to understand what that means. In particular, it does not mean that an exemption must be construed in a narrow or restricted way. In Target, Lord Hamblen, delivering the judgment of the court, said this, at [17]-[18]:
The following points are of relevance…
The exemptions contained in the PVD (and formerly the Sixth Directive) are independent concepts of EU law.
The terms used in the PVD to specify exemptions must be interpreted strictly because they constitute exceptions to the general rule that VAT is to be levied on all services supplied for consideration by a taxable person.
…
What is meant by a strict interpretation was explained by Chadwick LJ in Expert Witness Institute v Customs and Excise Comrs [2001] EWCA Civ 1882, [2002] 1 WLR 1674, [2002] STC 42 as follows:
… A ‘strict’ construction is not to be equated, in this context, with a restricted construction. The court must recognise that it is for a supplier, whose supplies would otherwise be taxable, to establish that it comes within the exemption; so that, if the court is left in doubt whether a fair interpretation of the words of the exemption cover the supplies in question, the claim to the exemption must be rejected. But the court is not required to reject a claim which does come within a fair interpretation of the words of the exemption because there is another, more restricted, meaning of the words which would exclude the supplies in question.”
A “strict” construction also requires account to be taken of the underlying purpose of the exemption in question. In Canterbury Hockey Club C-253/07, the CJEU stated, at paragraph 17 of its decision:
The terms used to specify the exemptions under Article 13 of the Sixth Directive are to be interpreted strictly, since they constitute exceptions to the general principle that VAT is to be levied on all supplies of services for consideration. However, that requirement of strict interpretation does not mean that the terms used to specify those exemptions should be construed in such a way as to deprive them of their intended effect (Temco Europe, paragraph 17, and Horizon College, paragraph 16). They must be interpreted in the light of the context in which they are used and the scheme of the Sixth Directive, having particular regard to the underlying purpose of the exemption in question (see, to that effect, Temco Europe, paragraph 18, and Case C428/02 Fonden Marselisborg Lystbådehavn [2005] ECR I1527, paragraph 28).
Discussion
The statutory requirement is that the Show is “an event…whose primary purpose is the raising of money”.
The FTT dealt first (as shall we) with the second basis on which it concluded that this requirement was satisfied, namely that on a proper construction this wording requires only that fund-raising was one important purpose of the event.
Looking first at the language used, we agree with HMRC that it does not support the FTT’s construction. That construction effectively relies on three conclusions. The first is that “primary” mean “main”, the second is that “main” means important, and the third is that there can be more than one primary purpose to an event.
Mr Firth’s skeleton argument asserted that it was common ground that “primary” and “main” are synonymous (Footnote: 2). Ms Mannion filed a supplementary note which stated that this was not correct. HMRC’s position is that main can have a wider meaning than primary and, most importantly, that primary may be synonymous with “the main”, but it is not the same as “a main”. HMRC further dispute that “main” means merely “important”.
We broadly agree with HMRC’s position. While “the primary purpose” may in general have the same or a similar meaning as “the main purpose”, both main and primary are words which describe something more than importance. A secondary or incidental purpose, which is neither the main nor the primary purpose, may nevertheless be an important purpose.
In concluding that a primary or main purpose simply means a purpose which is important (at FTT[84]), the FTT stated that it was agreeing with the conclusion to this effect by Judge Kempster at [86] of Loughborough FTT. In fact, there is no such conclusion at [86] of Loughborough FTT or elsewhere in that decision. Mr Firth argued that authority for the proposition is found in Travel Document Services v HMRC [2018] EWCA Civ 549 (“Travel Document Services”). We do not agree. The only reference to that issue in that decision is to record a bare assertion by counsel to that effect (Footnote: 3).
We also consider that the FTT erred in concluding that Item 1(b) contemplates multiple primary purposes, and is satisfied if one of those purposes is fund-raising. In reaching that conclusion, the FTT’s reasoning was as follows:
That construction was adopted in Loughborough FTT.
On a purposive reading, “confining the exemption to something where fund-raising is the foremost (ie first-in-rank) purpose is both unnecessarily restrictive, and inconsistent with the Court of Appeal’s guidance on the scope of exemptions…”: FTT[85].
That approach corresponded to the approach taken in Blaydon and Newsvendors.
In relation to Loughborough FTT, the FTT referred to the statement at [85] of that decision that “a primary purpose of fundraising is a fair interpretation of the legislative wording in Article 132(1)(o)”. However, in our opinion that puts too much weight on the use of the word “a”, and more importantly, fails to take into account the remainder of the decision. In fact, Judge Kempster preferred the approach in Blaydon, which broadly endorses HMRC’s interpretation, and said at [58] that “a “fundraising event” is an event the main purpose of which is to raise funds”. At [62], Judge Kempster also said this:
I am aware that the VAT Tribunal in Cheltenham & Gloucester (Dr Brice) came to a different conclusion; there it was found (at [19]) that fundraising was not the primary purpose of any of the five student balls in dispute but nevertheless all the 15 balls were fundraising events within Group 12 (to reiterate, this was on the pre-2000 statutory wording). I have read carefully but respectfully disagree with the VAT Tribunal’s reasoning and conclusion on that point. I agree that fundraising need not be the sole purpose of an organised event but if fundraising is not the main purpose of the event then I consider it is not a fundraising event, it is instead merely an event which has the incidental purpose of being expected to yield a surplus.
Judge Kempster described the statement on which the FTT relied as following from his conclusions at [56]-[64], which include the passages we have set out, and it would be inconsistent with those conclusions for the statement to bear the meaning ascribed to it by the FTT. The FTT’s reliance on Loughborough FTT was, therefore, misplaced.
The FTT stated that its approach was consistent with Blaydon and Newsvendors, which “drew a qualitative dividing line between ‘the main purpose’ and a ‘merely incidental purpose’”: FTT[86]. However, neither of those decisions addressed the point which the FTT determined, namely whether Item 1(b) encompassed multiple primary purposes. In fact, the tribunal in Blaydon stated (at page 3) that “…a “fundraising event is an event the main purpose of which is to raise funds”. While Newsvendors and Cheltenham did not take the same approach, all of Blaydon, Newsvendors and Cheltenham concerned the pre-2000 provision, which differs from Item 1(b). In Loughborough Students Union v HMRC [2013] UKUT 517 (TCC) (“Loughborough UT”), the Upper Tribunal specifically referred to the difference in wording, signalling that the pre-2000 authorities cannot simply be read across to Item 1(b). It said this, at [55]-[56]:
Mr Tallon [counsel for the taxpayer] referred us to Newsvendors Benevolent Institution v Customs and Excise Commissioners (1996) VTD 14343 in which the VAT and Duties Tribunal said, at [25], that:
“… the exemption in Article 13A(1)(o) and in Item 1 of Group 12 is not limited to events the main purpose of which is to raise funds. Both provisions refer to ‘a fund-raising event” and do not specify that fundraising must be the main purpose of the event.”
As will be obvious to the attentive reader, the version of Item 1 of Group 12 quoted above and with which this appeal is concerned does specify that fund-raising must be the primary purpose of the event. The Tribunal in Newsvendors Benevolent Institution was discussing an earlier version of Item 1 of Group 12. In April 2000, Item 1 of Group 12 was amended to include the primary purpose conditions. Mr Tallon relies on Newsvendors Benevolent Institution for the statement that the exemption in Article 13A(1)(o) is not limited to events the main purpose of which is to raise funds.
Mr Tallon also referred us to Cheltenham & Gloucester College of Higher Education Students Union v Customs and Excise Commissioners (1998) VTD 15727 in which a differently constituted VAT and Duties Tribunal followed the line taken by the Tribunal in Newsvendors Benevolent Institution.
We consider that Blaydon and Newsvendors did not support the FTT’s analysis.
The FTT further stated that it considered HMRC’s interpretation of Item 1(b) to be unnecessarily restrictive and inconsistent with case law guidance as to the interpretation of VAT exemptions. We do not consider that the case law guidance which we have set out above in relation to the construction of VAT exemptions supports the interpretation adopted by the FTT of the clear statutory language. Taking into account the context and underlying purpose of the exemption, an event “whose primary purpose is the raising of money” cannot permissibly be construed as describing an event of which one important purpose is the raising of money.
In conclusion, we consider that the FTT erred in law in construing Item 1(b) as describing an event of which one important purpose was fund-raising.
We turn to the FTT’s alternative basis for deciding that the Show satisfied Item 1(b). This was that fund-raising should not be viewed as a discrete purpose but as one of two equally important and inter-dependent purposes, which were the main purpose of the Show.
The FTT’s main findings of fact on this issue are set out at FTT[44]-[46]:
Mr Stoddart's evidence was that (i) the Society putting the Show on, and (ii) the Society spending money on its charitable aims, were 'entwined'. He said that ""you cannot do one without the other"", by which he meant (as we understand it, and to paraphrase), without the money from the Show itself, there would be no Show at all. He also said that there were two purposes to the Show: fundraising, and education.
We accept that evidence.
It is also consistent with contemporary documentary evidence.
Ms Mannion’ skeleton argument submitted that this approach was impermissible because it was “founded on and undermined by” the FTT’s error of law in relation to the first alternative, namely its conclusion that Item 1(b) permitted multiple main purposes.
We do not agree. We consider that the FTT was here reaching a conclusion that if it was necessary to determine the single primary purpose of the Show, as a matter of fact it was wrong to separate the purposes of fund-raising and education. Moreover, the FTT concluded, it was not possible to “sensibly rank” those purposes to determine which was most important. This alternative analysis was a different approach to the construction of Item 1(b), which was not dependent on or infected by the error of law which we have found in relation to the FTT’s first approach.
In her oral submissions, Ms Mannion argued that this alternative analysis was not permissible, because as a matter of law it is necessary in applying Item 1(b) first to find all the separate purposes of an event and then to find which of those purposes was the single primary purpose. That process, she said, did not permit a finding that purposes were intertwined or inseparable. In response to a question, Ms Mannion stated that if as matter of fact it was found that two purposes were equally important, then there would be no primary purpose.
We do not consider that Ms Mannion’s restrictive approach to ascertaining the primary purpose of an event is justified. The requirement that the primary purpose is “the raising of money” should be interpreted in context and taking into account the purpose of the exemption in Item 1. As Mr Firth correctly pointed out, in raising money at an event a charity is very likely to be doing so in the context of an intention to advance its charitable purposes, and, as Mr Firth put in in his skeleton argument, “it makes no sense to exempt events intended to raise funds to pursue the charity’s objectives but to exclude exemption if the same event actually pursues those charitable objectives”.
Looking at Item 1(b) in context, by virtue of Item 1(a) the exemption is applicable only if the event is one “that is organised for charitable purposes by a charity…”. In our opinion, the FTT was entitled to conclude that the requirement in Item 1(b) was not failed in a situation where, as a matter of fact, the primary purpose of the event consisted of fund-raising which was inextricably intertwined with the furthering of the charity’s charitable purposes. Put another way, Ms Mannion’s interpretation produces the curious result that an event can only fall within both (a) and (b) if it is organised for charitable purposes but not primarily for charitable purposes.
The alternative basis on which the FTT found that the Show satisfied Item 1(b) was     dependent on its findings of fact in this particular case, which we have set out above, which were clearly open to it on the evidence.
We should mention that Ms Mannion sought to challenge the FTT’s decision, at FTT[87], to reject HMRC’s argument that because an annual show is regular and not “exceptional”, it cannot be a fund-raising event within the exemption. The FTT was, in our opinion, entitled to regard the annual nature of the event as a relevant factor into account in its assessment, but without affording it significant weight.
We consider that the alternative basis on which the FTT reached its conclusion that the Show satisfied Item 1(b) was one which was available to it as matter of statutory construction and on the particular facts found in this case.
HMRC’s appeal in relation to Ground 1 is dismissed.
ground 2: item 1(c): an event “that is promoted as being primarily for the raising of money”
The FTT’s decision
The FTT began by stating as follows, at FTT[107]:
In its Grounds of Appeal, the Appellant accepts that it did not promote the Show in 2016 as being ""primarily"" for the raising of money.
Having set out Article 132(1)(o) of the PVD, the FTT then observed, at FTT[109]:
The Directive does not contain - either expressly, or by way of necessary implication - any requirement than an event be promoted primarily for the raising of money. The only qualification is that the exemption ""is not likely to cause distortion of competition"".
The FTT noted that in Loughborough FTT, Judge Kempster concluded that Item 1(c) was incompatible with the Directive , but that the incompatibility could be “cured” by interpreting it in a conforming manner in accordance with the Marleasing principle. The FTT agreed with this conclusion. The FTT stated that the parties agreed that (1) the FTT should continue to interpret and apply VATA as it would have been interpreted and applied prior to the UK leaving the EU, and (2) domestic law is to be interpreted so as to conform with EU law: FTT[118]-[119].
In Loughborough FTT the FTT concluded that that Item 1 could be read in a conforming manner so as to be compliant with the PVD by omitting Item 1(c) in its entirety. The FTT agreed with the analysis and decision of Judge Kempster and adopted it. However, the FTT noted that it would have reached the same result by deleting the word “primarily” in Item 1(c), rather than the entire sub-clause: FTT[128].
The FTT stated at FTT[131]:
In this appeal, Judge Kempster's reading, or our alternative reading, would each have led to an identical outcome, because the Show - as HMRC in the course of its submissions accepted - was promoted for the raising of money, even if not primarily…
The FTT expressed concern at the lack of clarity in HMRC’s case as to what compliant promotion would actually have looked like. It considered that HMRC’s approach was “self-evidently unworkable, either by taxpayers or HMRC, and gives no certainty to either”: FTT[133].
The FTT summarised its conclusion at FTT[141]. This was that the Show satisfied Item 1(c) either because Item 1(c) in its entirety was an incorrect transposition of the Directive into UK law, and should be deleted, or because the word “primarily” was an incorrect transposition and should be deleted.
HMRC’s arguments
As it was before the FTT, HMRC’s primary position in this appeal is that Item 1(c) is not ultra vires the PVD, so that the question of a conforming interpretation does not arise.
Ms Mannion submitted that the FTT erred in law in reaching the contrary conclusion, both in adopting the approach in Loughborough FTT and in its own alternative approach of disapplying the word “primarily”. HMRC were unable to challenge the conclusion regarding Item 1(c) in Loughborough FTT itself , because they were the successful party overall in the appeal, but, said Ms Mannion, HMRC consider that it was wrong.
HMRC’s position is that Item 1(c) is permissible under the Directive because it is an “evidential tool” to ensure that the relevant event complies with Item 1(n), as being an event whose primary purpose is the raising of funds.
Ms Mannion argued that such a condition is permissible under Article 132(2) of the PVD, which permits Member States to introduce “any restrictions necessary” for the purposes of the exemption. Alternatively and in addition, it is permissible under Article 131 for the purpose of ensuring the correct and straightforward application of Article 132(1)(o), and avoiding abuse of the exemption.
If we do not accept HMRC’s primary position, Ms Mannion argued that in any event the FTT’s alternative conforming interpretations of Item 1(c) each overstepped the permissible limits of Marleasing. They amounted to giving direct effect to Article132(1)(o), and there had been no argument in this case that it had direct effect.
Relevant EU law principles
The joint note produced by the parties stated that the parties agreed on the following principles:
VATA 1994 has effect in relation to this appeal in the same way that it had effect immediately prior to IP completion day (EUWA 2018, s.2), including effects as a result of interpretation or disapplication.
The REULA [Retained EU Law (Revocation and Reform) Act 2023] amendments and [Finance Act] 2024 savings in respect of VAT have no application to this appeal, because the relevant events occurred before the end of 2023 (REULA 2023, s.22(5)) and, in any event, the claim accrued prior to that time (see, by analogy, Lipton, as regards causes of action accruing under EU regulations before UK Withdrawal (Footnote: 4)).
The parties suggest that this claim accrued in 2016 when the VAT return containing the relevant output tax, which the Appellant says was overpaid, was submitted (or, in the alternative at the date of the claim for overpayment in 2020). For the purposes of this appeal the outcome is the same, because the cause of action would have been carried through by the EUWA, and REULA/s.28 FA2024 do not apply in relation to anything occurring before the end of 2023.
CJEU authorities decided before 31 December 2020 remain binding on this Tribunal (i.e. including Marleasing). CJEU authorities decided after that date are not binding, but regard may be had to them (s.6 (1), (2) (7) EUWA).
Further, s.6(3) EUWA provides that any question as to the validity, meaning or effect of retained EU law (i.e. VATA), is to be decided, insofar as the law is unmodified after IP Day (as is the case with Item 1 of Group 12), in accordance with any retained case law and retained general principles of EU law.
The principle of the supremacy of EU law continues to apply in this appeal, so far as relevant to the interpretation, disapplication or quashing of law made before IP Completion Day (i.e. VATA) (s.5(2) EUWA, pre-REULA amendment/s.28 FA 2024 savings).
Directly effective rights, if any, arising from the Principal VAT Directive continue to apply in relation to this appeal, only insofar as permitted by EUWA s.4(2)(b) (pre REULA amendment).
We accept and adopt this summary of the principles relevant to this case.
Issues raised
The following issues arise in relation to Ground 2:
Is Item 1(c) ultra vires Article 132(1)(o)?
If it is ultra vires, is it possible to adopt a Marleasing interpretation of Item 1(c) which would result in it conforming with the PVD? In particular, were the conforming interpretations adopted by the FTT permissible under Marleasing principles?
If Item 1(c) is ultra vires the PVD but a conforming interpretation is not possible, does Article 132(1)(o) have direct effect?
Is Item 1(c) ultra vires the PVD?
Article 132(1)(o) provides that Member States shall exempt certain supplies by charities “in connection with fund-raising events organised exclusively for their own benefit, provided that exemption is not likely to cause distortion of competition”.
It is common ground that Item 1 of Group 12 is compliant with Article 132(1)(o) in restricting exemption to an event that is organised for charitable purposes by a charity and whose primary purpose is the raising of money (sub-paragraphs (a) and (b) of Item 1). However, as the FTT correctly pointed out, there is no indication in the language of Article 132(1)(o) that it is necessary in addition for the event to be “promoted as being primarily for the raising of money” (the “promotion condition”).
In establishing whether or not Item 1(c) infringes the PVD, we must first construe Item 1(c) using normal domestic principles of construction: CG Fry and Son Ltd v SSLHC [2024] EWCA Civ 730 at [74]. Those principles include that the language must be construed in context and with regard to the purpose of the legislation.
In our opinion, the determination of whether or not the promotion condition conforms with the PVD depends largely on the purpose and function of the promotion condition.
In Loughborough FTT, having concluded that Item 1(b) was not ultra vires Article 132, Judge Kempster said this, at [86]:
Secondly, the condition in Item 1(c) that the event must be promoted as being primarily for the raising of money. Again, this is not explicitly provided in art 132(1)(o). I assume (I heard no submissions on this specific point) the purpose of this condition is to ensure that persons attending (or planning to attend) a fundraising event are aware that it is such an event, and so they regard themselves as benefactors of the organisation rather than mere customers of the goods and services provided at the event. If that is the purpose behind the condition then I consider the restriction is unwarranted. If a charity organises a fundraising event (say, a jumble or nearly-new 20 sale of donated items) then the motivation of customers (benefactors or bargain hunters) does not, I consider, affect the character of the event as a fundraiser. Accordingly, I conclude that Item 1(c) is an unwarranted restriction on the availability of the exemption, and thus is ultra vires art 132(1)(o).
Ms Mannion said that HMRC did not accept that Judge Kempster had properly described the purpose of the promotion condition. It followed that the FTT had erred in law in following Loughborough FTT on this issue.
HMRC’s position in relation to purpose and function is as follows:
Item 1(c) is an essential aspect of the legislative definition of a fund-raising event, and provides the evidential tool to ensure that Item 1(b) is complied with, by requiring that the event is promoted in accordance with the primary purpose of raising funds. Ms Mannion’s skeleton argument states that Item 1(c) “allows HMRC (and anyone else) to easily appreciate that the event is one which is designed to fundraise for charitable objects (per Item 1(b)), not simply make a commercial or even an incidental profit”.
Such a condition is permitted by Article 132(2), as a restriction necessary for the purposes of the exemption, understood in terms of the need to construe the exemption strictly.
Additionally, the promotion condition operates to ensure the correct and straightforward application of the exemption and to avoid abuse, as permitted by Article 131.
In relation to the “evidential tool” argument, we accept that the way in which a charity promotes or advertises an event would in practice be one element of the relevant evidence in assessing whether or not Item 1(b), and for that matter Item 1(a), were satisfied on the facts. However, the promotion condition goes much further than that. It singles out one area of relevant evidence and elevates it to a distinct condition for the exemption. The question is whether such an additional restriction on the availability of the exemption is within the terms of the exemption which Member States must implement under Article 132(1)(o). Article 132(1)(o) addresses the status of the supplier, the need for an event, the purpose of the event, the need for it to be organised exclusively for the benefit of the charity, and the need to avoid distortion of competition. The exemption does not identify or address the purpose for which a qualifying event is promoted.
Ms Mannion’s suggestion that the promotion condition allows HMRC and others to easily appreciate the purpose of the event seems to us to echo the purpose suggested, somewhat speculatively, by Judge Kempster, but which HMRC have rejected as part of their case.
Where an event is found as a matter of fact to be both organised for charitable purposes by a charity and to have as its primary purpose the raising of money (as required by sub-paragraphs (a) and (b)), HMRC have not demonstrated any justifiable basis on which that event should then fall outside the exemption in Article 132(1)(o) purely because it was not promoted as being primarily for raising money.
Ms Mannion argued that the promotion condition was justified under Article 132(2). This allows Member States to introduce “any restrictions necessary” for the purposes of Article 132(1)(o). We reject that argument, for the following reasons.
While the words “any restrictions necessary” are wide, they are not to be construed in isolation. Article 132(2) itself refers to “any restrictions necessary, in particular as regards the number of events or the amount of receipts which give entitlement to exemption”. The reference to the number of events and amount of receipts is not exhaustive, but it is indicative of the types of condition which might be considered to be “necessary”. An example of such a condition can be found in the definition of “fund-raising event” in the pre-2000 provision, which referred to an event “which is separate from and not forming any part of a series or regular run of like or similar events”. Another example is set out in Notes 4 and 5 to Items 1 to 3 of Group 12, which state as follows:
Where in a financial year of a charity or qualifying body there are held at the same location more than 15 events involving the charity or body that are of the same kind, items 1 to 3 do not apply (or shall be treated as having not applied) to a supply in connection with any event involving the charity or body that is of that kind and is held in that financial year at that location.
In determining whether the limit of 15 events mentioned in Note (4) has been exceeded in the case of events of any one kind held at the same location, disregard any event of that kind held at that location in a week during which the aggregate gross takings from events involving the charity or body that are of that kind and are held in that location do not exceed £1,000.
The wording of Article 132(2) as a whole, and these examples, suggest that in determining whether a restriction to the exemption is “necessary”, the central question is whether it is necessary to avoid distortion of competition. That proposition appears to have been the view of the Upper Tribunal in Loughborough UT, at [66], and is recorded as being agreed by counsel for HMRC in that case (at [57]). If that is correct, then since HMRC has produced no evidence, beyond mere assertion, that the promotion condition is necessary in order to avoid distortion of competition, we consider that HMRC’s argument based on Article 132(2) is not made out. Indeed, as a matter of principle, we find it hard to see what relevance the promotion condition, as distinct from Items 1(a) and (b), could have to the prevention of distortion of competition.
Ms Mannion submitted that “necessary” in Article 132(2) has a wider meaning than necessary to avoid distortion of competition. However, even if that is correct, HMRC have not established on what basis the separate promotion condition would be necessary in relation to the exemption, as contrasted to being what HMRC describe as a helpful evidential tool in relation to Item 1(b). We agree with the FTT’s observations and findings to this effect, at FTT[129]-[130].
HMRC’s final argument was that the promotion condition is permitted under Article 131, which applies to all VAT exemptions, as being a condition imposed “for the purposes of ensuring the correct and straightforward application of [the exemption] and of preventing any possible evasion, avoidance or abuse”.
We reject that argument, for three reasons.
First, the correct and straightforward application of the exemption must be determined by reference to the exemption as set out in Article 132(1)(o). That is an exemption for fund-raising events organised by charities for charitable purposes. As we have explained above, we do not agree that the correct application of an exemption on those terms requires or justifies a condition relating to promotion. Further, far from ensuring the straightforward application of the exemption, in agreement with the FTT we consider that, as a practical matter, a condition requiring determination of the primary purpose for which the event is promoted introduces additional uncertainty in its application.
Second, CJEU law establishes that Article 131 does not permit conditions which narrow the subject-matter of the exemption. In Commission v Spain C-124/96, the CJEU said this in relation to the predecessor to Article 131, Article 13A(1) of the Sixth Directive 77/388/EEC, at [10]-[13]:
10 The Spanish Government, supported by the United Kingdom Government, begins by arguing that the introductory sentence of Article 13(A)(1) of the Sixth Directive shows that Member States have a wide discretion in implementing the exemptions provided for.
11 It should be observed in that regard that the conditions which may be laid down pursuant to Article 13(A)(1) of the Sixth Directive to do not in any way affect the definition of the subject-matter of the exemptions envisaged by that provision (Case 8/81 Becker v Finanzamt Munster-Innenstadt [1982] ECR 53, paragraph 32).
12 Those conditions are intended to ensure the correct and straightforward application of the exemptions and refer to measures intended to prevent any possible evasion, avoidance or abuse (Becker, cited above, paragraphs 33 and 34).
13 The argument based on the introductory sentence of Article 13(A)(1) must therefore be rejected.
We consider that the promotion condition does affect the subject-matter of the exemption since, as we have said, that exemption is an exemption for fund-raising events organised by charities for charitable purposes.
Third, HMRC’s case in relation to Article 131 is mere assertion, and that is not enough. In Quadrant Amroq Beverages SRL C-332/21, the CJEU stated as follows, at [63]:
Consequently, the Member States cannot make the application of the exemption…conditional on compliance with conditions which are not proven, by concrete, objective and verifiable evidence, to be necessary to ensure the correct and straightforward application of such an exemption and to prevent any evasion, avoidance or abuse (see, by analogy, judgment of 9 December 2010, Repertoire Culinaire, C-163/09, EU:C:2010:752, paragraph 53).
That decision, and other CJEU decisions, concern exemptions said to be justified under provisions other than Article 132(2), but we see no reason why an exemption said to be justified under Article 132(2) should not require evidence.
In conclusion, we consider that the FTT was correct in deciding that the promotion condition is ultra vires Article 132(1)(o).
A conforming interpretation of Item 1(c)
In view of our conclusion that the promotion condition is ultra vires, it is necessary to determine whether Item 1(c) can be interpreted in conformity with Article 132(1)(o). The case of Marleasing establishes that national courts have a duty to interpret domestic legislation, as far as possible, in the light of the wording and the purpose of the relevant directive in order to achieve the result pursued by the latter; in other words, in conformity with the directive.
Following the hearing we directed the parties to provide further written submissions on a number of issues, including the potential application of Marleasing to Item 1(c). In a subsequent written reply, which had not been requested by the Tribunal, Mr Firth sought to raise the argument that the permission to appeal granted to HMRC was restricted to the issue of whether Item 1(c) was compatible with the Directive, and did not extend to whether (if it was not compatible) the FTT’s application of Marleasing was permissible. We reject that argument. The relevant ground of appeal, for which permission was granted, was that “the FTT erred in law in its interpretation of [Item 1(c)] and wrongly excised it (or alternatively the word ‘primarily’) from the text of Item 1”. While HMRC’s primary case was that Item 1(c) was compatible with the Directive, this ground clearly encompasses a secondary challenge to both of the alternative conforming interpretations on which the FTT relied, and that was clear from HMRC’s skeleton argument.
The approach to be taken in applying a conforming interpretation was set out by Sir Andrew Morritt C in Vodafone 2 v Revenue and Customs Commissioners [2009] EWCA Civ 446 (“Vodafone 2”), at [37]-[38]. The relevant principles can be summarised as follows:
The obligation on the English courts to construe domestic legislation consistently with Community law obligations is both broad and far-reaching. In particular:
it is not constrained by conventional rules of construction;
it does not require ambiguity in the legislative language;
it is not an exercise in semantics or linguistics;
it permits departure from the strict and literal application of the words which the legislature has elected to use;
it permits the implication of words necessary to comply with Community law obligations; and
the precise form of the words to be implied does not matter.
The only constraints on the broad and far-reaching nature of the interpretative obligation are that:
the meaning should go with the grain of the legislation and be compatible with the underlying thrust of the legislation being construed: an interpretation should not be adopted which is inconsistent with a fundamental or cardinal feature of the legislation since this would cross the boundary between interpretation and amendment; and
the exercise of the interpretative obligation cannot require the courts to make decisions for which they are not equipped or give rise to evaluate.
Ms Mannion referred to the need first to identify precisely in what respects the domestic provision infringes EU law, before it can be decided whether a conforming interpretation is possible, relying for this proposition on statements made recently by this Tribunal in The Trustees of the Panico Panayi Accumulation and Maintenance Settlements Numbers 1 to 4 v HMRC [2024] UKUT 00319 (TCC), at [128] and [130]. Ms Mannion criticised the FTT for failing to have carried out this preliminary step.
For our part, while we agree that an acceptable conforming interpretation must identify the precise infringement and do no more than is necessary to remedy that infringement, we consider that a rigid approach whereby, as a separate step, the precise infringement must first be identified will not necessarily be the best way of approaching the issue in all cases. For the reasons set out above, we have concluded that Item 1(c) is not compatible with the PVD, and that the FTT was justified in reaching the conclusion. The next question in light of that determination is whether a conforming interpretation is possible. That will critically turn on whether or not a particular conforming interpretation goes against the grain of the legislation and crosses the line between interpretation and legislation. The proper resolution of that question will necessarily take into account the precise infringement which has been determined to arise.
A conforming interpretation must not “go against the grain” of the legislation. In Vodafone 2, reference is made in this context to “the underlying thrust” of the legislation, and the impermissibility of an interpretation which is inconsistent with a fundamental or cardinal feature of the legislation.
This constraint is sometimes referred to as prohibiting an interpretation which is “contra legem”. In Dansk Industri (DI) v Estate of Karsten Eigil Rasmussen (Case C-441/14),  Advocate General Bot defined this as follows, at paragraph 68 of his Opinion :
The Latin expression “contra legem” literally means “against the law”. A contra legem interpretation must, to my mind, be understood as being an interpretation that contradicts the very wording of the national provision at issue. In other words, a national court is confronted by the obstacle of contra legem interpretation when the clear, unequivocal wording of a provision of national law appears to be irreconcilable with the wording of a directive. The Court has acknowledged that contra legem interpretation represents a limit on the obligation of consistent interpretation, since it cannot require national courts to exercise their interpretative competence to such a point that they substitute for the legislative authority.
If applied too literally, the expression contra legem might be thought to prohibit many conforming interpretations which have been reached by the CJEU and UK courts. The terms in which the constraint is expressed in Vodafone 2 are, in our opinion, a more helpful way of framing the prohibition. We respectfully endorse the comments of the Court of Appeal to this effect in British Gas Trading Ltd v Lock and Anor [2016] EWCA Civ 983. Having summarised the passage above from the Opinion of Advocate General Bot, Sir Colin Rimer said this, at [102]-[104]:
As it seems to me, if this element of the contra legem principle as explained by the EU cases is applied at anything approaching face value, it would be likely to frustrate the possibility of a conforming interpretation in many cases…
What emerges from Ghaidan and the summary in Vodafone 2, the latter having since been endorsed by the Supreme Court in Swift and Nolan, is that the United Kingdom has dealt with the contra legem principle in a manner that is manifestly more in line with the EU objective of conforming interpretation at member state level than might be the case by anything approaching a rigid application of the principle summarised by Advocate General Bot in Dansk. When faced with the question of whether a conforming interpretation can be adopted, the courts of the United Kingdom do not confine themselves to a consideration of the literal meaning of the language that may appear to stand in their way; they approach the task by reference to the broader considerations of whether a conforming interpretation will be in line with the grain or underlying thrust of the legislation. That is an approach that ought, I would think, to attract nothing but commendation by the CJEU.
104… In my view the critical question comes down to whether the conforming interpretation of the WTR for which Mr Lock contends is or is not within the grain or underlying thrust of that legislation. If it is, I consider it ought to follow that the interpretation favoured by the tribunals below is one this court should uphold. If it is not, a conforming interpretation is not possible.
The further submissions from the parties as to the grain or underlying thrust of the relevant legislation produced similar results. Mr Firth stated that “the grain (as opposed to textual detail) of the legislation is exempting fundraising events organised by charities”. Ms Mannion stated that “the ‘purpose’, ‘grain’ or ‘thrust’ of Item 1…is, narrowly, to encourage charitable fundraising through events. It does not extend beyond that specific purpose to wider activities which further charitable purposes, or support the application of a loose or weak definition of a fundraising event to further that supposed goal”.
We consider that Ms Mannion is right to focus on the grain or thrust of Item 1 as a whole, rather than the grain or thrust of sub-paragraph (c), or (for example) the use of “primarily” in that sub-paragraph. We also agree with Mr Firth that, if the grain or thrust is considered at too granular a level, there is a risk that almost any conforming interpretation might be seen as prohibited.
In our opinion, the underlying thrust and purpose of Item 1(c) is to encourage fundraising events organised by charities for charitable purposes by providing that supplies in connection with such events are exempt.
The issue is whether the alternative conforming interpretations of Item 1(c) adopted by the FTT go against, or are inconsistent with, this underlying thrust and purpose, and cross the boundary between interpretation and amendment.
The FTT decided that there were two permissible conforming interpretations. The first, which we refer to below as Interpretation 1, is to delete sub-paragraph (c) in its entirety. The second, which we refer to as Interpretation 2, is to delete the word “primarily” from sub-paragraph (c).
We consider that Interpretation 2 is clearly preferable to Interpretation 1.
Ms Mannion argued that Interpretation 1 went beyond the type of construction permitted by Marleasing, because it entailed the wholesale deletion of one element of the definition of fund-raising event, and amounted to giving direct effect to Article 132(1)(o). Mr Firth argued that the authorities establish that the deletion of wording is not necessarily beyond the permissible limits of a Marleasing construction, and that the precise manner of such construction should not be constrained. He relied on the following passage from Vodafone 2, at [39]:
Without in any way suggesting that it is incumbent on he who contends for a conforming interpretation to spell out exactly what it is…it undoubtedly assists in the consideration of whether or not it is a permissible interpretation to see on paper how it is suggested that it would be effected, whether by interpolation, deletion, rewording or otherwise.
We do not read this passage as authority that deletion is a permissible method of conforming construction. It is simply making the uncontroversial point that being able to consider the manner of achieving a particular construction is helpful to a court or tribunal in deciding whether that construction is permissible under Marleasing principles.
We do not have to decide whether or not Interpretation 1 is permissible, because we have concluded that Interpretation 2 is permissible. A construction of Item 1(c) which requires that the relevant event is promoted as being for the raising of money, but without requiring that it is promoted as being primarily for that purpose, is, in our opinion, a permissible conforming construction. It does not go against what we have determined, or what the parties have submitted, to be the grain or thrust of Item 1. Nor is it inconsistent with Article 132(1)(o).
Ms Mannion stated in her further written submissions that “this approach was in principle permissible under Marleasing, but was not in accordance with it, because it was not effective in meeting any supposed infringement of EU law”. Ms Mannion argued that “it could only be an effective remedy if the Tribunal found that the aspect of Item 1(c) which was incompatible with the PVD is not the imposition of the promotion requirement per se, but the requirement that the event is promoted as being ‘primarily’ for fundraising”.
We do not agree with Ms Mannion’s arguments. They amount to an assertion that the only justifiable conforming interpretation would be Interpretation 1, but since Interpretation 1 goes against the grain it is not permitted. That is illogical. As explained above, we have concluded that Item 1(c) infringes the PVD. In light of that conclusion, our task is to determine whether there is an acceptable conforming construction of sub-paragraph (c), keeping in mind that such a construction should go no further than is necessary to remedy any infringement and that it must not in any event go against the grain. We have concluded that Interpretation 2 meets those requirements. That is because it is a construction which is effective in meeting the infringement, while doing no more than is necessary, and not going against the grain of Item 1.
Direct effect
Since we have decided that the promotion condition can be interpreted in a way which conforms with the PVD, we do not need to determine whether Article 132(1)(o) should be treated as having direct effect. While we did receive written submissions on this issue, it is not straightforward and we have decided that it is best dealt with in a case where it is dispositive, particularly since the issue of direct effect was not the subject of submissions before the FTT and as a consequence was not discussed in the Decision.
Item 1(c): Conclusion
We interpret Item 1(c) in conformity with Article 132(1)(o) as requiring that the event be “promoted as being for the raising of money”. On the basis of the FTT’s finding of fact at FTT[131] (set out at paragraph 67 above), the Show satisfied this requirement. Therefore, HMRC’s appeal in relation to Ground 2 is dismissed.
disposition
HMRC’s appeal against the FTT’s decision to allow the 2016 repayment claim by the Society is dismissed.

IMPORTANT NOTICE
This judgment was given in private. The court permits publication of this judgment on condition that (irrespective of what is contained in the judgment) in any published version of this judgment the anonymity of the child and members of their family must be strictly preserved. All persons, including the parents, their legal representatives, legal bloggers and representatives of the media, must ensure that this condition is strictly complied with.
Failure to do so may be a contempt of court.
H.H. Judge Marson
The original version of this judgment included the names of the child, parents, other family members and all professionals involved with the family, and specific dates were identified. This published version has been altered to preserve the privacy and anonymity of the family concerned.
To assist with understanding the anonymization of this judgment, the following key is provided:
Child 1 [C1] is the subject child of these proceedings;
MC1 is the mother of C1 and a respondent in the proceedings;
FC1 is the father of C1 and a respondent in the proceedings;
Child 2 [C2] is a non-subject child who has made allegations against FC1;
MC2 is the mother of C2;
AC2 is an aunt of C2;
Child X [CX] is a paternal half sibling to C1.
MCX is the mother of CX.
Child Y [CY] and Child Z [CZ] are maternal half siblings to C1;
FCZ is the father of CZ;
Child 3 [C3] is a non-subject child;
MC3 is the mother of C3.
The court is concerned with the welfare of a boy called C1 who is now 12 months old. C1 is the subject of proceedings brought by Sheffield City Council which has been represented at this hearing by Mr Pallo. I may refer to Sheffield City Council hereafter as “the local authority”.
C1s parents are MC1 and FC1. MC1 has been represented by Ms Cole, and any references in this judgment to ‘the mother’ are references to MC1. FC1 has been represented by Mr Taylor and likewise, references to “the father” refer to FC1.
C1 is represented by the children’s guardian, Ms Sharon Jones, who in turn has given her instructions to Mr Dodgson.
The substantive application before the court is brought by the local authority under section 31 of the Children Act 1989. It was issued following C1’s birth partly due to allegations made in March 2023 by the daughter of a friend of the mother’s called C2 who, at that date, was just 10 years old. The allegations C2 made were of sexual abuse perpetrated upon her by FC1 between August 2022 and February 2023. The father denies being the perpetrator of any sexual abuse.
There are additional findings contained within the schedule of facts pleaded by the local authority which are agreed by the parents. Those facts include the mother being the perpetrator of physical abuse to her eldest son, CY in 2009. In previous proceedings the court found on the 2010-October-1 that she was the perpetrator of an inflicted bitemark on CY’s left buttock which caused CY considerable pain. It led to CY being permanently placed in the care of the maternal grandfather. In June 2022, the mother’s second child, a son called CZ was seen with a concerning bruise to his face. The mother accepts she failed to seek appropriate medical advice in respect of this injury. It led to CZ being placed permanently in the care of FCZ in August 2022.
FC1 accepts he has exhibited behaviour in the past which is likely to be abusive to a child to witness. He accepts he struggles with his anger and punched the TV, and pulled down a wardrobe and a light shade when drunk at the home of his ex-partner, MCX who is also the mother of his daughter, CX. The father was convicted of battery arising out of an assault upon MCX in August 2017, the incident having occurred in  July 2017.
The father also has a conviction for assault occasioning actual bodily harm against another ex-partner, MC3, arising out of an incident on New Year’s Eve 2020 when he accused her of cheating on him. He was sentenced in July 2021 to a sentence of 16 weeks imprisonment suspended for 12 months together with a restraining order.
It is the allegations of sexual abuse made by C2 against FC1 which remain in dispute and this is a finding of fact hearing to establish whether those allegations are capable of being established by the local authority on the balance of probabilities. The mother, in her written submissions, does not consider FC1 could have sexually abused C2 and she has an ongoing relationship with him. The father denies them in their entirety. The children’s guardian supports the Findings being made by the court as pleaded by the local authority.
The Law
In describing the background and in the narrative parts of this judgment, I may address matters upon which the parties do not agree. I may give my findings on any disputed matters as they arise and when doing so, I apply the following principles derived from the judgment  of the former President in the case of Re X (Children)(No. 3) [2015] EWHC 3651 (Fam) Munby P. which records the relevant principles in relation to fact-finding hearings as drawn from the judgment of Baker J. (as he then was) in A Local Authority v (1) A Mother (2) A Father (3) L & M (Children) [2013] EWHC 1569 (Fam). They may be summarised as follows:
(1)    The burden of proof lies at all times with the local authority;
The standard of proof is the balance of probabilities;
Findings of fact in these cases must be based on evidence, including inferences that can properly be drawn from the evidence and not on suspicion or speculation;
Evidence cannot be evaluated and assessed in separate compartments. When considering cases of suspected child abuse the court must have regard to the relevance of each piece of evidence to other evidence and exercise an overview of the totality of the evidence in order to come to a conclusion whether the case put forward by the local authority has been made out to the appropriate standard of proof;
The opinion of experts needs to be considered in the context of all the other evidence;
The court must be careful to ensure that each expert keeps within the bounds of their own expertise;
The evidence of the parents and any other carers is of the utmost importance. It is essential that the court forms a clear assessment of their credibility and reliability;
it is common for witnesses in these cases to tell lies in the course of the investigation and the hearing. The court must be careful to bear in mind that a witness may lie for many reasons, such as shame, misplaced loyalty, panic, fear and distress, and the fact that a witness has lied about some matters does not mean that he or she has lied about everything else (see R v Lucas [1981] QB 720).
To those eight principles, the former President adds a further three points:
The legal concept of balance of probabilities must be applied with common sense;
The court can have regard to inherent probabilities but this does not affect the legal standard of proof;
The fact that a respondent fails to prove on a balance of probabilities an affirmative case that s/he has chosen to set up by way of defence, does not of itself establish the local authority's case.
""It is the local authority that seeks a finding that FM's injuries are non-accidental. It is for the local authority to prove its case. It is not for the mother to disprove it. In particular it is not for the mother to disprove it by proving how the injuries were in fact sustained. Neither is it for the court to determine how the injuries were sustained. The court's task is to determine whether the local authority has proved its case on the balance of probability. Where, as here, there is a degree of medical uncertainty and credible evidence of a possible alternative explanation to that contended for by the local authority, the question for the court is not 'has that possible alternative explanation been proved' but rather it should ask itself, 'in the light of that possible alternative explanation can the court be satisfied that the local authority has proved its case on the simple balance of probability'.""
Lies and Credibility
As the President, McFarlane LJ observed in Re H-C (Children) [2016] EWCA Civ 136 at paragraph 97:
A family court, in common with a criminal court, can rely upon a finding that a witness has lied as evidence in support of a primary positive allegation. The well-known authority is the case of R v Lucas (R) [1981] QB 720 in which the Court of Appeal Criminal Division, after stressing that people sometimes tell lies for reasons other than a belief that the lie is necessary to conceal guilt, held that four conditions must be satisfied before a defendant’s lie could be seen as supporting the prosecution case as explained in the judgment of the court given by Lord Lane CJ:
“To be capable of amounting to corroboration the lie told out of court must first of all be deliberate. Secondly it must relate to a material issue. Thirdly the motive for the lie must be a realisation of guilt and a fear of the truth. The jury should in appropriate cases be reminded that people sometimes lie, for example, in an attempt to bolster up a just cause, or out of shame or out of a wish to conceal disgraceful behaviour from their family. Fourthly the statement must be clearly shown to be a lie by evidence other than that of the accomplice who is to be corroborated, that is to say by admission or by evidence from an independent witness.”
The decision in R v Lucas has been the subject of a number of further decisions of the Court of Appeal Criminal Division over the years, however the core conditions set out by Lord Lane remain authoritative. The approach in R v Lucas is not confined, as it was on the facts of Lucas itself, to a statement made out of court and can apply to a “lie” made in the course of the court proceedings and the approach is not limited solely to evidence concerning accomplices.
In the Family Court in an appropriate case a judge will not infrequently directly refer to the authority of R v Lucas in giving a judicial self-direction as to the approach to be taken to an apparent lie. Where the “lie” has a prominent or central relevance to the case such a self-direction is plainly sensible and good practice.
One highly important aspect of the Lucas decision, and indeed the approach to lies generally in the criminal jurisdiction, needs to be borne fully in mind by family judges. It is this: in the criminal jurisdiction the “lie” is never taken, of itself, as direct proof of guilt. As is plain from the passage quoted from Lord Lane’s judgment in Lucas, where the relevant conditions are satisfied the lie is “capable of amounting to a corroboration”. In recent times the point has been most clearly made in the Court of Appeal Criminal Division in the case of R v Middleton [2001] Crim.L.R. 251. In my view there should be no distinction between the approach taken by the criminal court on the issue of lies to that adopted in the family court. Judges should therefore take care to ensure that they do not rely upon a conclusion that an individual has lied on a material issue as direct proof of guilt.
In Lancashire County Council v The Children and Others [2014] EWHC 3 (Fam) at paragraph 9 of his judgment and having directed himself on the relevant law, Jackson J (as he then was) said:-
‘…where repeated accounts are given the court must think carefully about the significance or otherwise of any reported discrepancies. They may arise for a number of reasons. One possibility is of course that they are lies designed to hide culpability. Another is that they are lies told for other reasons. Further possibilities include faulty recollection or confusion at the time of stress or where the importance of accuracy is not fully appreciated, or there may be inaccuracy or mistake in the record-keeping or recollection of the person hearing and relaying the account. The possible effect of delay and repeated questioning upon memory should also be considered, as should the effect of one person on hearing accounts given by another. As memory fades, a desire to iron out wrinkles may not be unnatural; a process that might inelegantly be described as “story-creep” may occur without any necessary inferences of bad faith.’
The importance of following these principles was reinforced in the decision made by the Court of Appeal in Re A, B and C (Children) [2021] EWCA Civ 451 and the judgment of Macur LJ. In paragraph 52 the learned judge states:
“It is quite possible that the tribunal may conclude that, in the particular circumstances of the case, the integrity and substance of the uncorroborated evidence of the child complainant is sufficiently compelling to lead them to determine that the alleged perpetrator’s denials must be a lie. In others the tribunal may reasonably determine that it is incumbent to look for other evidence in support”.
And at paragraph 54:
“That a witness’s dishonesty may be irrelevant in determining an issue of fact is commonly acknowledged in judgments, and with respect to the Recorder as we see in her judgment at [40], in formulaic terms…But this formulation leaves open the question: how and when is a witness’s lack of credibility to be factored into the equation of determining an issue of fact? In my view, the answer is provided by the terms of the entire ‘Lucas’ direction as given, when necessary, in criminal trials.
Chapter 16-3, paragraphs 1 and 2 of the December 2020 Crown Court Compendium, provides a useful legal summary:
A defendant’s lie, whether made before the trial or in the course of evidence or both, may be probative of guilt. A lie is only capable of supporting other evidence against D if the jury are sure that (1) it is shown by other evidence in the case, to be a deliberate untruth; i.e. it did not arise from confusion or mistake; (2) it relates to a significant issue, (3) it was not told for a reason advanced by or on behalf of D, or for some other reason arising from the evidence, which does not point to D’s guilt.
The direction should be tailored to the circumstances of the case, but the jury must be directed that only if they are sure these criteria are satisfied can D’s lie be used as some support fotr the prosecution case, but that the lie itself cannot prove guilt…”
The application of the above guidance was further clarified by Peter Jackson LJ in the case of Re H (Children: Uncertain Perpetrator: Lies)[2024] EWCA Civ 1261.
Para 21: “The court’s view of a witness’s overall credibility and reliability will naturally contribute to its evaluation of whether it can accept their evidence on the critical issues. If it concludes that lies have been told, it will consider what weight, if any, should be given to that aspect of the matter, after due consideration of any explanations have been offered. That is part of the normal process of sifting and weighing the evidence, and explaining the result. The family courts encounter many forms of bad behaviour and they are used to assessing their true significance for the issue in hand. There is no special rule of evidence for lies.”
Para 22; “I would therefore make one observation about the description of good practice in Re A, B and C. At [58(iii)] it is said that the court should seek to identify the basis on which it can be determined that the only explanation for the lie(s) is guilt. That draws on the slightly different jury direction in the Crown Court Compendium… which requires that a lie is only capable of supporting other evidence against a defendant if the jury are sure that it was not told for a reason advanced by or on behalf of the defendant, or for some other reason arising from the evidence, which does not point to the defendant’s guilt.” Para 22
Para 23: “Relying on a literal reading of Re A, B and C, Mr Barnes further argues that the court is required to exclude a lie from consideration altogether in any case where it cannot be satisfied (to whatever standard) that the only explanation for it is to conceal guilt. I do not accept that submission. There will be some cases where the ultimate finding is so critically dependent on the assessment of the particular lie – that the court may out of caution wish to direct itself in accordance with Re A, B and C. ….. It will be sufficient for the judge to recall that the true significance of a lie must be carefully assessed, for all the well-known reasons noted by the judge in the present case. A general exclusionary rule, exclusively directed at lies, would be inconsistent with the duty on the court to consider all the evidence. Once it has done that, its conclusion in an individual case may be that the lie was told to conceal guilt, but that is a conclusion, not a test…Any other approach would hamper the court in carrying out its important assessment of credibility and its evaluation of particular issues of fact.
The dicta of Peter Jackson J (as he then was) in Re BR (Proof of Facts) [2015] EWFC 41. In particular paragraphs 4-7:
The court acts on evidence, not speculation or assumption.  It acts on facts, not worries or concerns.
Evidence comes in many forms.  It can be live, written, direct, hearsay, electronic, photographic, circumstantial, factual, or by way of expert opinion.  It can concern major topics and small details, things that are important and things that are trivial.
The burden of proving a fact rests on the person who asserts it.
The standard of proof is the balance of probabilities: Is it more likely than not that the event occurred?  Neither the seriousness of the allegation, nor the seriousness of the consequences, nor the inherent probabilities alters this.
Where an allegation is a serious one, there is no requirement that the evidence must be of a special quality.  The court will consider grave allegations with proper care, but evidence is evidence and the approach to analysing it remains the same in every case.  In my view, statements of principle (some relied on in this case) that suggest that an enhanced level of evidential cogency or clarity is required in order to prove a very serious allegation do not assist and may lead a fact-finder into error.  Despite all disclaimers, reference to qualitative concepts such as cogency and clarity may wrongly be taken to imply that some elevated standard of proof is called for.
Nor does the seriousness of the consequences of a finding of fact affect the standard to which it must be proved.  Whether a man was in a London street at a particular time might be of no great consequence if the issue is whether he was rightly issued with a parking ticket, but it might be of huge consequence if he has been charged with a murder that occurred that day in Paris.  The evidential standard to which his presence in the street must be proved is nonetheless the same.
The court takes account of any inherent probability or improbability of an event having occurred as part of a natural process of reasoning.  But the fact that an event is a very common one does not lower the standard of probability to which it must be proved.  Nor does the fact that an event is very uncommon raise the standard of proof that must be satisfied before it can be said to have occurred.
Similarly, the frequency or infrequency with which an event generally occurs cannot divert attention from the question of whether it actually occurred …
The court must guard against the danger of reversing the burden of proof. The burden remains at all times upon the local authority to prove the facts alleged to the requisite standard, and it is not for a respondent to disprove facts or present an alternative explanation for events. The risk however of inadvertently reversing the burden of proof by according improper weight to a respondent’s inability to provide an explanation for these most serious allegations, which include detail which may seem to have experiential characteristics is particularly acute.  Re M (Fact-finding: Burden of Proof) [2013] 2 FLR 874 at 881:
‘The burden of proof lies on the local authority to prove the case against the parents. The standard of proof is the balance of probabilities, and that means the same in this kind of case as in every other, a simple balance of probability. Suspicion is not proof, and the burden must always remain on the local authority and should not be reversed…’
and
‘That, too, was the effect of the judge's view of the case: that absent a parental explanation, there was no satisfactory benign explanation, ergo there must be a malevolent explanation.  And it is that leap which troubles me.  It does not seem to me that the conclusion necessarily follows unless, wrongly, the burden of proof has been reversed, and the parents were required to satisfy the court that this is not a non-accidental injury.’
I have reminded myself of the specific guidance on the law and authoritative guidance pertaining to ABE Interviews given by MacDonald J in the case of AS v TH (False Allegations of Abuse)[2016] EWHC 532 Fam. In addition, a second judgment of Mr Justice MacDonald in the case of Re P (Sexual Abuse – Finding of Fact Hearing) [2019] EWFC 27. I have carefully considered the valuable points made about children’s suggestibility and ‘confirmation bias’, and the need for professionals to keep an open mind, together with the 12 point memorandum in paragraph 577:
“That said, and considering the authorities set out above, the Report of the Inquiry into child abuse in Cleveland 1987 Cm 412 and Report of the Inquiry into the Removal of Children from Orkney in February 1991 among others and the contents of the current ABE Guidance, I am satisfied that this court can take judicial notice of the following matters:
Children, and especially young children, are suggestible.
Memory is prone to error and easily influenced by the environment in which recall is  invited.
Memories can be confabulated from imagined experiences, it is possible to induce false  memories and children can speak sincerely and emotionally about events that did not  in fact occur.
Allegations made by children may emerge in a piecemeal fashion, with children often  not reporting events in a linear history, reporting them in a partial way and revisiting  topics.
The wider circumstances of the child’s life may influence, explain or colour what the  child is saying.
Factors affecting when a child says something will include their capacity to understand  their world and their role within it, requiring caution when interpreting children’s  references to behaviour or parts of the body through the prism of adult learning or  reading.
Accounts given by children are susceptible to influence by leading or otherwise  suggestive questions, repetition, pressure, threats, negative stereotyping and  encouragement, reward or praise.
Accounts given by children are susceptible to influence as the result of bias or  preconceived ideas on the part of the interlocutor.
Accounts given by children are susceptible to contamination by the statements of  others, which contamination may influence a child’s responses.
Children may embellish or overlay a general theme with apparently convincing detail  which can appear highly credible and be very difficult to detect, even for those who  are experienced in dealing with children.
Delay between an event recounted and the allegation made with respect to that event  may influence the accuracy of the account given.
Within this context, the way, and the stage at which a child is asked questions/interviewed   will have a profound effect on the accuracy of the child’s testimony
I have read and reminded myself of the revised guidance for ABE Interviews published subsequent to the above case and contained in the January 2022 edition.
These are the factors and legal guidance which I have borne in mind, and when I say I have considered the law it is against this background but also that of the Human Rights Act 1998. This is plainly right because the consequences for this family are serious with the potential to affect the long term care planning for C1.
I have read the electronic file of evidence provided during the course of this hearing which includes the statements and documents filed by the local authority; the parents; the children’s guardian, and information from the South Yorkshire Police (SYP).
I have watched the ABE interview in which C2 makes her allegations and read the transcript of that interview. I have listened to the audio interview which the father gave to the Police on the 2023-March-29 and read the transcript of it. I have received and read the written submissions from each party for which I am grateful.
The court has heard oral evidence from the following 9 witnesses.
C2 in person via video link during her school half-term on the 01.11.2024;
MC2 (C2’s mother);
AC2, (C2’s aunt);
LS (a friend of AC2 and relation of MC3);
Sarah Onyon (the allocated social worker);
DC Blake Hull (former Investigative Officer with SYP, now with the Met. Police);
MC1 (the mother supported by an intermediary);
FC1 (the father);
PGFC1 (the paternal grandfather of C1).
It should be recorded that even where I do not refer to any particular piece of oral or written evidence during the course of this judgment it has nevertheless been taken into consideration. Whilst many issues were raised during the course of the hearing I have determined only those which, in my opinion, require resolving to determine the disputed issues at this hearing justly.
It should also be noted that where reported speech is given in italics in this judgment it may be taken directly from the written evidence or from my contemporary notes of the oral evidence, and where it is from the latter it is materially and factually accurate but it is possible that some quotations may not be verbatim due to the speed at which the note was written during the oral evidence.
The hearing has been conducted as a hybrid hearing with some witnesses participating remotely via the CVP to accommodate their availability or willingness to attend, and other parties and their witnesses attending court in person. No party has raised any concerns regarding the format of the hearing during the hearing itself.
THE BACKGROUND AND ALLEGATIONS
The following is set out to understand the context of this judgment and is agreed or unopposed unless stated otherwise.
It is agreed there have been four separate people who have made complaints of sexual assault against this father:
On the 16.07.17 an ex-partner of FC1, then aged 19 years old,  alleged FC1 had digitally penetrated her.  The call was made by the complainant’s friend.  The matter was not taken further by the Police.
On the 05.02.22 C3 (a child then aged over 13 years and the daughter of MC3) alleged FC1 had sexually assaulted her on 05.02.22 by [details redacted].  She alleged FC1 did similar on the following day, 06.02.22.
C3 also alleged FC1 had sexually abused her about 2 years previously when she was 12/13 years old. She alleged [details redacted].
Child 4, a friend of C3’s, also alleged FC1 sexually touched her at a sleepover at C3’s home on 05.02.22.
C2 makes her allegations of FC1 perpetrating sexual abuse upon her between August 2022 and February 2023 by touching her ‘private parts’ above and underneath her clothes.
Apart from the allegations made by C2, none of the allegations made by the other three complainants were pursued by the police, and for evidential reasons the local authority does not seek to include those allegations as part of these proceedings.  They are referred to in this judgment because they form part of the father’s case in defending himself against the allegations made by C2. He asserts the nature of these allegations were known to C2, her family and in the local community, and this may be the reason why C2 has adopted them and made false allegations against him.
Prior to March 2023, MC1 and MC2 were good friends. They trusted each other to care for each other’s child. Before CZ was removed from the mother’s care in August 2022 and placed in the care of his father, CZ would stay with MC2, and C2 would stay over with MC1. The parents assert they met and began the friendship which led to their relationship via Facebook around January/February 2022. The local authority asserts there is evidence FC1 has, on occasions, suggested it was earlier than this, in 2021. It is agreed, MC2 and C2 met and came into contact with FC1 through MC1, and on occasions they would all socialise together. It is MC2’s evidence that prior to the precipitating incident in March 2023, she had no concerns or worries about FC1, or C2 being in contact with FC1.
The precipitating incident occurred over the evening/early hours of the morning of Friday 24th/Saturday 2023-March-25. It began when LS became aware of MC1 trying to make contact via Facebook with someone LS knew. Through this platform, LS saw a photograph of FC1 on Facebook with some children in the background of it. As LS is related to MC3, she was already aware of the nature of the previous allegations which had been made against FC1 by C3.
This photograph and the association of FC1 with MC1 caused LS concern, and it caused her concern for her friend AC2 who she knew was a friend of MC1, and for AC2’s children. LS did not know MC2 or C2 other than recognizing them in passing.
Around 11pm on the evening of Friday 2023-March-24, LS made contact with AC2 and told her that: “FC1 touched my niece, Police and everything were involved’. I wouldn’t trust him with my kids. I believe he did it, as you don’t lie about something like that”. AC2 informed LS that her niece, C2 visits MC1’s home and often stays at her home.
At the time this conversation was taking place between LS and AC2, AC2 was in a relationship with MC2’s brother and she was living with MC2 and C2. The conversation was made via mobile telephone and the phone was on loudspeaker to enable MC2 to hear what was being said. In her written evidence, MC2 states this was the first time she had been made aware of any allegations being made against FC1 of this nature. I accept her evidence on this point because there is no evidence to suggest otherwise.
After the phone call ended, MC2 went upstairs to speak to C2 and asked her daughter:  “Has FC1 ever touched you?” and C2 confirmed that he had in a way which constitutes a sexual assault.
MC2 agrees she was angry and upset by this information and decided she would go and confront FC1 there and then. MC2 and her then partner, SB went round to where FC1 was known to be living with his own parents. By this point in the chronology it was towards midnight of the 24th March and getting into the early hours of Saturday morning, 2023-March-25.
MC2 agrees she presented at the home of the paternal grandparents, Mr and Mrs [FC1] Senior as angry and upset and was shouting about FC1 being a paedophile, in evidence, she said she believed the word she actually used to describe him was a ‘nonce’.
MC2 agrees she said to FC1 something along the lines of “If you haven’t done it to C2, come and confront me” (her oral evidence) and “I didn’t think you’d have done it” (her statement to the Police). In her oral evidence, MC2 explained she said this because she wanted to think he hadn’t done what C2 had told her.
It is accepted by MC2 that Mr and Mrs [FC1] Senior told her they had called the police and eventually MC2 and her partner went home. MC2 reported what C2 had said about FC1 to the police later on Saturday 2023-March-25. The police report records her call being made at 11.30am on that date.
On Tuesday 2023-March-28, DC Helen Barratt and DC Blake Hull visited C2 at home where they spoke to both C2 and MC2. DC Hull took the lead in asking questions and DC Barratt took notes. They spoke to C2 alone and she told them, in summary, that she had been touched by FC1 on her ‘front bits’ with his hand under her clothes. C2 identified an occasion when she was in ‘his girlfriend’s house’ when she had told his girlfriend she was going to lie down for a bit and FC1 followed her upstairs and was watching TV when he touched her; another occasion she identified MC1 being in the room as well; and on one occasion when ‘[MC1] went to a meeting’ and “after the meeting she (MC1) met us at McDonalds” . C2 informs the Police officers it started from August and when asked how did she know it’s been happening since August, the Officer’s note states “since she had a boy took off her”. Which is a reference to CZ being removed from the mother’s care in August 2022. C2 is asked whether she has told anyone about this, and the officer’s note confirms she has told “My mum” on “Friday” .
Following this exchange at C2’s family home, the Police arranged an Achieving Best Evidence (ABE) interview with C2 later the same day. DS Alex Edwards has provided a witness statement which confirms the South Yorkshire Police are aware it is best practice when interviewing young children to use an intermediary so the child understands the procedure and their best evidence is obtained. Nevertheless, the decision was made to interview C2 without an intermediary present.  The reasons for this are stated to be because the wait for an intermediary at the date the decision was made was approximately 3-6 months, and both C2 and MC2 wanted to provide the evidence to enable C2 to move on from the trauma caused by the assault.
The Police investigation continued until November 2023 when a decision was made, for evidential reasons, not to charge FC1 with any criminal offence and the investigation was closed. At the time of C1’s birth this local authority was involved due to the allegations made by C2 and due to its concerns about the mother’s previous parenting of her older children.
For this reason, this application was issued on the 2023-December-13, and an interim care order was made without any opposition from the parents on  the 2023-December-15 with an interim care plan for C1 to be cared for by his maternal aunt and uncle, where he remains.
C2’S ALLEGATIONS AND HER ‘ABE’ INTERVIEW
In her ABE interview on the 2023-March-28, C2 repeats the allegations she made to DC Hull and DC Barratt earlier the same day. She alleges FC1 has “touched me down below” she alleges he has done it “loads of times” and it started in August. She identifies the date by reference to “when [MC1] had her son took off her”. In the transcript C2 states “I think that FC1’s done it while [MC1] were in another bedroom, in the bathroom as well, when she were in the bath, so when MC1 were in the bath he’s done it then”. Having watched and listened to the video, it is my judgment that C2 does refer to ‘MC1 being in the bedroom’ but then immediately corrects herself and identifies MC1 being in the bathroom because she has used the wrong word and she is not suggesting MC1 was in the bedroom at the time any alleged abuse takes place.
C2 states it has also happened when MC1 was in the living room, and on another occasion when MC1 went to a ‘meeting’. C2 identifies the day MC1 was at the meeting as being the final occasion it happened. C2 is clear “MC1 don’t know about this, what FC1’s done”. C2 tells the police officers that FC1 “told me to not tell my mum and dad” and describes him “squeezing” the front bits of her private parts which made her feel angry because she didn’t like it. When asked which parts of his hand could she feel, C2 replies “His fingers and that bit there” - pointing to the bottom of the palm of her hand. When asked whether FC1 put anything inside her private parts, C2 states “No” and shakes her head.
FC1 made an application for C2 to be cross-examined in accordance with Re W (Children)(Abuse: Oral Evidence)[2010] UKSC 12 [2010] 1 FLR 1485. The application was supported by the other parties and by C2 herself. C2 attended court on the 2024-November-1 to give her oral evidence via video link from a different room. She was 11 years old and physically, she appears very similar to how she presents in her ABE interview, still very much a child not an adolescent. The date was chosen to coincide with her school half-term to cause the minimum of disruption to her education. On this occasion an intermediary was present, C2 participated in a familiarization visit the same week but on a different day and also watched her ABE interview.  A schedule of questions was agreed by the advocates in advance and approved by the court, it was agreed those questions would be asked of C2 by Mr Taylor.
Part way through C2’s oral evidence it became apparent she was having difficulty hearing the questions being asked of her due to problems with the court’s technology. It led to C2 giving her oral evidence in the presence of myself, the intermediary, and Mr Taylor sitting in a separate room away from the main court room, advocates and their respective clients, and her evidence being relayed by the CVP video link to them with mixed results. Fortunately, both myself and Mr Taylor were able to hear firsthand what was said by C2 in response to the questions and took notes. The transcript of C2’s oral evidence which appears in the case lines bundle at A125 is a composite transcript compiled from each of these resources.
In response to being asked the agreed questions, C2 firmly maintained the account she had given in her ABE interview. She remembered MC1 going for a job interview (“the meeting”) and stated that FC1 looked after her on his own when MC1 went for the interview. C2 pointed to the pictorial aid for  breakfast time when answering what time of day was it when MC1 went for the interview. C2 stated she was still asleep when MC1 left and denied FC1’s assertion she was dressed and in the bedroom when MC1 left. C2 agreed she might have talked to MC1 on a video call after MC1 left for the interview because they were meant to meet up with her after the interview. C2 recalled meeting the mother at the bus stop but couldn’t recall whether they went on to McDonald’s or not, nor could she recall speaking to her own mother that morning.
C2 was asked whether she was sure FC1 had touched her down below or whether she was guessing about it. C2 replied, “I wasn’t guessing, he did it”. She was informed, FC1 said it didn’t happen, he didn’t touch you down below and was asked, Is he telling the truth about that? C2 replied, “No, he isn’t telling the truth”. C2 was asked, If FC1 touched you down below, why did you continue to visit MC1’s flat? C2 replied, “because I didn’t know he was going to do it over and over again”.
Between December 2022 and August 2023, KMH was employed by C2’s school as a Safeguarding Officer. At approximately 8.35 hours on Monday 2023-March-27, KMH received a telephone call from MC2 in which MC2 told her that C2 had disclosed she had been sexually abused by a family friend and she had reported this to the Police. MC2 was asking for support for C2. KMH’s further, unchallenged evidence is that on Thursday 2023-June-8, C2 approached her looking upset, C2 “mentioned she felt sick all the time and when she ate, it hurt her stomach. C2 stated she also shakes sometimes and she doesn’t know why. During our conversation I could smell a strong cigarette smoke on C2. She was constantly picking at her finger nails, which were extremely short and looked very sore. C2 did not make eye contact during the conversation”.
There is an agreed written statement from NR who was a Teaching Assistant for C2. NR’s unchallenged description of C2 is: “C2 is absolutely adorable. She’s kind, honest, and loving, but I wouldn’t describe her as outgoing. She’s shy at first, but then she does become quite chatty. I was told that she was facing some issues at home, but I wasn’t initially given any details because I didn’t need to know. When I was told that something had happened, I did notice a change. She’d become quiet. She used to love being at school, but she started to make excuses to go home early. It was usually bellyache, feeling tired, or not feeling very well. I sometimes put her in a separate room with a pillow so she could have a rest”.  MC2 agreed with this description of her daughter. FC1 did not dispute it and when asked in cross examination: You’ve not known C2 to be a liar? FC1 confirmed: “No, not really, she’s never lied to me”. The mother also confirmed she had never known C2 to tell lies about the ‘big things’.
On Monday 2023-June-12 C2 approached NR “saying she felt sad and wanted to speak to me after lunch. I went to speak to her immediately after the lunch break. C2 said she wanted to speak to me about what had happened.” NR suggests someone from the inclusion team speaks to C2 about it instead but C2 prefers to speak to NR. C2 agrees NR could speak to the Safeguarding Liaison Officer, KMH first to find out about what had happened. NR obtains this information and permission  to speak to C2 on her own about it from KMH.
In the conversation which follows between C2 and NR, C2 tells her she is feeling “sad and sick…sometimes she didn’t want to be in school because she wanted to cry”. NR asks C2 if she wanted to talk about what happened and C2 said she does. It is agreed C2 told NR the following: “C2 went on to tell me that while on a sleepover at her mum’s best friend’s house, Mum’s best friend’s boyfriend came in when she was supposed to be asleep and touched her down below. I asked how long he was in her room and C2 said ‘Not long’. I asked what did she do and C2 said she didn’t like it. I asked her if there was anything else, did he want her to touch him, and C2 said no. C2 then told me that she had been to the doctor who was trying to help her with feeling sad and not eating”…. “Following the above conversation with C2 she came to talk to me once or twice a week if she was having a bad day or feeling sad.  I do not know the specific dates for these incidences of support and at no time in them did she talk about what she had already told me or make any further disclosures.”
I pause to note that what C2 told NR is entirely consistent with what she had said previously.  Simple repetition does not of itself create any corroboration for her account but the consistency of it does add credence to its reliability.
MC2’s Evidence
MC2 initially attended court in person and confirmed the general accuracy of the statement she gave to the police on the 2023-June-20 but also expressed her view some parts were recorded inaccurately by the Police, such as where it referred to her calling FC1 a paedophile as her recollection is that she used the word ‘nonce’, not paedophile. In my judgment, that difference is immaterial in this case. During a break in her evidence MC2 became upset and left court and refused to return to complete her evidence. Despite attempts by the court via the local authority to encourage her to return voluntarily she could not be persuaded, and it led to the court issuing a witness summons before MC2 returned and completed her evidence with the use of special measures, specifically via a CVP video link.
The agreed parts of MC2’s evidence are how she became aware of previous allegations of sexual abuse having been made against FC1. There has been no dispute the information originated from LS, was communicated by her to AC2, and ultimately shared with MC2.  It was clear from MC2’s evidence that she believes her daughter when C2 told her ‘FC1 had touched her down below’ and given that firmly held belief she is understandably very upset and angry about it which came across in her evidence. I have weighed this in the balance when considering her evidence as a whole and considered whether this would cause her to lie or exaggerate about any of the facts in this case.
MC2’s agreed evidence is that the last time C2 stayed over with MC1 and FC1 was in February 2023. Therefore, any allegation of sexual abuse described by C2 has to have occurred in or before February 2023. MC2 recalls phoning C2 during the morning of the last time she stayed over and “I asked her where auntie MC1 was, and she said that she’d gone to an interview at a warehouse. She said that FC1 was looking after her”. This occasion is significant because it is one of occasions which C2 later identifies as being left alone with FC1 when he sexually abused her and, if accurate, would provide FC1 with the opportunity to assault C2.
It is agreed MC2 cared for CZ and C2 together and MC1 reciprocated the arrangement. It is agreed they both had a very limited support network. MC2’s evidence is that MC1 was the “only friend I had and she knew that”. C2 stayed over at MC1’s “quite a lot, quite regularly, each week I would have CZ” . She knew FC1 through his relationship with MC1 and, prior to the events of the 24th /25th  March 2023 she held no concerns or worries about him. MC2 told the court that FC1 stayed over a lot at MC1’s home, she said, “Yes, he stayed at MC1’s a lot apart from being with his daughter on a Friday”, and it is agreed neither FC1 or MC1 told her about any allegations of sexual abuse having been made previously against FC1 or that the time he spent with his daughter, CX was supervised at social care’s request. Nor was MC2 told by them about the reason why CZ was removed from the care of MC1.
There is a contradiction in MC2’s police statement about the index incident date where she refers to it being the evening of the 25th March and not the evening of the 24th March but I attach no weight to such minor discrepancies.  The events of the night in question when C2 made her allegations against FC1 started shortly before midnight on Friday 24th March and concluded in the early hours of Saturday 25th March.  Where incidents cross over into two dates it is easy to understand how witnesses may be mistaken in their recollection about the precise date. It is a mistake which is repeated by the paternal grandfather, PGFC1 in his witness statement and by FC1 in his police interview when he refers to ‘Saturday night’ but it is common ground all of the witnesses were recalling the same night and incident.
In her oral evidence MC2 stated there were approximately 9 or 10 people at the family event at her house that night and after hearing the contents of the telephone call from LS she made them all aware about what had been said about FC1, but to her knowledge she was the only person who spoke to C2 about it and knows of no other person speaking to C2 about the allegations after she left the house, although other members of the household did take care of C2 whilst MC2 was out.
MC2 agreed she took C2 into the bathroom ‘straight away’ and spoke to her on her own, and states that although she had enjoyed a drink at the family gathering she was not drunk and was in control of herself. It is agreed MC2 asked C2 a direct question: “Has FC1 ever touched you?”   and in her written evidence she states that C2 burst into tears and said: “Yeah, Mummy. She placed a hand over her face and cried. I’ve never heard her cry like that before. I asked her, ‘Where’s he touched you?’. She moved her hand over her vagina and said ‘down there’. I asked, ‘Has he done it with your trousers on or without? She said both. I asked her, ‘Where was MC1?’. She said, ‘In the kitchen, I was trying to go to sleep.”
In her oral evidence MC2 readily agreed that after speaking with C2 she went to the home of the paternal grandparents where she knew the father was living to confront him about what C2 had told her. She thought she left home to go there ‘around 20 minutes after’ she had spoken to C2 and she went with her then partner, SB. MC2 agreed they were both shouting including shouting words like ‘nonce’’, she agreed she shouted, “If you haven’t done it to C2, come and confront me”. MC2 confirmed she said something along the lines of “I didn’t think you would have done it” because she wanted to think FC1 hadn’t done it. She agreed she had been drinking alcohol and “was tipsy but I weren’t drunk”. This is consistent with what C2 said about her mother having consumed alcohol but not being drunk. There is a possible inconsistency between MC2 and C2 regarding whether C2 knew her mother had left the house to go to FC1’s home.  MC2 stated C2 knew because “She seen me go, she was awake at the time” whereas when C2 was asked the question: “You spoke to your mum in the bathroom about FC1 touching you. After that, did your mum go out of the house?” and C2’s reply in her oral evidence is: “I’m not too sure, cos I went to bed”.
MC2 agreed she contacted the Police and the telephone called is logged at 11.30am on Saturday 2023-March-25. The information recorded by the South Yorkshire Police on that date is set out below in paragraph (75).
In response to this report, it is agreed DC Blake Hull and his colleague DC Helen Barratt attended MC2’s home on Tuesday 2023-March-28.  The Police officers spoke to MC2 and to C2 separately.
The pocket notebook entry made by DC Hull records MC2 to have said she noticed C2 had been quiet and biting her nails and she had asked what was wrong and C2 then told her ‘FC1  had touched her’. When questioned about this in cross examination, MC2 denied saying this in those terms. She explained, “When I found out about FC1 touching her, I convinced myself this is why she is biting her nails. This was after I found out about her. I told the Police after it had happened she was biting her nails and sleeping all the time, that’s not right for an 11 year old child”. MC2 agreed C2 had been biting her nails before ‘FC1 was on the scene’  but “not as bad as it is now, she’s coming home from school and going straight to bed, that’s not right for an 11 year old child, she should go out and play with her friends.” “It got worse, she was biting her nails before but it got worse and she doesn’t have any nails at all now, she is anxious and has bitten them all off, she doesn’t want to go to school in the morning and I have to push her to go to school”. MC2 attributed this to the fact C2 needs to travel past FC1’s house to reach her school.
MC2 confirmed there had been an occasion when C2 was staying over at MC1’s home and C2 called her whilst MC1 was at a job interview. MC2 said: “Yes, it was at a warehouse and FC1 was left with my daughter in MC1’s house. We were not aware at that point, not aware until LS told AC2… if I am right the phonecall was in the morning…she told me that MC1’s gone for an interview and she were alone with FC1”.
It does not appear in either of MC2’s statements that FC1 had smacked or slapped her across the bottom on an earlier occasion prior to the night C2 made her allegations but she volunteered this information in response to being asked: “Did anyone in the house disbelieve what was being said about FC1? And she responded “No, not when he slapped my arse in front of MC1 in my own house” … “He said to my mum, he should be with me and he should be C2’s dad and slapped my bum in front of his girlfriend who is sat there now”. Thereby confirming it had happened which, unknown to her, is consistent with the account C2 gave in her oral evidence. Both parents agree FC1 slapped or smacked MC2 across her bottom but they assert FC1 did this as a joke and there had been no conflict about it between the three adults, only ‘banter’.
MC2 confirmed, in the intervening period since March 2023, C2 has never resiled from her account or suggested to her that what she told her about FC1 is untrue.
AC2 and LS’s Evidence
AC2 confirmed her written statements and gave evidence consistent with them. AC2 confirmed she previously had a close friendship with MC1 but had never met FC1.
AC2 recalls receiving a text out of the blue from LS during a family gathering at the home of MC2. MC2 confirmed the date and time of this family gathering was the evening of Friday 2023-March-24 to celebrate her mother’s birthday. I accept this date to be correct, the totality of the evidence from all sources including FC1 and his father, PGFC1 would support this time and date.
The text AC2 received asked her whether she knew MC1. AC2 confirmed MC1 was a friend of her’s which elicited the reply from LS: “[AC2], I will tell you her partner is a peadophile, don’t tell me know niece stays at her house (sic)?” AC2 states she felt sick and went ‘to grab MC2’ telling her “I need to speak to you its urgent”. By this point LS had phoned AC2 so she put her phone on loudspeaker to enable MC2 to hear what was being said. AC2’s recollection is that this took place in the living room of MC2’s house with the door shut. She thought C2 was in the kitchen at the time. Her evidence on this issue is: “I can’t recall her being there, I think her mum spoke to her after I put the phone down on LS”. If C2 had been in the kitchen, AC2 did not consider any person would have heard what was being said in the living room because the door was shut. In contrast, in her oral evidence, C2 states “I was stood there and it was on loudspeaker and I could hear it. I was stood next to them”. AC2 could recall MC2 speaking to C2 in the bathroom after the phone call but she didn’t know what was said between them because she wasn’t present.  This is consistent with the evidence of C2 and MC2.
AC2 agreed she was unaware of any sexual abuse allegations being made against FC1 by anyone until she received this text from LS. Mr Taylor did not challenge this on behalf of his client. This is consistent with the evidence of MC2, and it persuades me that any opportunity for C2’s family to discuss these allegations in the presence of C2 is limited to after receipt of the text message and phone call late in the evening of the 2023-March-24.
LS confirmed the veracity of her written statements save and except her recollection is that it was a friend called ‘S’ not ‘K’ who the mother sent a friend request to on Facebook which led to LS’s involvement and concerned attention. LS confirmed, the reason she sent the text to AC2 was because “I saw AC2 was a mutual friend of FC1’s new partner and I was asking her how well she knew this girl and whether her children went round. I didn’t imagine any other children were involved. I had no idea C2 was going round to MC1’s house, none at all”.
LS confirmed she made the telephone call to AC2 but was not aware MC2 could hear the call and she didn’t speak to or text MC2 directly that evening. LS confirmed there were other things she knew about FC1 which she did not communicate to AC2 that night. LS agreed she had texted MC2 via AC2’s phone a couple of days later and had seen MC2 and C2 in passing at a social club but had “not really spoken to MC2 since then, not in detail and had not spoken at all about the other things” she knew or could say because it was personal relating to her own child.
The Police and DC Blake Hull’s Evidence
It is agreed MC2 made a telephone call to the South Yorkshire Police which was logged at 11.30am on Saturday 2023-March-25. In it, the report states, “Caller reporting that her daughter has been sexually assaulted by a family friend, the name that she has given is FC1”. The call handler records, “Her daughter C2 has told her that when staying at the above location FC1 has touched her over her clothing and under her underwear. Her mum has noticed that she has been quiet and biting her nails so asked her what was wrong and that is when she disclosed that FC1 has touched her. She hasn’t been able to get a definite date just that it happened when she has been stopping with her mum’s friend MC1 who is currently with FC1”.
This complaint led to DC Hull and DC Barratt attending the home of MC2 on Tuesday 2023-March-28. The officers spoke to MC2 and C2 separately and in different rooms, neither knew what the other said to the Police. When DC Hull spoke to C2 he confirms he asked her questions regarding the basics of the allegations – what happened, where it happened and how it happened. DC Barrett contemporaneously recorded the conversation and her typed notes of it are in the court bundle.
In her initial complaint to the Police, the following is included in the information recorded by  DC Barratt about what C2 told them, “He touched me on my front bits…it’s been since August, since she had a boy took off her, she was wearing clothes, it was under her clothes, MC1 didn’t know about it, MC1 was in the living room and she was in the bedroom, FC1 had told her not to tell her mum and dad when it first started.” When asked if she had told anyone about this, C2 confirms she told “my mum, on Friday.”   When asked why she told her mum, C2 is reported to have said, “My auntie down club, her daughter was touched by him, my mum took me upstairs and asked me if he touched me and I said yes”. C2 is reportedly asked, Did you know he had touched other girls? And her reply is recorded as: “No. my mum says he’s done it to quite a few girls”.
The information gathered by DC Hull and DC Barratt is sufficient to persuade them an ABE interview of C2 is justified and the same is organized for later that day.
I pause to note at this point, there is a discrepancy between what the Police have recorded as being the catalyst for the complaint and the contents of MC2’s section 9 Criminal Justice Act statement dated 20 June 2023.  In the Crown Report print out it is recorded that: “the initial complaint suggests the disclosure was completely out of the blue and prompted by her daughter looking anxious, biting her nails, but her statement clarifies she (C2) was specifically asked about FC1.  MC2 has stated her mind was a mess at the time of making the report to the Police, and she was under the influence of alcohol when the child made the disclosures. She has confirmed her statement is true; she asked the specific question, and also asked something along the lines of, ‘Is that why you’ve been quiet and biting your nails?’”
MC1’s CASE AND EVIDENCE
MC1 has her own vulnerabilities which required an assessment of her cognitive functioning. In January 2024, the psychologist, Dr Martha Laxton-Kane assessed the mother and provided a report which concluded the mother’s psychological assessment and score, “is at the top end of the extremely low range of intelligence and indicates that MC1 has some areas of learning difficulty and a significant cognitive impairment. MC1 will experience difficulties with processing, understanding and retaining more complex information, especially when information is presented verbally and at fast speed”. Dr Laxton-Kane identified the mother to have an uneven cognitive profile; her processing speed was an area of relative strength but an area of relative weakness is her verbal comprehension and working memory scores. When asked if she thought she had any learning difficulties, MC1 told Dr Laxton -Kane “yes because I forget things, I forget when my next court date is, I struggle to read and write as well”.  When asked about her concentration and attention span, the mother said, “half and half, better if mind focusssed, like a job interview will concentrate on that’. She said her memory was not good, forget things.” I have borne this assessment and its conclusions in mind when evaluating the mother’s evidence. The mother has litigation capacity and required, and received, the support of an intermediary when giving her oral evidence to the court.
MC1 confirmed the veracity of her written evidence. The mother does not think it is possible for FC1 to have sexually abused C2 because her evidence is that there was not an opportunity for him to have done so. When asked why she thought C2 may be lying about that, her evidence is: “ because they were never left alone apart from that one time (when she went for a job interview) and because family members have put it in her head”.  When C2 telling lies was explored further, MC1 agreed she hadn’t known C2 to lie about “really big things and MC2 has never said that C2 tells lies”.
MC1 agreed C2 stayed over at her home at weekends and “a couple of nights on a school night I took C2 to school”. The mother stated; when C2 stayed over she would sleep in the same bed as MC1. FC1 would be at his parents’ home because he was spending time with CX.
MC1 stated she moved from a two bedroom flat to a one bedroom flat in early 2023, subsequently changing her evidence to say she couldn’t remember in which month she had moved. The reason for the move was because the two bedroom flat was too big for her after CZ was removed from her care. MC1 agreed C2 stayed over when she was living in the two bed flat but denied C2 had visited or stayed over in the one bedroom flat.
MC1 agreed she is socially isolated and apart from any support provided by FC1 and his parents, the only other support she now has is from her own father who cares for her son, CY. She agreed that at the relevant time this court is dealing with in March 2023, MC2 was her only other friend and it was a good friendship.  They have now ‘fallen out’ due to these allegations being made.
MC1 agreed, prior to the allegations being made, there had been an incident at MC2’s home when FC1 had slapped or smacked MC2 on the bottom in her presence.  MC1 asserted this was because they were all “having a laugh…banter and all that” and denied MC2 had been upset by it. This contrasts with MC2’s oral evidence who was clearly not at all happy about it having occurred, and C2’s oral evidence where she states her “mum chased him down the road and she slapped him across the face because she doesn’t want him slapping her bum when he’s got a girlfriend”.
MC1 agreed she had not mentioned anything to MC2 about why CZ was no longer in her care, and also agreed she had been in town with FC1 the night CZ’s father, FCZ removed him from her care.
MC1 was asked about her relationship with FC1 and the progression of it. She agreed they had reconnected through Facebook but couldn’t be any more specific about the date than the beginning of 2022. She stated they didn’t meet up straightaway and suggested they met face to face after a month or two. When reminded FC1 had told the social worker they met up after a period of about two weeks, MC1 agreed with that timeframe.
MC1 denied being in a relationship with FC1 when CZ was removed by FCZ. MC1 asserted “No, we were not seeing each other, we were just talking”, and denied FC1 had stayed over at her flat or she had stayed over at his home at that point in the chronology. When asked how many times she had met up with FC1 face to face before CZ was removed, the mother’s evidence is: “Not a lot because we were working loads and I had my kid and I didn’t want another person around my kid”. She asserted the 2022-August-4 was the first occasion FC1 met CZ face to face and persisted in her denial FC1 had ever stayed at her flat at the weekends or prior to CZ’s removal.
MC1’s oral evidence is that after CZ was removed, FC1 stayed over one or two nights a week, on different nights each week and not every week but most weeks.
In respect of FC1’s supervised contact with CX, MC1 stated FC1 told her about the need for supervision of it after CZ was removed. The reason he gave her for the need for supervision was about the “sexual touching and feeling other young girls up”. MC1 confirmed FC1 had told her about his criminal conviction for assaulting MC3, and that there had been violence in his relationship with CX’s mother. FC1 had not told MC1 about social care conducting a risk assessment of him in June 2022 in relation to his contact with CX. MC1 confirmed she had not been worried about any of the allegations the young girls had made about FC1 even though she had thought long and hard about them and knew they were being investigated by the Police. When asked how she now felt about FC1 being around children, MC1 told the court, “Alright to be honest”.
MC1 confirmed the evidence of MC2 to be correct and she had not mentioned any of the above matters of concern about FC1 to her. MC1 agreed, as C2 was coming to her flat it was important for MC2 to know of the sexual abuse allegations but when asked why she didn’t tell her, MC1’s evidence is: “I didn’t think it was my place to say, to tell other people”. MC1 agreed, if the roles had been reversed and CZ’s father had been in a relationship with a person against whom such allegations had been made, she would want to know about them to safeguard CZ but could not explain why she failed to bring them to the attention of her only friend, MC2. Similarly, MC1 failed to tell MC2 about FC1’s convictions for violence despite agreeing she would have wanted to know about them herself if the roles had been reversed. MC1 agreed she had not told AC2 about them either.
In contrast to the above oral evidence which she gave the court, MC1 was asked about information she had provided to social care on other occasions and specifically during a Parenting Assessment conducted by a previous social worker, Kirsty Barker, the sessions for which were held between 2022-October-22 – February 2023. In it, MC1 initially denied ever being in a relationship with FC1 and referred to him as ‘a friend’. Later, she told Ms Barker that FC1 would stay at her flat at the weekend when CZ went to his father’s for contact. The mother denies saying this to Ms Barker.
In respect of FC1’s involvement with C2, MC1’s evidence to the court is that FC1 first met C2 after CZ had been removed from her care but she couldn’t be any more precise about the date. She said FC1 met C2 at her flat and said this was about “every 3 weeks”. When C2 and FC1 were there together they “had a laugh, she would be on her phone or be hyper, chase me or play hide and seek”. C2 stayed over during the week once but FC1 was not there on that occasion. MC1 recalls it because she borrowed £20 from FC1 to return C2 to school the next morning. C2 would stay over with her more during the school holidays.
MC1 was clear that FC1 only stayed over at her house on one occasion when C2 also stayed over and that was the night before MC1 went for a job interview. MC1 denied C2 was ever left alone with FC1 and asserted that on all the occasions C2 stayed with her, C2 would follow her into the bathroom whenever she went to the toilet, and if MC1 was in the bath, C2 would follow her into the bathroom and sit on the toilet seat playing on her phone.
On the day of the interview, MC1 told the court she telephoned MC2 to ask if C2 was “alright to stay with FC1 and MC2 said yes. I phoned MC2 to ask her permission and then I set off”. The interview was about 11.30am and she left her flat about 11.15am as it was only a short walk away. MC1 recalled speaking to C2 via facetime after she left the flat. When asked by Mr Taylor what were you doing when the call started, MC1 stated she was sitting on a chair at the warehouse. I infer from this reply, this was around 10-15 minutes later allowing for the time taken by MC1 to walk to the warehouse.
The job interview was cancelled at short notice as the interviewer failed to turn up, and MC1 asserted she then went to McDonalds where she met up with C2 and FC1.
MC1’ evidence then changed and she said she ‘Facetimed’ C2 whilst she was walking down to the job interview in contradiction to her first account that she had been sitting on a chair at the warehouse when the call started. When asked whether she had been on the telephone call to C2 the whole time, MC1 said “Yes, unless she put the phone down and was on the phone to her mum” which I found to be a vague not affirmative reply.
MC1 agreed she had been spoken to by a Police Officer about C2’s allegations and declined to provide a statement to them. She agreed she had signed DC Hull’s pocket notebook on the 2023-April-5 shortly after C2’s ABE interview. In it, she confirms she has provided a verbal account to PC Hull (as he then was) which states: “There has only ever  been one occasion where FC1 stayed over at the same time as C2. This was some time in winter. She and C2 slept in the only bed in the house, whereas FC1 slept on the settee. The last time C2 stayed over was two months ago. FC1 spent the night at a friend’s and returned at 0730 hours, at which time he paid for a taxi to take C2 to school….She has never left FC1 and C2 alone”.
MC1 denied ever taking C2 to FC1’s house on any occasion in contrast to what C2 told the court.
The Police evidence is that on the 2023-April-5 MC1 was approached by the police with a view to obtaining a witness statement. The mother declined to provide a witness statement because she did not wish to go to court and told the police this was because she had a lot going on with her children. The  contemporaneous, documented entry in the Police notebook on the 5 April 2023 includes the following: “She has never left FC1 and C2 alone. She did have a job interview last month, which was at Hollywood Bowl. However, C2 was not at her house at this time and so she never asked MC2 if C2 could stay with FC1”.
FC1’S CASE and EVIDENCE
FC1 has always denied being the perpetrator of any sexual abuse. He is entitled to rely upon those denials unless the local authority can prove otherwise.
I have reminded myself there is no burden placed upon FC1 to provide any explanation at all for why C2 may have fabricated these allegations against him, and it is for the local authority to prove its case. Notwithstanding that important legal principle, the father has provided the following explanations when invited to do so:-
FC1 was interviewed by the police on Wednesday 2023-March-29 and stated he knew nothing about C2’s allegations until ‘Saturday night’.  In his police interview he suggests the reason the allegations have been made by C2 is because: “one of her family members knows from my last period of when I got accused of it – it was MC3…I knew they’d been talking about me already, so it’s like they were trying to get into the kids heads ‘Has he touched you?’ I don’t know”. FC1 suggests MC2 and her brother’s partner (AC2) have been “talking to MC3’s aunty because I’ve already been accused of it already. Well, I’ve already been done before for touching a child. Well no, I’ve got accused and they’re trying to say that I’m not allowed  my kid and stuff like that”.
When asked about any time he had spent with C2 he told the police he was hardly ever there when C2 visited MC1 because he would be at home spending time with his own daughter between Friday – Sunday. He stated C2 only stayed over at MC1’s at the weekend or if she was off school, which is consistent with MC2’s account. He said, the closest he has been to C2 was “a couple of times when MC1 was there, she was colouring my tattoos in”. C2 told the court about colouring in FC1’s tattoos and agreed she had done this with some scented colouring pens and said it happened “about two times”.
FC1 told the police he has only stayed overnight at MC1’s when C2 has been there on one occasion. When asked when this was, he initially states: “I don’t know what date, I can’t remember, I think it was a couple of weeks ago. It wasn’t recent because I haven’t seen C2 for a bit”.  Later in his interview he changed his account and asserts “I haven’t stayed at MC1’s for about a month…something like a month and a half.”
When asked by the Police if he has ever been left alone with C2, the father’s reply is “Probably only when MC1’s gone to the toilet or something like that. Like I say I don’t always stay there long. Like I say, C2 only comes on a weekend and I have to stop at my mum’s because I have my daughter. It’s like only the odd time when I see C2. So it might be only when MC1’s gone to the toilet. MC1’s never been in the bath on her own while C2’s been there”. I pause to note that the mother denied C2 was ever left alone with FC1 even whilst she used the toilet, and in his oral evidence the father echoed the mother’s evidence and told the court: “No she (C2) always went to the toilet with MC1” and denied any recollection of what he had told the Police: “ No, I can’t remember that, she would follow MC1 all the time” and he couldn’t explain why he gave the Police a different version.
FC1 denied ever being left alone with C2 on any occasion at all. His firm response to the Police when specifically asked about caring for C2 whilst MC1 went for a job interview is: “No, no. She’s never, ever been left alone with me. Never.”
In his statement filed at court dated 2024-October-30, FC1 gives a different explanation to the one he gave to the Police and to the allocated social worker, Ms Sarah Onyon about being left alone with C2. He concedes he was left alone with C2 on the occasion MC1 went for a job interview. His explanation for his changing account is: “Upon further considering my police interview at H369- H389 I have noticed an error in one of my replies. At H388 I was asked by the Police whether I had ever been left alone with C2 whilst MC1 went to a job interview….it was only after I was going through the transcript of the interview a week later did MC1 notice the error and remind me that she went for a job interview in approximately February 2023 and that there was a short moment when me and C2 were at home”.
In his oral evidence, FC1 initially stated in cross examination he hadn’t seen C2 very often, only ‘a couple of times’. It was pointed out to him that in his Police interview he had told them he saw C2 ‘once every two weeks’ which would suggest a higher frequency than ‘a couple of times’. FC1 explained he gave this answer because he hadn’t seen C2 in person but used to see her in the background when he ‘facetimed MC1 and stuff’ and was including these occasions. He was then reminded he told the Police he had seen C2 “about 10 times”  and his oral evidence changed to: “Yes, sommat like that, roughly”. Which is a significant increase to that which he was initially prepared to admit.
FC1 was asked how many times he had stayed over at MC1’s home when C2 was there and he insisted it was only once, the night preceding the mother’s job interview which was also the occasion when C2 coloured in the tattoos on his arm. FC1 was asked about the different answer he gave the Police when he described staying over on a Saturday night and then getting up on the Sunday morning and taking C2 to a park with MC1 with no mention of the job interview. His evidence then changed and he said “Yes, I got mixed up with that one” and he denied staying overnight on that occasion and stated he couldn’t recall telling the Police that version even though it is contained in the audio and transcript of his interview. FC1 denied trying to minimize the number of occasions he had spent with C2 or the number of opportunities he had to spend time with her on his own.
FC1 was asked about the information he gave to Sarah Onyon; The unchallenged evidence of Ms Onyon is that FC1 provided her with identical information to that which he gave the Police when she was conducting her parenting assessment of FC1 in 2023.  There were four assessment sessions held with FC1 in November 2023 and during one of these occasions the information he provided was: “Regarding the most recent allegations in 2023 involving a 10 year old girl, FC1 stated he had socialised on a few occasions with the child’s mother, her partner and MC1. He and MC1 took the girl as well as his daughter out for a meal once without the child’s mother (MC2). He originally stated that he had only met the child ‘on a couple of occasions at the weekend’ (when he was not seeing his own daughter) at MC1’s home and denied he had ever been left alone with her. He then stated the girl would often ask when ‘FC1 was coming over’ and once she sat next to him and coloured in his arm tattoo with her colouring pens. It was proposed to FC1 that given these comments it would suggest she had spent more time with him than a couple of occasions to feel comfortable around him or ask after him, FC1 then said he would go round during the week to MC1’s home”.   When asked why he gave Ms Onyon this information if it was not true, and why not inform Ms Onyon he had seen C2 at least 10 times? His answer was “I don’t know why”.
ANALYSIS
ASSESSMENT OF THE CREDIBILITY AND RELIABILITY OF THE PARENTS AND OTHER WITNESSES
I consider an appropriate place to start is with an evaluation of the reliability of the parents’ evidence.
MC1’s Credibility and Reliability
The local authority concedes the mother’s recollection of times and dates and her ability to orientate herself in time is extremely limited, and I also factor into my conclusions the opinion of Dr Laxton-Kane about the mother’s cognitive deficits and vulnerabilities. There are, however, features of this case where I am persuaded the mother has not been truthful or given a consistent account which go beyond that which may be expected to arise from her cognitive abilities. These include, but are not limited to, the nature and progression of her relationship with FC1.
On the 2022-August-15 the mother was interviewed by the Police in respect of the troubling bruise to CZ’s face. She told the Police she had known FC1 for six to seven months but they were not dating, he does not stay at her house and they are just friends.  She tells the Police the day in question (2022-August-4) is the first occasion CZ had met FC1. The mother repeated this account in her oral evidence to the court during this hearing. This is in contrast to the oral evidence of FC1, and the written statement of CZ’s father, dated 12 September 2022 when he told the Police what FC1 said to him on the 4th August: “MC1 seemed to be ok with me taking him, she didn’t really seem bothered by this, but FC1 got aggressive with me, he came up to me while I was holding CZ and told me I had no right in taking him and then he said he stays at MC1’s when CZ is there.” There has been no reason advanced by MC1 for why FCZ would say that unless it was the truth.
MC1 also told the social worker, Kirsty Barker during her parenting assessment in 2022 that FC1 would stay at her flat at the weekend when CZ went to his father’s for contact. This has to have pre-dated the 2022-August-4 as CZ has lived with his father since that date. Even though the mother denies saying this Ms Barker I find that she did and prefer the contemporaneous recording of it. I can identify no reason for why Ms Barker would invent it and none has been suggested. I have taken into account the mother may struggle with identifying specific dates but I find she is being dishonest when she asserts FC1 did not stay at her flat when CZ was there regardless of the date, that he did not stay overnight when CZ was at his father’s house, and that FC1 never stayed with her at the weekends. I find that he did.
I have considered the relevance of this lie when evaluating the mother’s evidence regarding her assertion FC1 has never been left alone with C2. I am persuaded the most likely explanation for it is the one advanced by the local authority, that MC1 was trying to minimize her own involvement with FC1 in 2022 and his involvement with CZ out of her wish to have CZ returned to her care. I consider it likely she has adopted a similar approach to minimize his involvement with C2 in order to have C1 returned to her care. I am reinforced in reaching this conclusion for the following reasons.
Firstly, despite accepting she knew about FC1’s convictions for violence and the allegations against him of sexual abuse made by other girls, she did not believe them at the time she was told about them in 2022 and she does not hold any concerns about them now.  I cannot identify any reason why she would not permit C2 to be alone with FC1 when she does not consider he poses any risk to a child.
Secondly, MC1 accepted in her oral evidence she spoke to MC2 prior to attending her job interview in February 2023 to seek her permission to leave C2 alone in the care of FC1. I cannot identify any reason why she would have done this unless that is exactly what she intended to do and did do. I prefer and I am persuaded by MC2’s evidence that C2 was left alone with FC1 when she states: “The last time C2 stayed over at MC1’s was in February 2023. I remember I phoned C2 in the morning. I asked her where auntie MC1 was, and she said that she’d gone to an interview at a warehouse. She said that FC1 was looking after her”. In her oral evidence MC2 recalled this conversation and said “I think it was a telephone call (not a video call), if I’m right it were in the morning, she told me that MC1 had gone for an interview and she were alone with FC1”. MC2 was quite right, it did take place in the morning and I cannot fault her recollection.
On the 2024-September-4, the mother filed her response to the amended final threshold.  In it she addresses the issue of whether FC1 had been left alone with C2.  She states; “The mother cannot remember any occasion when C2 was alone with FC1. When the mother had a bath the night before the interview C2 was in the bathroom the whole time with her. C2 had a bath straight after the mother. The mother can remember on the day she went to her interview she was on Facetime to C2 on her entire journey walking to the interview and whilst she was waiting for the interview. No one turned up for the interview and facetime continued between C2 and the mother until C2 and FC1 arrived at McDonalds as they had walked to meet her and they had food together”.
I do not accept this account because there were holes and inconsistencies in MC1’s oral evidence when she was questioned about it. She sought to suggest C2 hadn’t really been left on her own with FC1 on the morning of the interview because she had been on a Facetime call to C2 throughout.  I am persuaded this was not the case and MC1 was unreliable about where she was when the call started and whether C2 called her own mother in the middle of it. MC1’s account is also inconsistent with FC1’s written statement where he asserts “MC1 left the flat in a rush to go to the job interview and C2 phoned her mother, MC2…after calling her mother, C2 video called MC1” FC1 also asserts the Facetime call ended whilst he and C2 were in the park and he describes another gap in time of 5 – 10 minutes when MC1 is not in contact with C2. The two versions are inconsistent and this causes me to doubt the veracity of both parents’ versions.
DC Hull spoke to the mother on the 2023-April-5 which was the week after C2 made her allegations and not long after MC1 had attended for the aborted interview at the warehouse. She told DC Hull that C2 had never been left alone with FC1 at a time when the events were much more recent for her to recollect than they are now or even in October 2024. I infer she did not tell DC Hull any of the above information about being in constant contact with C2 via the Facetime call because there is no record of it in DC Hull’s pocket notebook. I am persuaded MC1 was not open and honest with DC Hull when she said C2 had never been left alone with FC1 whether this was because she was on the toilet, having a bath, in the living room or at an interview, and this was an attempt by her to place distance between FC1 and C2.
I have considered whether MC1’s dishonesty with DC Hull was a consequence of anything said or done to her by FC1 in the period between giving his Police interview and her speaking to DC Hull and declining to give a Criminal Justice Act statement. I have determined, on reflection, the evidence heard by the court at this hearing does not currently permit such a finding as it was not sought by the local authority nor was it fully explored in the oral evidence. When asked, the mother denied being told what to say by FC1.
Thirdly, the mother’s version is also in direct contrast to C2’s evidence, which I prefer for reasons I will come to in due course.
In summary, I do not find the mother to be a credible witness. I am persuaded that she has been dishonest about the occasions and opportunities FC1 has spent with C2 on her own in the same way she has demonstrated her dishonesty about the occasions and opportunities he spent with CZ. The mother does not suggest her decision to say these things is attributable to FC1 and I conclude on the evidence available to the court at this hearing it was a matter of her own personal choice to mislead the court.
FC1’s Credibility and Reliability
In his oral evidence there were many examples where FC1 gave inconsistent explanations and accounts to the one he has given previously. In firm but fair cross examination by Mr Pallo, FC1 had little option but to concede he has given conflicting accounts to the Police and Social Care on many important issues.  I am persuaded FC1 has told so many lies he struggles to remember which versions he has told to who. It meant each time he was asked a question his answer changed as he struggled to find explanations to fit the evidence. I formed the view that the longer I listened to his evidence, the less credible it became. It persuaded me his denial of C2’s allegations could not be relied upon. In addition to those issues set out above regarding C2, other issues he has previously been dishonest about included but were not limited to the following.
In his oral evidence he initially stated he reconnected with MC1 via Facebook at the start of 2022 and first met CZ on the 2022-August-4, the day CZ was removed from the mother’s care which was also the version the mother advanced in her own evidence. He stated he had met MC1 face to face before that date when CZ was staying with his father, FCZ but he couldn’t recall where or when.
In the pre-birth Parenting Assessment of FC1 in respect of C1 dated 2023-December-6, FC1 gave a different account. His assessment sessions were held on the 7th, 15th and 2023-November-20 in addition to some sessions held in July and August. In them, he told Ms Onyon he reconnected with MC1 via Facebook in 2021 and they met face to face about 2 weeks later, he said MC1 brought CZ with her. When this was put to him, FC1’s evidence changed to “I can’t remember” but he continued to deny he had met MC1 or CZ in 2021.
When FC1 was interviewed by the Police in respect of C2’s allegations on the 2023-March-29, he told the Police officers “I’ve been with MC1 for a year and a half, I can’t say really” which would be consistent with Ms Onyon’s recording of their relationship starting in 2021, and for this reason I prefer Ms Onyon’s more accurate and contemporaneous recording. I conclude FC1 is being dishonest with the court when he advanced a different date in his oral evidence.
FC1 told the court he “started staying overnight at MC1’s flat when CZ got took off her, that night, that was the first time I stayed over. No I didn’t stay over at any weekends at all because I had my daughter at weekends”.
FC1 was then reminded  about the information MC1 had given to Kirsty Barker in her parenting assessment in June 2023 namely, that FC1 would stay over at her flat when CZ was with FCZ for the weekend. FC1’s evidence then changed and he agreed he had started staying over at MC1’s flat before CZ was removed but continued to deny staying there whilst CZ was present and he said “most of the time I stopped there during the week” as opposed to his earlier assertion of having never stayed at the weekends at all (my emphasis added). He asserted the only time he had seen CZ prior to the 2022-August-4 had been in the background of a video call with MC1 and he had never met him face to face before that date.
In FC1’s police interview on the 2023-March-28, he told the Police he and MC1 would take CZ and C2 to play outside on the grass together when the sun was out. This had to have pre-dated 2022-August-4 as MC1 has only had supervised contact with CZ since that date. It evidences another lie told by FC1 to the Police in his August 2022 interview.
When questioned in cross examination about the events of the 2022-August-4, FC1 agreed he and MC1 had agreed to meet up ‘in town’ and they were going out for a meal together. He agreed he was interviewed by the Police on the 2022-August-15 about the bruise to CZ’s face, and the court has a copy of the transcript of this interview.
In that interview with the Police, FC1 denied ever having stayed at MC1’s flat, he asserted they were ‘just friends’, and he told them that this occasion (2022-August-4) was the first time they had met up: “That were first time, since I, since I’ve known her really, basically”. When asked by Mr Pallo why he lied to the Police about these things in his interview, his reply was, “It wasn’t a lie, I thought we were talking about CZ and stuff. I should have said I have stopped (at the flat)”. He accepted he hadn’t told the truth about it being the first time he had met up with MC1 and stated: “I weren’t lying really, I should have said I’ve seen her more than once or more than twice”.
In the same interview, FC1 told the Police he and MC1 were ‘just good friends’, and he just ‘bumped into her in town”. FC1 had to concede this was also a lie because he had pre-planned to meet up with MC1 and CZ to have a meal but stated: “No I wasn’t trying to downplay anything. I was trying to be honest and to tell the truth. There’s nothing that I need to lie about”.
In August 2022 FC1 is asked by the Police whether he knew MC1’s address. He denies he does and says: “I’ve never been to her house she’s never been to my house……No. I don’t even know her address, I know she lives somewhere down [redacted], that’s all I know, but near [redacted] near [redacted]. I don’t know the actual where it is from there.” this is another lie because he did know where it was and he had stayed over at MC1’s flat on more than one occasion at that point in the chronology.
I do not accept FC1’s repeated assertion he did not lie to the Police in August 2022, I am persuaded he told a great many lies to the Police in that interview at a time when he knew them to be lies. FC1 has been interviewed by the Police and convicted of criminal offences on more than one occasion, he is well aware of the importance of giving a truthful and accurate account to them. I am persuaded the most likely explanation for telling those lies deliberately was to minimize his connection to both MC1 and to CZ, and to obstruct or distract the Police investigation away from himself at a time when he knew social care’s risk assessment for the time he spends with his daughter, CX recommended only supervised contact with a child. During that risk assessment, dated June 2022, FC1 had denied being in a relationship with anyone. By the end of his oral evidence I was persuaded FC1 is an accomplished liar and has no difficulty at all with giving the Police, social care and this court his version of the truth that he wants others to hear.
I take this into account when evaluating what FC1 told the Police in his interview in March 2023 in respect of the number of occasions he had met C2, initially suggesting it was only couple of times before increasing this to ten, and seeking to mislead them by asserting he had ‘never ever’ been alone with her when I consider he knew that he had. I do not accept the account put forward by FC1 that it was a genuine mistake to have suggested otherwise to the Police because he had forgotten about being left alone with C2 on the morning of MC1’s job interview and wasn’t reminded of this by MC1 until much later in 2024. I do not accept this because FC1 is a person who systematically lies to the Police and to people in authority and only admits to the truth when he has little option but to do so. I prefer the evidence of MC2 and C2 on these issues.
I have taken into consideration the fact the parents have lied about FC1 spending time alone with C2 does not mean they have lied about everything else and it does not of itself equate to proof of guilt where C2’s allegations are concerned. I am persuaded however, that this lie was told deliberately by both parents; it is relevant to the material issue of whether FC1 had the opportunity to assault C2 sexually; the motive for telling it was the realization of that fact; and it is demonstrated to be lie by MC2’s and C2’s evidence and by the parents’ belated admission C2 was left alone with FC1 on the morning of MC1’s job interview. C2 could not possibly have known in March 2023 that on one of the occasions she said she was sexually assaulted by FC1 would subsequently turn out to be the sole occasion FC1 admits to being alone with her over 18 months later in October 2024.
I am persuaded the parents’ lies are fundamentally capable of corroborating C2’s own personal account and are supportive of FC1 having behaved as C2 has described.
C2’s Credibility and Reliability
I have carefully evaluated C2’s ABE Interview, which in turn involves scrutiny of the events which led up to its creation, and consideration of whether the conduct of professionals and/or family members involved at that time fell so far below the standard expected by the relevant guidance that the reliability of the interview and C2’s evidence is impaired.
In his written submissions, Mr Taylor makes a number of criticisms of the events which preceded C2 giving her ABE interview. It is correct there is no contemporaneous record of what was said by C2 in the bathroom on the evening of the 2023-March-24. It is agreed MC2 initiated this conversation with a direct question following on from what she had conveyed to her by LS via AC2. It is correct there is no account of how long this conversation took or what may have been said to C2 before the Police arrived on the 2023-March-28 to make the first ‘independent’ recording of C2’s allegations. I have also weighed in the balance the inconsistencies in MC2’s account about C2 biting her nails. I do not consider it is necessary to address each point raised in detail save to conclude I am persuaded the process is not fatally flawed and the evidence of C2 and MC2 is reliable for the following reasons.
Firstly, I have considered what opportunity existed for C2 to have been suggestible and influenced into adopting false allegations against FC1 as her own personal experience. I have concluded there was little to none and certainly none that was taken. It is agreed that prior to the evening of Friday 2023-March-24, there is no evidence MC2 knew of any previous sexual abuse allegations against FC1 and there was no evidence AC2 did either. The only person who knew of them was LS and there is no evidence she shared this information prior to that night. Therefore, there was no opportunity to discuss the previous sexual abuse allegations made by other girls with C2 prior to this night.
AC2 thought C2 was not in the same room when LS gave MC2 and AC2 the information via her phone via the loudspeaker but C2 confirms hearing it on a loudspeaker and I prefer C2’s evidence on this issue to be more reliable. There is no reason why she should invent it and I proceed on the basis C2 did overhear firsthand some of what LS said but I do not consider this taints C2’s evidence in anyway.
The evidence is that thereafter, there was barely any time at all before MC2 spoke to C2 in the bathroom and directly asks C2 whether ‘FC1 has touched her’. MC2 received an immediate affirmative response from C2. I accept this response would have been devastating for MC2 to receive and not what she wanted to hear. It is likely she would have had difficulty digesting and accepting this answer whether she had consumed alcohol or not. I have been persuaded there was little to no opportunity between receiving the information via LS and C2 giving her affirmative reply for anyone to encourage, suggest, fabricate, indoctrinate or to otherwise persuade C2 to make a false allegation against FC1. I accept it was the answer C2 gave her mother because I cannot identify any reason for why MC2 would have invented such an unwelcome and distressing reply unless it is what C2 told her.
I have considered carefully that C2’s initial complaint to her mother is in response to a direct question and was not volunteered by C2 but there is no evidence it was asked with any preconceived ideas, pressure, threats or encouragement for C2 to respond in any particular way by MC2.
Secondly, I am further persuaded to reach this conclusion by the following facts.
MC2 was a good and loyal friend to MC1 who, at that time, was her only friend. MC2 had no reason to doubt, question or worry about FC1 or MC1 prior to this event and there is no evidence she had any hidden agenda to invent such allegations against FC1 or to inculcate such an idea into C2’s head. Whilst there is an incident where FC1 slapped or smacked MC2 across the bottom which was not welcomed by her, it has not been suggested by the parents this was a reason for MC2 to encourage C2 to make false allegations. The parents’ version of this incident is that it was a ‘joke’ and ‘banter’. I do not accept it may be so easily dismissed in that way and is more likely to be another example of inappropriate sexual boundaries being crossed by FC1. I prefer the evidence of C2 and MC2 on this issue.
I formed the impression that MC2 is a devoted and loving mother to C2 who even on the night in question asked FC1 to tell her the allegation wasn’t true. MC2 was desperate for reassurance to believe it had not happened and this persuades me it is highly unlikely she would have sought to harm her daughter by reinforcing or suggesting false memories, even unwittingly.
It is likely the atmosphere in MC2’s family home changed after C2 made her allegations from the happy family gathering which had prevailed earlier that evening. But there is no evidence to suggest this contributed to any imagined experience by C2 or that C2 was influenced by that environment. The change in environment was a response to C2’s allegations not the precursor of them.
There is no evidence that between the 24/25 March 2023 and C2 being spoken to by the Police that MC2 repeatedly questioned C2 in detail about her allegations and nor did C2’s father, FC2 do so. On behalf of FC1, Mr Taylor invites the court to speculate there probably were such conversations but I do not accept that invitation.  This court acts on the evidence not on speculation or suspicion.
Finally, I take into account the evidence in this case about the changes in C2’s presentation which have been noticeable to MC2, AC2, KMH, and NR. The changes are not sufficiently specific to enable me to conclude they are directly attributable to C2 being sexually abused by FC1 because she would bite her nails prior to MC1 meeting FC1, but they are supportive of, and consistent with, C2’s account about what has happened and lend credence to it for this reason.
I have considered the evidence gathered by DC Hull and DC Barratt on the 28th March both at MC2’s home and by conducting the ABE interview itself. In cross examination of DC Hull, Mr Taylor criticized him for asking too many questions of C2 at MC2’s home and not asking enough questions to explore C2’s responses in her ABE interview.  I consider there is a balance to be struck when questioning a child and the need for the child to be given “the maximum possible opportunity to recall freely, uninhibited by questions, what they are able to say and equally it is vital that a careful note is taken of what they say and also of any questions they are asked. (Footnote: 1)” I am satisfied DC Barratt did comply with this and recorded the questions DC Hull asked C2 at her family home together with her replies. The contemporaneous written note indicates an exchange which, when read aloud, takes less than three minutes to repeat. I reject any suggestion it was too long or inappropriately conducted by the nature of the questions asked.
Similarly, there are always more questions a child could be asked in interview and a decision has to be made about when to stop. I have also taken into account an intermediary was not used by the Police which may have clarified and/or amplified further some of the responses C2 gave, nor are there any notes of the pre-interview planning process. But I have been persuaded there is insufficient evidence to conclude the Police Officers have deviated from the guidelines to such an extent that it impairs the reliability of C2’s ABE interview taken as a whole. There is no evidence upon which the court could conclude DC Hull, or DC Helen Barratt who has provided her written evidence, are anything other than honest and credible witnesses who were doing their best to assist the court and the criminal investigation.
I am persuaded the guidance referred to by MacDonald J in AS v TH and Re P above has been adequately followed, and whilst it may not have been perfection because there is not a contemporaneous note of every conversation available for the court to evaluate, and the ABE interview may have been improved had the Police used an intermediary in accordance with the guidelines, one has to have a sense of realism and accept when a child is speaking in a free flow narrative it is simply not always possible to achieve perfection.
Having considered the totality of the evidence I have been persuaded the events and process which led up to the creation of the ABE Interview and the conduct of the interview itself  do not cause it to be fatally flawed and the contents of C2’s ABE interview and her oral evidence are reliable.
In considering the evidence the court has from C2 I have reminded myself that whilst C2 has given oral evidence herself and had her account subjected to cross-examination, the court weighs and considers her evidence in the same way as any other witness, there is no extra weight or special treatment of it simply because she is a child.
There has been no dispute, if the court accepts C2’s allegations in her oral evidence and her ABE interview to be the truth, that the facts pleaded by the local authority are established and the threshold for intervention is crossed. This constitutes both actual significant sexual and emotional harm being caused to a child by FC1, and gives rise to a likelihood of future sexual harm which is attributable to the care provided by him.
I am persuaded C2 is not a suggestible child but an intelligent one, and there is a paucity of evidence to persuade me anyone has suggested to C2 she was sexually assaulted by FC1 which she has then adopted or embellished as a personal experience. C2’s account is detailed and has remained consistent on the occasions she has been asked about it or chosen to repeat it. There is no evidence she has ever resiled or deviated from it and she does not exaggerate it to suggest penetration has taken place when asked about this.  When asked what she meant by “loads of times” in cross examination, she explained it meant four times which is plausible and consistent with FC1 accepting he had seen C2 on about ‘ten occasions’ which gave him the opportunity to assault her on four occasions. C2 is able to link the commencement of FC1’s sexual abuse to the time when CZ was removed from MC1, and when DC Hull in the ABE interview makes a mistake about the date it started, C2 corrects him so that her account remains consistent, she does not adopt what he suggests:
Q: Ok, did any part go inside your private parts that time?
A: C2 shakes her head.
Q: No, Ok. You said earlier, he’s done it loads of times since February
A: Not February, August.
When describing where she was laid on the bed and where FC1 was lying, C2 is able to demonstrate where each of them were and which way they were facing. When describing which part of FC1’s hand could she feel, C2 is spontaneously able to point to the palm part of her hand where contact was made as well as with his fingers. All of these details add authenticity to C2’s account.
C2 has described the occasions when she was left alone with FC1, either by FC1 following her into the bedroom and MC1 being in the living room, being alone with him whilst MC1 was in the bath, or when MC1 left them alone together when she went to  her job interview. On each occasion FC1 saw and used it as an opportunity to assault C2 sexually. I am persuaded MC1 well knew of these opportunities even though she did not know what FC1 was doing and she has chosen to lie and conceal them. In doing so, it persuades me she chose to prioritise her relationship with FC1.
C2 has described FC1 instructing her not to tell her own parents about his sexual abuse of her and, until asked a direct question by MC2, she complied with his instructions. This is plausible and it is well known this is how abusers operate in an environment of silence.
FC1 told the Police about his heightened sense of vigilance and caution which he felt compelled to exercise in his behaviour when he was around CX. He told them he no longer changed her nappy and did not allow her to ‘twirl’ near him in case it was misconstrued. He told the police about how the allegations made by C3 had affected him and his interaction with CX. He said people were saying to him he should permit CX to dance with him, yet his fear of another false allegation being made against him prevented him from doing so. In contrast, with C2, a child who he initially asserted he had met on only two occasions, he engaged with playfighting, hugging, and allowed her to be in sufficient physical proximity to colour in his tattoos. He agreed to care for her on his own whilst MC1 went for a job interview. This inconsistency of attitude and approach between C2 and CX is consistent with FC1 normalising C2 into accepting physical contact and in due course, sexual touching. I do not accept FC1 has only met C2 twice or even ‘about 10 times’ as he asserts. C2 is described as a quiet, shy child until she gets to know a person well, and the familiarity of her behaviour with FC1 which MC1 and FC1 describe is consistent with a degree of far greater contact than they are prepared to admit to.
When C2 was subjected to questioning in court, she continued to maintain her account and rejected any suggestion she was guessing or that FC1’s denials were truthful. Her response when asked why she continued to visit MC1’s flat if FC1 was ‘touching her down below’ is: “because I didn’t know he was going to do it over and over again”   and is, in my judgment, one of the most spontaneous, compelling, and truthful replies in this entire case.
MC2’s Credibility and Reliability
I am persuaded MC2 is a credible and reliable witness. When giving evidence she was honest and forthright despite being understandably distressed by the subject matter. Initially, she did not wish to complete her evidence and had to be persuaded to do so by the use of a witness summons. There is no evidence to suggest she is a person who wished to participate in these proceedings as part of any personal vendetta against FC1 or MC1. In evaluating her evidence as a whole I do not consider any discrepancy between the initial police recording made at 11.30am on the 2023-March-25 and her statement made to the Police in June 2023 undermines her evidence.
The written statement before the court submitted by DC Barratt dated 2024-October-7 sets out the information given by MC2 to her and DC Hull on the 2023-March-28. In that conversation, DC Barratt confirms MC2 told them she had received a text from her sister in law (AC2) which prewarned her about FC1, and that she took C2 upstairs and questioned her which caused C2 to burst out crying and confirm she had been touched ‘down there’ indicating her vagina, and that he had gone down her trousers ‘skin to skin’. This account is consistent with MC2’s oral evidence and with C2’s, and with AC2’s. I find it an accurate and truthful account which is entirely consistent with C2’s evidence even though MC2 could not have known what C2 told the Police on the same date. I am persuaded that if any inconsistency in MC2’s initial reporting exists, it is more likely to be attributable to her ‘mind being a mess’ as she said in her evidence as she struggled with the shock of processing the information C2 gave her.
Conclusion
In conclusion, I have been persuaded C2 is, on the balance of probabilities, a person who is telling the truth and the local authority is entitled to the Findings it seeks.  I make each of those findings which are on the threshold schedule as pleaded, later amended to reflect the evidence in this case and set out below, and that schedule is approved in satisfaction of the section 31 statutory criteria.
In accordance with FPR Part 12 Chapter 7 and Practice Direction 12G, the local authority shall provide a copy of this judgment to the South Yorkshire Police for the purpose of any criminal investigation and/or the Crown Prosecution Service to enable it to discharge its functions under any enactment, whether by pursuing criminal charges or any sexual harm prevention order.
I remind the parties this is a final determination of these facts which are sought as part of the threshold criteria in this case and, for that reason, any application for leave to appeal must be made within 21 days following the handing down of this judgment. In accordance with the judgment of McFarlane LJ, and now President, in Re H (Children) [2015] EWCA Civ 583 the order of the court made on the 2025-January-9 will have this reminder recorded on the face of it.
H.H. JUDGE MARSON
2025-January-9
THE SCHEDULE OF FACTS APPROVED BY THE COURT TO SATISFY THE SECTION 31 STATUTORY CRITERIA
The Court finds the threshold criteria contained in section 31 of the Children Act 1989 to be satisfied, and at the time the local authority intervened to protect C1 there is a likelihood he will suffer significant harm and the likelihood of harm is attributable to the care likely to be given to him by his parents, not being care that is reasonable to expect a parent to give.
The significant harm likely to be suffered by C1 is physical, sexual, and emotional harm to his welfare arising from the following facts:
Physical and Emotional Harm by the Mother
The mother, MC1 is a perpetrator of physical abuse. Her older two children are not in her care, CY was removed in 2009 and CZ in August 2022.
The court found on the 2010-October-1 that the mother was the most likely perpetrator of an inflicted bite mark on CY’s left buttock. This would have caused CY significant pain.
CZ was seen with a concerning bruise to his face in June 2022. MC1 failed to seek appropriate medical advice in respect of this injury.
Sexual and Emotional Harm by the Father
The father, FC1 is a perpetrator of sexual abuse to a child under the age of 13 years. This gives rise to a likelihood of sexual harm to C1 and of C1 witnessing such behaviour which is likely to cause him emotional harm. The acts of sexual abuse perpetrated by FC1 occurred in the home where FC1 was living and on some occasions MC1 was present in the home but not in the same room. The presence of MC1 in the home was not sufficient to deter FC1 from committing sexual assaults upon a child.
C2
In August 2022, following CZ being removed from the care of MC1, FC1 touched C2, a child then aged 9 years, on her ‘private parts’ (vagina) above and beneath her underwear. This occurred in MC1’s home whilst MC1 was elsewhere in the home. FC1 told the child not to tell her mum or dad about it, and told her that MC1 did not know about it;
On two further occasions which occurred in February 2023; one when MC1 was in the bath, and one when MC1 was out of the home attending an interview, FC1 got under the bed covers with C2 while he was wearing just shorts and put his hands on her private parts (vagina) underneath her pants having unzipped the ‘onesie’  she was wearing.
Physical and Emotional Harm by the Father
FC1 displays behaviour which would compromise his ability to offer safe and consistent care to C1. This means C1 is likely to suffer physical and/or emotional harm as a result of his father’s behaviour;
FC1 struggles with his anger; he has punched the TV at MCX’s home, and pulled down a wardrobe and lightshade at MC3’s home when drunk.
On New Year’s Eve 2020/21 FC1 accused MC3 of cheating on him and assaulted her. This led to his criminal conviction for assault occasioning actual bodily harm. FC1 demonstrates abusive behaviour against women with whom he is in an intimate relationship.

DECISION
Introduction
The Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme (“CJRS”) was introduced following the lockdown announced on 23 March 2020. The CJRS provided funding for employers who furloughed their employees during lockdown rather than making them redundant.
Convergence Management Consultants Ltd (“CMC”) has a single director and employee, Mr Mahmood.  Between 2012 and 2017 CMC had intermittently paid a salary to Mr Mahmood; these payments were recorded on CMC’s Real Time Information (“RTI”) returns.  CMC did not pay Mr Mahmood any salary between July 2017 and the end of March 2020.
Between April 2020 and September 2021, CMC reported Mr Mahmood’s salary on its RTI returns, and made related CJRS claims totalling £46,619.48.  After the CJRS closed, CMS did not pay Mr Mahmood any further salary.
Mr Mahmood submitted that CMC was entitled to claim CJRS because the claim was based on the salary to which he was “reasonably entitled”.  The factual basis for his submission was that in 2019-2020 he had a salary of £40,000 pa from a different employer (which had made him redundant in December 2019).  The legal basis was that the law defined the “expenditure to be reimbursed” under the CJRS as “the gross amount of earnings paid or reasonably expected to be paid by the employer to an employee”.
The Tribunal decided that the provision on which Mr Mahmood had relied was not relevant to the issue of whether an employer was entitled to make a claim; instead, it set out requirements as to what could be claimed by employers who met the entitlement conditions.
In addition to the submissions made by Mr Mahmood, the Tribunal also considered the Fifth Direction, which applied from 1 November 2020 to 31 March 2021.  That Direction opened the CJRS to certain employees who had not received a salary in 2019-20, but who were paid after lockdown began. However, those rules did not apply to employees who had previously received a payment reported on an RTI return.  Mr Mahmood had been paid by CMC in previous years and those payments had been reported to HMRC on CMC’s RTI returns.  As a result, CMC was not entitled to include Mr Mahmood in a CJRS claim made under the Fifth Direction.
The rules changed again in the Sixth and the Seventh Direction.  Although we considered those amendments, we found that they not assist CMC.
We therefore refused CMC’s appeal and confirmed the assessments.
Evidence
The Tribunal was provided with a bundle of 586 pages, which included:
correspondence between the parties, and between the parties and the Tribunal;
minutes of a meeting between Mr Mahmood and Mr Declan Douglas, HMRC’s investigating officer;
various internal printouts from HMRC’s system;
CMC’s unaudited Financial Statements for the years ended June 2019, June 2020 (as amended), June 2021, June 2022 and June 2023;
guidance issued by the government about the CJRS; and
various statements from CMC’s bank account.
Mr McCabe’s skeleton argument attached various documents from HMRC’s system relating to Ocean Network Express (Europe) Limited (“Ocean Network”), the company which previously employed Mr Mahmood. These documents were provided at Mr Mahmood’s request and we admitted them.
Mr Mahmood’s skeleton argument included both evidence and submissions, and he also gave evidence orally in the course of the hearing.  He was cross-examined by Mr McCabe and answered questions from the Tribunal.  He gave credible and straightforward answers to most of the questions, although he was unable to answer those about CMC’s financial accounts, see §19.
Mr Douglas provided a witness statement, and was tendered as a witness, but Mr Mahmood declined to carry out a cross-examination.  The evidence in Mr Douglas’s statement was thus accepted.
On the basis of the evidence summarised above, we make the findings of fact below, none of which was in dispute.
Facts
CMC was established in 2007. At all relevant times, Mr Mahmood was its only shareholder, director and employee. Its principal activity is the provision of information technology (“IT”) consultancy services.
In addition to his employment and directorship of CMC, in 2019 Mr Mahmood was employed by Ocean Network as an IT consultant.  He was paid a salary of £40,000 per annum.  The employment came to an end on 19 December 2019.
CMC submitted RTI returns for Mr Mahmood, which show that he was paid intermittently and occasionally.  Ignoring pence for all but the relevant period, the RTI returns show that:
In October 2012 Mr Mahmood was paid £1,114.
In November 2012 to June 2013 he was paid between £20 and £83 a month.
He was not paid between July and September 2013.
Between September and December 2013 he was paid £300 a month.
He was not paid again until April 2015, when he was paid £1,007, followed by £848 for each of the following three months.
The next payment of £2,166 was in June 2017.
There was no subsequent payment until that recorded on the RTI return for April 2020, of £3,192.66  The same payment was recorded for the following two months; this increased to £3,220.80 in July 2020 and continued at that rate until September 2021.
From October 2021 to July 2023 (the last month for which records were provided to us) no payment was made.
On 20 April 2020, on behalf of CMC, Mr Mahmood made a CJRS claim of £5,616.33 for the period from 1 March to 30 April 2020; further claims were made every subsequent month until September 2021.  The total amount claimed was £46,619.48, made up of £45,080 to Mr Mahmood, plus employer NICs and pension contributions.
CMC’s statutory accounts for the year ended 30 June 2019 as filed with Companies House did not show any salary paid to Mr Mahmood, or any amounts owed to him.  That is consistent with the RTI returns for the same period.
The Bundle included an amended version of CMC’s statutory accounts for the year ended 30 June 2020, which gave a figure of £10,278 for “staff costs”.  This is similar to the amount shown as salary for Mr Mahmood from April to June (£10,080), albeit the related NICs and pension payments are absent.  There were no creditors or accruals.  These accounts also showed turnover of £196,200 and current assets of £1,886,077 (figures which Mr Mahmood was unable to explain).  The accounts for the following year to 30 June 2021 did not include a profit and loss account, but stated that there were nil creditors and nil accruals.
On 10 August 2022, Mr Douglas opened a compliance check into CMC.  Mr Mahmood told Mr Douglas that he had based CMC’s CJRS claims on the £40,000 salary to which he was entitled when at Ocean Network, on the basis that this was the amount he “reasonably expected” to earn during lockdown.
After various exchanges of correspondence and a telephone interview, on 10 November 2022, Mr Douglas issued CMC with four assessments totalling £46,619.48 to recover the full amount of the CJRS claims. Mr Mahmood asked for a statutory review; the review officer upheld Mr Douglas’s decision, and Mr Mahmood notified the appeal to the Tribunal.
The legislative structure
Section 76 of the Coronavirus Act 2020 provided that “Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs are to have such functions as the Treasury may direct in relation to coronavirus or coronavirus disease”.  Section 71 of the same Act provided:
“Signatures of Treasury Commissioners
Section 1 of the Treasury Instruments (Signature) Act 1849 (instruments etc required to be signed by the Commissioners of the Treasury) has effect as if the reference to two or more of the Commissioners of Her Majesty’s Treasury were to one or more of the Commissioners.
For the purposes of that reference, a Minister of the Crown in the Treasury who is not a Commissioner of Her Majesty’s Treasury is to be treated as if the Minister were a Commissioner of Her Majesty’s Treasury.”
The law which governed CJRS payments was therefore made by a series of Treasury Directions. The First Direction was issued on 15 April 2020, and provided:
This direction applies to Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs.
This direction requires Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs to be responsible for the payment and management of amounts to be paid under the scheme set out in the Schedule to this direction (the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme).
This direction has effect for the duration of the scheme.”
The substance of the CJRS was set out in the Schedule to the First Direction.  There were six further Directions and related Schedules, until the CJRS ceased at the end of September 2021.
Fixed rate employee?
All the Directions distinguished between two types of employee, those which were “fixed rate” and others, and the wording of the relevant provisions was essentially identical.  Paragraph 7.6(1) of the First Direction read:
“A person is a fixed rate employee if:
the person is an employee, or is  treated as an employee for the purposes of CJRS by virtue of paragraph 35.3(a) (member of a limited liability partnership),
the person is entitled under their contract to be paid an annual salary,
the person is entitled under their contract to be paid that salary in respect of a number of hours in a year whether those hours are specified in or ascertained in accordance with their contract (“the basic hours”),
the person is not entitled under their contract to a payment in respect of the basic hours other than an annual salary,
the person is entitled under their contract to be paid, where practicable and regardless of the number of hours actually worked in a particular week or month in equal weekly, multiple of weeks or monthly instalments, and
the basic hours worked in a salary period do not normally vary according to business, economic or agricultural seasonal considerations.”
In all the Directions, the term “contract” was defined as “a legally enforceable agreement”, and this in turn was expanded to include “a legally enforceable agreement, understanding, scheme, transaction or series of transactions”.
HMRC took the view that Mr Mahmood was a fixed rate employee; Mr Mahmood did not make any submissions as to whether or not this was the case.  However, we find that Mr Mahmood was not a fixed rate employee, because:
the £40,000 salary on which he had based the CJRS claim was the sum he “reasonably expected” to receive; not on any contractual agreement between him and CMC; and
it is also clear from the financial statements no sum was accrued in the periods before or after the CJRS, to reflect any liability of CMC to pay Mr Mahmood salary for those other months.
Mr Mahmood therefore did not have any “legally enforceable agreement, understanding, scheme, transaction or series of transactions” such as to constitute a contractual entitlement to be paid an annual salary of £40,000 by CMC.
The First Direction
Paragraph 3 of the Schedule to the First Direction specified the employers to which it applied: essentially any employer with a PAYE scheme registered on HMRC’s RTI system on 19 March 2020.  It was common ground that CMC met this requirement.
Paragraph 5 was headed “Qualifying costs”, and read:
“The costs of employment in respect of which an employer may make a claim for payment under CJRS are costs which –
relate to an employee –
to whom the employer made a payment of earnings in the tax year 2019-20 which is shown in a return under Schedule A1 to the PAYE Regulations that is made on or before a day that is a relevant CJRS day,
in relation to whom the employer has not reported a date of cessation of employment on or before that date, and
who is a furloughed employee (see paragraph 6), and
meets the relevant conditions in paragraphs 7.1 to 7.15 in relation to the furloughed employee.”
Paragraph 13.1 defined “relevant CJRS day” as follows:
“For the purposes of CJRS –
a day is a relevant CJRS day if that day is –
28 February 2020, or
19 March 2020.”
It was also common ground that CMC satisfied paragraphs 5(a)(ii) and (iii) and 5(b). With regard to paragraph 5(a)(i), there was no dispute that CMC had not made a payment of earnings in the tax year 2019-20.
HMRC’s position was that CMC was not entitled to CJRS because it had not made a payment of earnings in the tax year 2019-20 which was shown in an RTI return (being a “return under Schedule A1 to the PAYE Regulations”) which had been made on or before either of the two relevant CJRS days.
Although Mr Mahmood accepted that CMC did not meet the conditions in paragraph 5, he relied on paragraph 8(1).  This was headed “Expenditure to be reimbursed” and read (his emphasis):
“Subject as follows, on a claim by an employer for a payment under CJRS, the payment may reimburse-
the gross amount of earnings paid or reasonably expected to be paid by the employer to an employee;
any employer national insurance contributions liable to be paid by the employer arising from the payment of the gross amount;
the amount allowable as a CJRS claimable pension contribution.”
Mr Mahmood submitted that the words “reasonably expected to be paid” allowed CMC to make a claim for the amount of money which he reasonably expected to be paid on a monthly basis, given his previous employment by Ocean Network.
We disagree. As Mr McCabe said, it is paragraph 5 which sets out “The costs of employment in respect of which an employer may make a claim for payment”, in other words, this is the paragraph which prescribes  gateway conditions for a CJRS claim to be made.
The purpose of paragraph 8 is to set out the money to be reimbursed to employers who have already met the gateway conditions in the Direction.  This can be can be seen from the following (our emphasis):
Paragraph 5 begins “The costs of employment in respect of which an employer may make a claim for payment under CJRS” are those defined in that section.  The conditions in that paragraph therefore have to be met for an valid claim to be made.
Paragraph 8 begins “…on a claim by an employer for a payment under CJRS, the payment may reimburse”.  This paragraph therefore set out the amount which can be claimed once the conditions in paragraph 5 have been met.
Conclusion as to entitlement to CJRS under the First Direction?
Paragraph 5 set out gateway conditions, and provided that an employer can only make a CJRS claim if it:
made a payment of earnings to the employee in the tax year 2019-20; and
reported that payment on an RTI return which was made on or before 28 February or 19 March 2020; and
met the other conditions referred to or set out in paragraph 5.
CMC did not make any payment of earnings to Mr Mahmood in 2019-20, and the RTI returns for that tax year give a £nil figure for each month.  As a result, CMC was not entitled to make a CJRS claim under the First Direction.
The Second to Fourth Directions
The Second Direction extended the duration of CJRS from 1 June to 30 June 2020, and so covered earnings of furloughed employees in respect of that period.
Paragraph 5 of the Schedule to the Second Direction defines “Qualifying costs” in identical terms to the First Direction.  The same definition of “relevant CJRS day” was included at paragraph 13.1, and the extracts above from paragraph 8 of the First Direction are repeated in the Second Direction.
The Third and Fourth Directions made a number of changes to the CJRS, including the introduction of the concept of “flexible furlough”, but the provisions discussed above were replicated without any change.
It therefore follows that CMC was also not entitled to claim CJRS in respect of Mr Mahmood for the periods covered by these three further Directions
The Fifth Direction
The Fifth Direction applied to claims made from 1 November 2020 to 31 March 2021, and opened the CJRS to some further employers/employees.  We considered whether this change assisted CMC in relation to Mr Mahmood.
Paragraph 6.2 provided that an employee qualified for CJRS if the employer had made a payment to that employee which was included on an RTI return delivered to HMRC between 19 March 2020 and 31 October 2020.  Mr Mahmood was included on the RTI returns delivered to HMRC from 20 April 2020 through to 20 October 2020, and was thus a qualifying employee.
Paragraph 9 was headed “qualifying costs” and set out a complicated formula applying to  employees who are flexibly furloughed.  Paragraph 10 applied to employees, such as Mr Mahmood, who were not in that position but instead did no work.  The paragraph provides that the amount of CJRS which may be claimed per month was the lower of:
£2,500; and
80% of the employee’s “reference salary”.
The “reference salary” is therefore key to the amount of CJRS which can be claimed. The provisions are complex and interlinked, as explained below.
Reference salary
Paragraph 12.1 sets out how the reference salary is determined: it read:
“The reference salary of an employee must be determined in accordance with-
paragraphs 13.1 to 13.8 and 15.1 to 15.7 if the employee is a fixed rate employee, and
paragraphs 14.1 and 14.2 and 15.1 to 15.7 if the employee is not a fixed rate employee.”
Subparagraph (a) refers to paragraph 13.1, which defines a fixed rate employee in essentially the same terms as already discussed at §25ff; paragraph 13.2 then reads:
“The reference salary of a fixed rate employee is the amount payable to the employee in the latest salary period ending on or before the employee’s relevant reference day…”
Subparagraph (b) refers to paragraph 14.2, which similarly states that their reference salary depends on the “reference day”.
Thus, before Mr Mahmood’s “reference salary” can be established, we need to determine his “reference day”.
The reference day
Paragraph 11.2 read:
“The relevant reference day in relation to an employee to whom paragraph 11.3 or paragraph 11.5 applies is 19 March 2020”
Paragraph 11.8 read:
“The relevant reference day in relation to an employee to whom neither paragraph 11.3 nor paragraph 11.5 applies is 30 October 2020.”
Thus, if either paragraph 11.3 or paragraph 11.5 applied to Mr Mahmood, his reference day was 19 March 2020.  If neither applied, his reference day was 30 October 2020.
Paragraph 11.5
HMRC said at [73] of their skeleton (emphasis added):
“The Fifth Direction applied to claims between 1 November 2020 and 31 January 2021. At paragraph 11 this sets out how to determine the employees’ ‘relevant reference day’ for determining their reference salary. The Respondents submit that the employees’ reference day is 19 March 2020, pursuant to para 11.2 as paragraph 11.5 applies.”
HMRC therefore relied on paragraph 11.5 as the basis for their submission that Mr Mahmood’s reference day was 19 March 2020, and we first discuss that subparagraph.  It  read:
“This paragraph applies to an employee if the employee’s employer-
has made a CJRS claim in relation to the employee by virtue of a relevant provision…”
The meaning of “relevant provision” was given by paragraph 11.6:
“The following are relevant provisions for the purposes of paragraph 11.5(a)-
paragraphs 9.1 to 11.3 of the first CJRS direction;
paragraphs 9.1 to 11.3 of the second CJRS direction;
paragraphs 37.1 to 39.3 of the third CJRS direction.”
In order to understand paragraph 11.5, it is therefore necessary to look back at those earlier provisions.
Paragraphs 9.1 to 11.3 of the First and Second Directions related to:
employers that have no qualifying PAYE scheme;
successions to a business, where the new employer has a qualifying PAYE scheme; and
PAYE scheme reorganisations.
Paragraphs 37.1 to 39.3 of the Third CJRS Direction were identical to the above, other than that they added further provisions which applied where there was a succession to a business, but where the new employer was not a qualifying employer.
Thus, paragraph 11.5 only applied where one of the “relevant provisions” was satisfied.  None of the provisions applied to CMC. We therefore disagree with HMRC that Mr Mahmood’s “relevant reference day” was 19 March 2020 as the result of paragraph 11.5.
Paragraph 11.3
However, the “relevant reference day” was also 19 March 2020 if paragraph 11.3 applied.  This read:
“This paragraph applies to an employee if-
the employer making the CJRS claim made a payment (“the payment”) to the employee,
the payment was reported to HMRC pursuant to paragraph 22 of Schedule A1 to the PAYE Regulations in a return that the employer is required to deliver in accordance with regulations 67B or 67D of those Regulations, and
the return mentioned in paragraph 11.3(b) was delivered to HMRC on or before 19 March 2020.”
CMC did make payments to Mr Mahmood and record them on RTI returns delivered to HMRC before 19 March 2020, see §16.  For example, he was paid £2,166 in June 2017 and that sum was included on an RTI return.
We therefore agree with HMRC that Mr Mahmood’s “reference day” was 19 March 2020, albeit for a different reason from that given in their skeleton.
Mr Mahmood’s reference salary
Having established Mr Mahmood’s reference day, it is now possible to determine his reference salary.
As already noted, the method of calculating the reference salary depended on whether the employee was a fixed rate employee or not.  Since Mr Mahmood was not a fixed rate employee, his reference salary was determined by paragraph 14.2, which read:
“The reference salary of an employee…whose relevant reference day is 19 March 2020 is the greater of-
the average monthly (or daily or other appropriate pro-rata) amount payable to the employee in the period comprising the tax year 2019-20 (or, if less, the period of employment) before the period covered by a CJRS claim began, and
the amount earned by the employee in the corresponding calendar period in the previous year.”
Mr Mahmood received no earnings from CMC in either 2019-20 or in 2018-19, and as a result his reference salary was nil.
For completeness, we add that the position would have been the same had Mr Mahmood been a fixed rate employee.  The reference salary for such employees was given by paragraph 13.2, which read:
“The reference salary of a fixed rate employee is the amount payable to the employee in the latest salary period ending on or before the employee’s relevant reference day.”
CMC submitted an RTI return for the March 2020 salary period, which showed that £nil was paid to Mr Mahmood.  Had Mr Mahmood been a fixed rate employee, his reference salary on the reference day of 31 March 2020 would also have been nil.
The CJRS payable for Mr Mahmood
As set out at §45, paragraph 10 provided that the amount of CJRS which could be claimed per month was the lower of:
£2,500; and
80% of the employee’s “reference salary”.
Since Mr Mahmood’s reference salary was nil, the maximum which could be paid to him under CJRS was also nil.  CMC was therefore not entitled to claim any amount of CJRS for Mr Mahmood under the Fifth Direction.
The Sixth and Seventh Directions
The Sixth Direction was issued on 25 January 2021 and extended the CJRS to 30 April 2021.  Paragraph 5 modified paragraph 14.2 of the Fifth Direction for non-fixed rate employees; it stated that the reference salary was that in the “corresponding calendar period occurring in 2019”.  As Mr Mahmood had no salary in any calendar period during 2019, this new provision does not assist CMC.
The Seventh Direction extended the CJRS to 30 September 2021.  The wording of the provisions establishing the “relevant reference day” was amended by paragraph 11 to categorise employees as “Group 1” (with a relevant reference day of 19 March 2020); “Group 2” (with a relevant reference day of 30 October 2020) and “Group 3” (with a relevant reference day of 2 March 2021).
Paragraph 12 set out the meaning of a “Group 1” employee:
An employee is a Group 1 employee if a Group 1 payment has been made to the employee by a person who is a relevant employer.
A payment is a Group 1 payment if-
the payment was reported to HMRC pursuant to paragraph 22 of Schedule A1 to the PAYE Regulations in a return that the relevant employer is required to deliver in accordance with regulations 67B or 67D of those Regulations, and
the return mentioned in paragraph 12.2(a) was delivered to HMRC on or before 19 March 2020, and
the payment is not an excluded payment (Footnote: 1).”
This is similar to paragraph 11.3 of the Fifth Direction.  As CMC had  made payments to Mr Mahmood which were recorded on RTI returns delivered to HMRC before 19 March 2020, he was a Group 1 employee.
A person who was within the definition of a Group 1 employee could not be a Group 2 or Group 3 employee.  This is clear from paragraphs 13.1 and 15.1, which say that a person is only a Group 2 employee if he is not a Group 1 employee, and he is only a Group 3 employee if he neither a Group 1 nor Group 2 employee.
Since Mr Mahmood is within Group 1, his reference day remained 19 March 2020, and CMC continued not to be entitled to claim CJRS.
Clawback provisions
Paragraph 8 of Schedule 16 to the Finance Act 2020 is headed “Charge if person not entitled to coronavirus support payment” and so far as relevant provides:
A recipient of an amount of a coronavirus support payment is liable to income tax under this paragraph if the recipient is not entitled to the amount in accordance with the scheme under which the payment was made.
…
The amount of income tax chargeable under this paragraph is the amount equal to so much of the coronavirus support payment
as the recipient is not entitled to, and
as has not been repaid to the person who made the coronavirus support payment.”
Paragraph 9 is headed “Assessments of income tax chargeable under paragraph 8” and so far as relevant reads:
If an officer of Revenue and Customs considers (whether on the basis of information or documents obtained by virtue of the exercise of powers under Schedule 36 to FA 2008 or otherwise) that a person has received an amount of a coronavirus support payment to which the person is not entitled, the officer may make an assessment in the amount which ought in the officer's opinion to be charged under paragraph 8.
An assessment under sub-paragraph (1) may be made at any time, but this is subject to sections 34 and 36 of TMA 1970.
Parts 4 to 6 of TMA 1970 contain other provisions that are relevant to an assessment under sub-paragraph (1) (for example, section 31 makes provision about appeals and section 59B(6) makes provision about the time to pay income tax payable by virtue of an assessment).”
There was no dispute that if CMC were not entitled to claim CJRS for Mr Mahmood, as we have found to be the position, then HMRC were entitled under the above provisions to reclaim the full amount by making income tax assessments.

GLOBAL BY NATURE LIMITED
Appellant
and
THE COMMISSIONERS FOR
HIS MAJESTY’S REVENUE AND CUSTOMS
Respondents
Representation:
For the Appellant: Max Schofield of Counsel, instructed by Grant Thornton LLP
For the Respondents:  Edward Hellier of Counsel, instructed by the General Counsel and Solicitor to HM Revenue and Customs
DECISION
Introduction
The appellant, Global by Nature Ltd (“GBN”), imports, distributes and sells organic products in the UK. These include powdered vegan food supplements under the brands “Sunwarrior” and “Hemple”.
On 16 February 2021, Grant Thornton LLP (“Grant Thornton”) filed an Error Correction Notification (“ECN”) on behalf of GBN, requesting a repayment of output tax overdeclared between 1 October 2016 and 30 September 2020 totalling £1,246,566.08, on the basis that certain products, including those sold under the Sunwarrior and Hemple brands, were properly zero-rated as food.
On 20 October 2021, Officer Richard Shortland issued a decision letter rejecting the ECN in relation several of the products.  On 20 April 2022, Grant Thornton submitted a revised ECN relating only to the Sunwarrior and Hemple products, totalling £809,739.  On 1 August 2022, Officer Shortland agreed that the Hemple products were zero-rated, but held that the Sunwarrior products were “sports drinks” and therefore standard rated under excepted Item 4A at Group 1 of Schedule 8 to the Value Added Taxes Act 1994 (“VATA”).  This reads:
“Sports drinks that are advertised or marketed as products designed to enhance physical performance, accelerate recovery after exercise or build bulk, and other similar drinks, including (in either case) syrups, concentrates, essences, powders, crystals or other products for the preparation of such drinks.”
Officer Shortland’s decision was upheld on statutory review, and on 17 March 2023, GBN appealed to the Tribunal. The Notice of Appeal said that the VAT in dispute was £798,855.87 (HMRC’s Statement of Case continues to refer to a figure of £809,739, but this appears to be an error).
There were three Sunwarrior products in issue (together, “the Products”):
Sunwarrior Classic Protein (“Classic”);
Sunwarrior Protein Classic Plus (“Plus”); and
Sunwarrior Protein Warrior Blend (“Warrior”).
Although there have been many appeals before courts and tribunals about the VAT status of various foodstuffs, this was the first which turned on the meaning and effect of Item 4A. We were therefore particularly grateful for the helpful submissions of Mr Schofield, who represented GBN, and Mr Hellier, who represented HMRC.
Having considered the law, the evidence and the parties’ submissions, we decided that the Products did not come within Item 4A for the following reasons:
Item 4A applied to certain “sports drinks”.
The term “sports drinks” refers to drinks which contain a significant quantity of carbohydrate, together with salts (such as sodium and potassium), designed to replenish the body after exercise.
The Products contained a maximum of 5% carbohydrate and were therefore not sports drinks.
We also considered the alternative approach to the statutory interpretation of Item 4A put forward by HMRC.  Having done so, we decided that even on that alternative reading, Classic and Plus would be zero-rated, although Warrior would be standard rated.
The Evidence
The Tribunal was provided with a Bundle of documents which ran to 628 pages, including a witness statement from Mr Andrew Lee, who at all relevant times was GBN’s Finance Director.  He was cross-examined by Mr Hellier and re-examined by Mr Schofield.  We found him to be an entirely credible and honest witness.
Attached to his witness statement were over 250 pages of evidence, including pictures of the Products, pictures of other products, marketing material and downloads from various webpages.  He also exhibited a copy of Grant Thornton’s letter attaching the revised ECN, which included further pictures and other material. Mr Hellier did not submit that any of this embedded material should not be accepted as evidence, and we admitted it.  Grant Thornton’s letter also included stills from two videos. As HMRC had been provided with links to those videos, and as Mr Hellier did not submit that the stills were unrepresentative, we admitted those too.
Further marketing material and related evidence were incorporated in Officer Shortland’s detailed decision letter of 20 October 2021; Mr Schofield did not submit that this embedded material should not be accepted as evidence, and we admitted it.  However, we have not relied on some of the extracts and citations in that letter for one or both of the following reasons:
we were unable to establish their source, for example whether they were from (a) the Sunwarrior or GBN websites or (b) from a third party website over which neither Sunwarrior nor GBN had control; and/or
it was unclear to which of the Products the extract or citation related.
Various marketing materials and other evidence in the Bundle had been downloaded or were otherwise dated after the relevant period, but neither party submitted that any of that evidence did not accurately reflect the position during that period, and we have taken that to be the position.
The Statute
VATA s 30 provides for the zero-rating of goods “of a description... specified in Schedule 8”.  Group 1 of Sch 8 is headed “Food”, which is defined as follows:
“The supply of anything comprised in the general items set out below, except—
a supply in the course of catering; and
a supply of anything comprised in any of the excepted items set out below, unless it is also comprised in any of the items overriding the exceptions set out below which relates to that excepted item.”
Note (1) to Schedule 8 provides that “‘Food’ includes drink”.  It was common ground that the Products were food.  As set out at the beginning of this decision, excepted Item 4A reads:
“Sports drinks that are advertised or marketed as products designed to enhance physical performance, accelerate recovery after exercise or build bulk, and other similar drinks, including (in either case) syrups, concentrates, essences, powders, crystals or other products for the preparation of such drinks.”
Item 4A was introduced by FA 2012 s 196, Sch 26, paras 1 and 2 with effect from 1 October 2012.  We discuss the reasons for its introduction later in our decision, see §35ff below.
Authorities on the principles of statutory interpretation
In R (Project for the Registration of Children as British Citizens) v SSHD [2022] UKSC 3 (“PRCBC”), Lord Hodge, giving the leading judgment with which all members of the Court agreed, summarised the process of statutory interpretation as follows:
“[29] The courts in conducting statutory interpretation are “seeking the meaning of the words which Parliament used”: Black-Clawson International Ltd v Papierwerke Waldhof-Aschaffenburg AG [1975] AC 591, 613 per Lord Reid of Drem. More recently, Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead stated:
“Statutory interpretation is an exercise which requires the court to identify the meaning borne by the words in question in the particular context.”
(R v Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions, Ex p Spath Holme Ltd [2001] AC 349, 396). Words and passages in a statute derive their meaning from their context. A phrase or passage must be read in the context of the section as a whole and in the wider context of a relevant group of sections. Other provisions in a statute and the statute as a whole may provide the relevant context. They are the words which Parliament has chosen to enact as an expression of the purpose of the legislation and are therefore the primary source by which meaning is ascertained.
There is an important constitutional reason for having regard primarily to the statutory context as Lord Nicholls explained in Spath Holme, 397:
“Citizens, with the assistance of their advisers, are intended to be able to understand parliamentary enactments, so that they can regulate their conduct accordingly. They should be able to rely upon what they read in an Act of Parliament.”
[30] External aids to interpretation therefore must play a secondary role. Explanatory notes, prepared under the authority of Parliament, may cast light on the meaning of particular statutory provisions. Other sources, such as Law Commission reports, reports of Royal Commissions and advisory committees, and Government White Papers may disclose the background to a statute and assist the court to identify not only the mischief which it addresses but also the purpose of the legislation, thereby assisting a purposive interpretation of a particular statutory provision. The context disclosed by such materials is relevant to assist the court to ascertain the meaning of the statute, whether or not there is ambiguity and uncertainty, and indeed may reveal ambiguity or uncertainty: Bennion, Bailey and Norbury on Statutory Interpretation, 8th ed (2020), para 11.2. But none of these external aids displace the meanings conveyed by the words of a statute that, after consideration of that context, are clear and unambiguous and which do not produce absurdity…”
In Centrica Overseas Holdings v HMRC [2024] UKSC 25 (“Centrica”) at [48], Lady Simler, giving the only judgment with which other members of the Court agreed, endorsed that approach, and continued at [49]:
“As Lord Bingham explained in Quintavalle (Footnote: 1), legislation is usually enacted tomake some change, or address some problem, and the court’s task, within thepermissible bounds of interpretation, is to give effect to that purpose (see para 8). He also approved as authoritative that part of the dissenting speech of Lord Wilberforce in Royal College of Nursing of the United Kingdom v Department of Health and Social Security [1981] AC 800 at 822, where Lord Wilberforce said:
‘In interpreting an Act of Parliament it is proper, and indeed necessary, to have regard to the state of affairs existing, and known by Parliament to be existing, at the time. It is a fair presumption that Parliament’s policy or intention is directed to that state of affairs’.”
STATUTORY INTERPRETATION
We first consider the meaning of the words as used in Item 4A, and then the pre-enacting history.
The meaning of the words
As is clear from PRCBC, in order to establish which products come within Item 4A, we must determine “the meaning of the words which Parliament used”.
HMRC’s position
HMRC’s position, as set out in their Statement of Case, was that:
“Item 4A…states that food supplies will be considered to be sports or similar  drinks due to the way that they have been advertised and marketed. In this respect, the Respondents contend that it is not the primary function of the Sunwarrior Protein Powder Products that determines their VAT rating, but the way they have been advertised and marketed.”
This reflected Officer Shortland’s position: he said:
“HMRC’s opinion is these products are advertised or marketed as products designed to enhance physical performance, accelerate recovery after exercise or build bulk or a similar drink falling within Excepted Item 4A”
HMRC’s review letter upheld Officer Shortland’s decision on the basis that “excepted item 4A does not rely on the primary function but rather how the product is advertised and marketed”.
Mr Hellier submitted that Item 4A had to be read as a whole, or, as he put it, “articulated”, so that a product would fall within the exception if it was:
a “drink” which was “advertised or marketed” as “designed” to do one or more of the following, in a sports context:
enhance physical performance;
accelerate recovery after exercise; and/or
build bulk;
or was a “similar drink” to one which fell within the above statutory description.
HMRC’s position was therefore that the term “sports drinks” was defined by the second part of the statutory phrase, so that all drinks advertised or marketed as designed to enhance physical performance, accelerate recovery after exercise or build bulk were “sports drinks” as long as there was a reference in the advertising and marketing to “sports”.
GBN’s position
Mr Schofield submitted that a product would only fall within Item 4A if it was:
a “sports drink”
which was “advertised or marketed” as “designed to enhance physical performance, accelerate recovery after exercise or build bulk”; or
was a “similar drink”.
In other words, Item 4A encompassed only certain sports drinks, namely those which were advertised or marketed in the way prescribed (or drinks which were similar to those types of sports drinks). This was, he said, clear from the words of the statute which read (his emphasis):
“Sports drinks that are advertised or marketed as products designed to enhance physical performance, accelerate recovery after exercise or build bulk…”
It was therefore first necessary to establish whether a product was a “sports drink”, and if it was, the second stage was to decide whether it was advertised or marketed in the way set out in the remainder of the statutory provision.  If the product was not a “sports drink”, there was no need to consider the remaining words of the exception.
Mr Schofield emphasised that HMRC’s reading of the provision ignored the context and weight to be given to the word “sports”.  If HMRC were to be correct, Item 4A would have same meaning if the word “sports” were absent, so the provision would then read:
“Drinks that are advertised or marketed as products designed to enhance physical performance, accelerate recovery after exercise or build bulk…”
He submitted that HMRC’s  reading therefore conflicted with the statutory presumption that every word in an enactment is to be given meaning, see Bennion, Bailey and Norbury on Statutory Interpretation at 21.2:
“Given the presumption that the legislature does nothing in vain, the court must endeavour to give significance to every word of an enactment. It is presumed that if a word or phrase appears, it was put there for a purpose and must not be disregarded.”
Discussion
We agree with Mr Schofield that Item 4A does not set out a definition of a “sports drink”.  Had the statutory phrase been definitional it might have been drafted as follows:
“Sports drinks, being drinks that are advertised or marketed as products designed to enhance physical performance, accelerate recovery after exercise or build bulk.”
Or possibly as:
“Sports drinks, namely drinks that are advertised or marketed as products designed to enhance physical performance, accelerate recovery after exercise or build bulk…
However, the Parliamentary draftsman did not use either form of words, or any similar phraseology.  We also agree with Mr Schofield that HMRC’s construction essentially ignores the word “sports”, and that cannot be correct: Item 4A excludes “sports drinks”, not “drinks which have the following characteristics”.
Further support for what we have called Mr Schofield’s two stage test comes from the inclusion in Item 4A of “other similar drinks”.  Assuming his reading is correct, a “similar drink” is one which is both (a) a “sports drink”, and (b) similar to other products which are “advertised or marketed as products designed to enhance physical performance [etc]”. The two stage test therefore gives a straightforward and comprehensible meaning to the term “similar drinks”.
However, were HMRC to be correct that “sports drinks” are drinks “advertised or marketed as products designed to enhance physical performance [etc]”, it is difficult to understand what is meant by “other similar drinks”.  If a “sports drink” is defined by reference to its marketing, how can a product which is not so marketed be “similar” to a “sports drink”?  We asked this question during the hearing but did not obtain a satisfactory response.
The pre-enacting history and external aids
Further support for Mr Schofield’s reading comes from the pre-enacting history, including by reference to admissible external aids, see Centrica and PRCBC cited above.
The original legislative position
The starting point is Items 3 and 4 of Group 1: both of these provisions have been included in the statute since the introduction of VAT:
Beverages chargeable with any duty of excise specifically charged on spirits, beer, wine or made-wine  and preparations thereof.
Other beverages (Footnote: 2) (including fruit juices and bottled waters) and syrups, concentrates, essences, powders, crystals or other products for the preparation of beverages.”
Case law and guidance
In Bioconcepts Ltd v C & E Comrs [1993] VAT Decision 11287 (“Bioconcepts”), the VAT Tribunal held that a dietary supplement called Bio-Light was not a “beverage”, because a “beverage” was a drink which was consumed “to increase bodily liquid levels, to slake the thirst, to fortify or to give pleasure”.
HMRC did not appeal Bioconcepts, and in 1994 issued guidance that most sports and athletics drinks were zero-rated because they were aimed at heightening athletic  performance.
A subsequent VAT Tribunal found that a Ribena drink with added fibre was a “beverage” because it “could be drunk for pleasure…consumed to increase bodily fluids and to slake the thirst”, see SmithKline Beecham plc v C & E Comrs [1995] VAT Decision 13674.
Following concerns in the industry about distortion of competition, in 1997 HMRC, issued new guidance stating that sports drinks were closer to “Ribena juice and fibre” than to “Bio‑Light” and so should be standard‑rated.  The guidance said:
“This is a growing market, with new types of products emerging aimed at the specific needs of those participating in different types of sports and athletics. These range from drinks aimed at replacing liquids lost during exercise, carbohydrate-rich powders designed to heighten athletic performance and protein powders for body builders who want to increase muscle mass or those who want to gain weight.”
The next relevant case was SiS v C&E Comrs [2000] VAT Decision 16555, which concerned supplements high in carbohydrates and/or creatin, a type of protein. The products were consumed before or after intense physical exercise “by the athletes, sportspersons and others who characteristically take them for nutritional purposes”.  The Tribunal held that the products were not beverages, and observed:
“[Customs’] policy is flawed in failing to distinguish between ‘sports drinks’ that are in reality drinks, and ‘dietary integrators’ which happen to be made up as drinks. In our judgment, the latter will seldom if ever amount to beverages or products for the preparation of beverages.”
Budget 2012 and related consultation
In Budget 2012, the Government announced that it was going to introduce secondary legislation “to address long-standing VAT anomalies and loopholes”, including ensuring that “VAT will also apply, to the extent that it does not already do so, to…sports drinks”.
On the same day, 21 March 2012, HMRC issued a consultation document entitled “VAT: Addressing borderline anomalies” (“the Consultation”). This said that one of the measures being considered was to “tax sports nutrition drinks at the standard rate to ensure that all sports drinks receive the same tax treatment whether or not they are consumed for nutritional purposes”.  The Consultation asked:
“Does the proposed legislation meet its objective of ensuring that sports nutrition drinks are taxed consistently with other sports drinks at the standard rate of VAT? If not, why not and what changes are needed?”
Under the heading “why do the current rules need changing”, the Consultation said:
“Despite their similarity to other standard-rated beverages, the courts have found some sports drinks not to be beverages because of their nutritional content and therefore zero-rated. This change ensures that all sports drinks are taxed in a similar way, ensuring that there is consistent treatment of sports drinks whether consumed for rehydration or nutritional purposes.”
Under the heading “what is the scope of the change”, the text said:
“The change will only affect ‘sports nutrition’ drinks that are currently treated as zero-rated and ensures that all sports drinks receive the same tax treatment (‘sports energy drinks’ for example are already standard– rated as beverages). The products affected exist pre-mixed in liquid form and also in powder form to be made up into a liquid by the consumer.
They are often marketed as supplying energy to enhance performance, accelerating recovery after exercise, providing energy, or building bulk and often contain creatine.
Examples of products affected by the change include: sports nutrition drinks such as carbohydrate drinks, protein drinks, creatine drinks, work-out recovery products, whether or not in powder form.
Examples of products not affected by the change include: meal replacement drinks for slimmers and invalids.”
The Explanatory Notes and the VAT Manual
Item 4A was introduced into VATA by FA 2012, Sch 1. The relevant Explanatory Note said that the change had been made “to make it clear that certain sports drinks (as specified) are not included within the VAT zero rate”. Within the Explanatory Note, the Background Note explained:
“A number of anomalies have arisen along the borderlines of the VAT exemptions and the VAT zero rates, leading to loss of revenue, uncertainty for business and costs for HMRC.
In his Budget Statement of 21 March 2012, the Chancellor announced a  number of changes to address some of these anomalies. This Schedule gives effect to those changes, taking into account responses received to an HMRC consultation on the draft legislation.”
HMRC’s VAT Food Manual at VFOOD7590 says that the final phrase “and other similar drinks” was included in the legislation following concerns that “some suppliers of sports nutrition drinks might change their advertising or marketing campaigns to gain an unfair advantage”.  Although the Manuals normally “set out HMRC’s view of the law rather than principles of law that are binding either on HMRC or the Tribunal”, see Flix v HMRC [2015] UKFTT 0558 (TC) at [61], endorsed in Flix v HMRC [2016] UKUT 301 (TCC) at [50], this passage does not have that purpose.  Instead, it provides factual information about the drafting of Item 4A, a provision which was formulated “taking into account responses received to an HMRC consultation on the draft legislation”, see the Explanatory Notes cited at §46 above.  It  can therefore be regarded as an external aid which helps to identify the mischief to which this part of Item 4A was directed.
Discussion
Mr Schofield submitted that the Red Book, the Consultation and the Explanatory Notes make it clear that Item 4A was not drafted in order to introduce a statutory definition of  “sports drinks”, but instead to cover “certain” sports drinks, namely those which were not already standard rated as beverages.
We agree: this can be seen from the following (our emphases):
The Consultation identified the mischief as being that “the courts had found some sports drinks not to be beverages because of their nutritional content”.
To remedy that mischief the law was changed so that:
“sports nutrition drinks are taxed consistently with other sports drinks at the standard rate of VAT” (the Consultation);
“all sports drinks receive the same tax treatment whether or not they are consumed for nutritional purposes” (the Consultation); and
“to make it clear that certain sports drinks (as specified) are not included within the VAT zero rate” (the Explanatory Notes).
Item 4A was thus aimed at those “sports drinks” which had hitherto been zero-rated to bring them into line with sports drinks which were already standard rated as beverages.
Further support can be found in the explanation given in VFOOD7590 for the words “other similar drinks”.  This explains that the words “other similar drinks” were included because sports drinks which had been “designed to enhance physical performance, accelerate recovery after exercise or build bulk” would otherwise be able to retain zero-rating providing they were not advertised or marketed as such.  That explanation cannot be reconciled with HMRC’s position that a sports drink is one which is defined by its advertising and marketing.  It is instead consistent with Mr Schofield’s reading of the provision, namely that a “similar drink” is both (a) a “sports drink”, and (b) similar to other products which are “advertised or marketed as products designed to enhance physical performance [etc]”.
What is a “sports drink”
Since a product must be a “sports drink” to fall within Item 4A, the next question is “what is a ‘sports drink’?  There is no definition in the legislation, and we considered the ordinary usage.  GBN put forward numerous dictionary definitions of the term, including the following:
“a drink that consists mainly of water, electrolytes (such as sodium or potassium), and carbohydrates (such as sucrose or fructose) and that is designed to replenish those substances in the body during or after usually strenuous exercise” (Merriam-Webster);
“a type of cold drink that contains sugar and other ingredients that help you to get back energy lost through exercise” (Oxford Learners Dictionaries); and
“a soft drink containing electrolytes such as sodium, potassium, and chloride, and a high percentage of sugar, designed to restore energy during or after sporting activity or strenuous exercise” (Oxford Languages Dictionary, used by Google).
“a drink containing sugar and salts, etc designed to help replace fluid and energy lost through the physical exertion of sport” (Collins); the following example of usage is cited:
“Sports drinks such as Gatorade or Powerade should generally be avoided in favor of water unless you're doing an intense workout. That's because some sports drinks contain more than 30 grams of added sugar…and you may not need its carb- and electrolyte-heavy fuel if you're just going for a 45-minute easy ride”.
Mr Hellier did not submit that those definitions were incorrect, or put forward any alternatives. GBN also relied on the following examples of usage, none of which was challenged by Mr Hellier:
“sports drinks are designed to supplement the body's daily carbohydrate intake, and contain high levels of carbohydrate in order to provide maximum energy uptake…[they are] functional drinks specifically designed to help athletes and other active people hydrate before, during and after exercise” (British Soft Drinks Association (“BSDA”).
“Sports drinks are marketed as beverages that: replenish electrolytes lost during exercise, supply carbohydrates, prevent dehydration and sustain endurance capacity” (Canadian Paediatric Society Position Statement published in Paediatrics & Child Health, published by the Oxford University Press in 2017).
“Sports drinks typically contain carbohydrates from sugar sources …carbohydrate content in the range of 5gm to 14g per 240ml/8oz serving is reported” (ibid).
All of these definitions and usages refer to “sports drinks” as containing carbohydrates. together with salts (such as sodium and potassium) which provide electrolytes.  The BSDA says that the level of carbohydrate is “significant”, and the Oxford Languages Dictionary that they contain a “high percentage” of carbohydrates. Merriam-Webster defines sports drinks as consisting “mainly” of three ingredients, one of which is carbohydrate, and the example cited  refers to “carb- and electrolyte-heavy fuel”.  The Oxford Learners Dictionary and Collins both defines sports drinks by reference to their sugar and salt content.
Taking into account all of the above, we find that “sports drinks” contain a significant amount of carbohydrate (usually sugar).  What is significant can be inferred from the Canadian Paediatric Society Position Statement, which referred to sports drinks as containing between 5gm and 14g of carbohydrate per serving (Footnote: 3).
We were not provided with any evidence as to the level of salts within a “sports drink” and make no related finding.
Protein drinks?
It was not part of HMRC’s case (even in the alternative) that a protein powder consumed by being mixed with water and drunk was a “sports drink”, and Mr Hellier did not make any submission to that effect.
Mr Hellier’s approach was also consistent with HMRC’s guidance in VFOOD2020, which says that HMRC’s policy department accepts (our emphasis):
“…that powdered food supplements can be zero-rated if the product:-has a nutritional content; and/or provides a significant dietary requirement (such as recommended daily fibre); and is consumed in a manner commonly associated with food, for example, it is mixed in with other foods as an ingredient…or it is mixed with water and drunk (as in the Arthrovite case); and is not otherwise standard-rated (that is, as a preparation for making a  beverage).”
The case referenced in that guidance is Arthro Vite v C&E Commrs [1997] VAT Decision 14836 (“Arthro Vite”), which concerned protein powders consumed as a drink. The VAT Tribunal decided they were zero-rated because they had a high nutritional value.
The documents in the Bundle show that HMRC’s position on protein powders is consistent with other usage: the NHS describes them as “protein powders, available as shakes”, not as “sports drinks”; Medical News Today used the terms “protein powders” and “protein shakes”, while the British Nutrition Foundation said that “many protein products exist on the market such as protein shakes, bars, balls and powders”.  The dictionary definitions of “protein shake” were consistent with the usage in the documents provided to us:
“A drink made by mixing protein powder (a powder containing a substance that makes the body grown and be strong) with milk or water” (Cambridge dictionary).
“A blended drink resembling a milkshake that contains high levels of protein,  typically drunk to help someone gain muscle or weight or increase their level of energy. (Oxford Languages Dictionary).
“A beverage containing protein mixed with milk or water for the purposes of improved nutrition” (Wiktionary).
“​A drink that looks like a milkshake and contains a lot of protein” (Oxford Learners Dictionaries).
Meaning of “sports drink”
For the reasons given above, we find that the ordinary meaning of the term “sports drinks” is a drink which contains a significant quantity of carbohydrate, usually sugar, together with salts (such as sodium and potassium) which provide electrolytes. That is a finding of fact, see Brutus v Cozens [1973] AC 854, where Lord Reid stated at 861D-E:
“The meaning of an ordinary word of the English language is not a question of law. The proper construction of a statute is a question of law. If the context shows that a word is used in an unusual sense the court will determine in other words what that unusual sense is.”
Neither party submitted that the term “sports drinks” was used in an “unusual sense” in Item 4A.  However, we noted that the Consultation had said that the proposed legislative change would encompass “protein drinks” (see § 45), and we therefore considered whether the meaning of the term “sports drinks” in Item 4A should be expanded to include protein shakes.  However, we decided that this would be incorrect: as Lord Hodge said in PRCBC, an external aid such as the Consultation cannot:
“…displace the meanings conveyed by the words of a statute that, after consideration of that context, are clear and unambiguous and which do not produce absurdity.”
That echoed the words of Lord Neuberger in Williams v Central Bank of Nigeria [2014] UKSC 10 at paragraph [72]
“When interpreting a statute, the court's function is to determine the meaning of the words used in the statute. The fact that context and mischief are factors which must be taken into account does not mean that, when performing its interpretive role, the court can take a free-wheeling view of the intention of Parliament looking at all admissible material, and treating the wording of the statute as merely one item. Context and mischief do not represent a licence to judges to ignore the plain meaning of the words that Parliament has used.'”
Moreover, as we have already noted, Mr Hellier did not make any such submission, while HMRC continue to rely on Arthro Vite to allow protein powders to be zero-rated.
Conclusion
We therefore find that the meaning of a “sports drink” in Item 4A is a drink which contains significant amount of carbohydrate (usually sugar) and may contain salts (such as sodium and potassium).
Having decided on the meaning of the statutory phrase, we next considered whether the Products were “sports drinks”.  As Jacob LJ said in Proctor & Gamble UK v HMRC [2009] EWCA Civ 407 at [14], this is “a short practical question calling for a short practical answer”.
Findings of fact
On the basis of the evidence summarised earlier in this decision, we make the findings set out below.  We make further findings of fact later in this decision.  In making our findings, we considered the many examples and extracts shown to us by the parties, but we have not found it necessary to refer to each and every one of them in our judgment.
Drinks?
The first factual question was whether the Products were “drinks”.  It was common ground that they are not sold in liquid form, but as powders.  However, Item 4A expands the normal meaning of “drinks” to include “syrups, concentrates, essences, powders, crystals or other products” used for the preparation of sports drinks.
However, we agree with Mr Hellier that the overwhelming impression from the packaging and other marketing is that the Products were primarily sold to and used by consumers as powders for the preparation of drinks.  In particular:
At all relevant times, the packaging included a section headed “suggested use”, and continued “mix, shake or blend 1 scoop with 300 ml of your favourite beverage”.
Before 2020 the packaging:
described Classic (our emphases) as a “protein drink mix with sweetener”; and described Plus and Warrior as a “plant protein drink mix”; and
offered a booklet with “over 50 free smoothie recipes” by accessing the website.
The advertising and marketing for the Products contains numerous pictures of smoothies and other drinks containing the Products.
Although Mr Schofield is right that there are examples of the Products being used in food recipes, these are relatively few.
We thus find as a fact that the Products are powders for the preparation of drinks, and so are “drinks” for the purposes of Item 4A.
Findings of fact about the Products’ ingredients
The primary ingredient in all of the Products is plant protein derived from one or more of brown rice, pea protein, hemp, amaranth and/or quinoa.  Other ingredients include chia seed, goji berry, ground coconut, sea salt, coconut oil, stevia extract and/or flavourings such as chocolate or vanilla.  The protein content of the Products ranges from 71g per 100g to 81g.  At all relevant times, the Products also contained between 0.1g and 2g of salts (sodium and potassium, taken together) per 100g, depending on the particular Product and the variety.
The packaging of the Products changed in or around the beginning of 2020, and at or about the same time, there were small changes to the ingredients.  Before the change, Classic and Warrior contained 5% sugar per 100g, or 1g per serving; the chocolate version of Plus contained 1g of carbohydrate per serving, none of which was sugar, while the other versions of Plus had no carbohydrate. After the change, the carbohydrate/sugar content in all Products was less than 0.5g per serving.
Sports drinks?
We have already found that “sports drinks” contain salts (such as sodium and potassium) and significant amounts of carbohydrate (usually sugar).
The maximum level of salts within the Products was 2%, but as we were not provided with any evidence as to the level of salts within a “sports drink”, we were not able to make a comparison.
However, before 2020 the Products contained no more than 1g of carbohydrate per serving; after that date, the level of carbohydrate was less than 0.5g per serving.  On any view, this is not “high percentage” and it is way below the range given by the Canadian Paediatric Society of between 5g and 14g per serving, see §55.  We find as a fact that the Products do not contain the significant levels of carbohydrate found in sports drinks, and are therefore not “sports drinks”.
Item 4A also includes “other similar drinks”. As we explained at §33, those words expand the statutory phrase so it encompasses those “sports drinks” which are not “advertised or marketed as products designed to enhance physical performance [etc]” but are similar to sports drinks which are so designed.  In other words, to come within this part of Item 4A, a product must first be a “sports drink”.  Since the Products are not “sports drinks”, there is no need to consider whether they are the sort of “sports drink” which is advertised or marketed in the way required to fall within Item 4A.
Conclusion
In summary, we have decided that Item 4A sets out a two stage test, so that a product only falls within the exception if it is both a “sports drink” and either (a) advertised or marketed in the way prescribed by the provision, or (b) similar to other sports drinks which are so advertised or marketed.
We have found as facts that:
a “sports drink” is a drink designed for sports people which contain s significant amount of carbohydrate (usually sugar) and salts (such as sodium and potassium); and
although the Products do contain some salts, the quantity of carbohydrate before 2020 was no more than 1g per serving; this was subsequently reduced to almost nothing.
The Products are therefore not sports drinks, and so are not within Item 4A.
THE ALTERNATIVE VIEW
Although we have agreed with Mr Schofield’s analysis of the statutory provision, we went on to consider whether the Products would be within Item 4A if Mr Hellier were to be correct, given that (a) this alternative view was fully argued with extensive reference to the evidence, and (b) this is the first case to be decided on the meaning of Item 4A.
As set out earlier in this judgment, Mr Hellier’s reading of the statutory phrase was that it encompassed:
a “drink” which was “advertised or marketed” as “designed” to do one or more of the following, in a sports context:
enhance physical performance;
accelerate recovery after exercise; or
build bulk;
or was a “similar drink” to one which fell within the above statutory description.
In Mr Hellier’s submission, it is necessary to establish how a product is advertised and marketed in order to know whether it is a “sports drink” and so within Item 4A.  We therefore begin by making findings of fact about the advertising and marketing of Sunwarrior products taken as a whole, followed by findings about each of the three specific Products in issue, Classic, Plus and Warrior.
Findings of fact about approach to advertising and marketing
Under this heading we considered the following: the websites; the customer base; GBN’s catalogue and the Sunwarrior brand.
Websites
The Products are supplied to GBN by Sunwarrior in the US; its website Sunwarrior.com (“the US website”) is accessible to UK consumers. GBN also has its own websites, sunwarrior.co.uk (“the UK website”) and it controls another site, nutrimarket.co.uk (“the Nutrimarket site”).  GBN does not have its own marketing team, and so “piggy backs” on the marketing provided by Sunwarrior in the US.  As a result, much of the marketing on the UK website and on the Nutrimarket site is essentially copied from material on the US website.
The UK website states that Sunwarrior products provide:
“…vegan protein powder and vegetarian protein powder perfect for anyone and any lifestyle, not just vegans. Sunwarrior protein is clean and completelyfree of gluten, GMOs, radiation, artificial flavors, artificial preservatives, artificial colors, soy, yeast, wheat, or added sugar.”
The US website says that its mission is to “Guide Individuals on Their Path to Self-Actualization” and describes its vision as being to “Nourish & Transform the Planet, One Individual at a Time, by Providing Education and the Highest Quality Plant-Based Nutrition”.
The Sunwarrior mission statement can be found on both the US and the UK websites, and reads:
“Sunwarrior is here for every step as you take your nutritional journey to light, energy and love.  We believe the answers to optimal health are found in nature.  Our vision is to taste better and be healthier so that we can accomplish our mission to help you be your best self, performing at your optimum and living your best life. We do this by offering clear, high-quality plant-based ingredients from nature.”
The US website describes Sunwarrior products as “free of solvents, GMOs, radiation, artificial colors, preservatives, and assures a protein that is an easy-to-digest, nutrient-dense superfood”.  That text is illustrated with pictures which include an elderly man with a child in a garden; a man running along a trail and a female runner.
The Nutrimarket site says:
“Lasting wellness and vitality shouldn’t be a privilege – it should be accessible to anyone who cares about their health and wants to live more naturally. Our passionately curated marketplace brings you the world’s healthiest nutrients, supported by expert advice, taking the guesswork out of healthy living.”
The US website has a section headed “sport”, which includes an “Active Protein” product, but this is not sold by GBN.  The UK website has no section called “sport” and the Products are advertised on the UK website under the heading “plant protein”.
As noted at §10, Sunwarrior also created a promotional video entitled (italics in original) “Nutrition for every body”, and another video entitled “I am a Sunwarrior – we are all connected”.  Stills downloaded from the videos show people engaged in a variety of activities including gardening, playing a guitar, drinking with friends, stretching, reading on a sun lounger and ice-skating.  One picture entitled “for the love of the Outdoors” is of two people walking along a tree trunk, while others show elderly people with family members.
The Products are promoted by various ambassadors and influencers.  These include plant-based chefs, vegan activists, nutritionists, musicians, doctors, and yoga practitioners.  Their focus is on healthy living.
On the basis of the above, we find that the website marketing of Sunwarrior products generally, including the videos and the material shared by the influencers, is:
aimed at a wide range of customers, not at athletes or sportspeople; and
focused on facilitating a healthy active lifestyle.
We make further findings below about the website marketing which is specific to each of the Products.
Customer base
GBN supplies health food wholesalers and distributors, and also sells to a number of health food stores.  Some sales are made directly to consumers via the UK website and the Nutrimarket site, as well as through third parties such as Amazon.
Mr Lee said in his witness statement that GBN does not “partner with, distribute, or sell via gyms” and does not “advertise or market with (or target) gyms”.  Mr Hellier drew his attention to GBN’s 2022 customer list for the Products.  There were 64 customers on the list, including one gym, one personal trainer, a company called “Dolphin Fitness Limited” and another called “Kraftwerks Limited”.  Mr Lee knew nothing about those customers, but his unchallenged evidence was that GBN did not market to gyms, or offer them any discount (such as might be available to volume customers).
Having assessed the relevant evidence, we find the following facts:
The Products’ customer base included a small number of providers of fitness services, including one gym.
GBN did not direct any of its marketing to gyms, or give the sector any discounts.
The Catalogue
GBN issued a catalogue of all its products (“the Catalogue”); we infer from its language that it was aimed at wholesalers rather than retail customers.
The first page describes GBN as a “distributor of exclusive natural and organic products” and says it sells “delicious innovative products that make healthy living easy and accessible for everyone”.
The second page sets out GBN’s history, and says the company is:
“driven to empower people to live better with natural healthcare…we source authentic organic and natural products with integrity, containing only the purest raw ingredients”
The Catalogue also explains that the packaging of the Products changed from 2020; that the labels now “do a better job of focusing on the lifestyles of your customers” (emphasis in original), and that “each one remains everything you’ve come to expect from Sunwarrior, amazing proteins made with quality plant-based ingredients”.
We find as facts that:
the emphasis in the Catalogue is on the Products providing healthy plant-based organic products to help customers lead better lives; and
it contains no marketing or advertising which refers to the Products being “designed to enhance physical performance, accelerate recovery after exercise or build bulk”, or anything similar.
The brand
Mr Hellier submitted that the Sunwarrior brand was itself a relevant factor in assessing whether or not the Products met the conditions within Item 4A.  In his submission, the word “warrior” connoted “activity and action”.
Mr Schofield invited us to reject this submission, pointing out that the meaning of the brand name was explained in a video called “Legend of the Nonwarrior”, a link to which had been provided to HMRC.  This said that:
“Sunwarriors through the diligence and faith conquer all darkness, sickness, disease and poverty through the lightening power of an ancient mystery path called agápe [sic]. Through the spirit, knowledge and power of agápe the Sunwarriors were transformed and transcended by pure light energy.”
That passage is echoed in the Sunwarrior mission statement, see §88, which says “Sunwarrior is here for every step as you take your nutritional journey to light, energy and love”; it is also reflected in the post-2020 packaging (see the discussion later in this judgment), which says that Sunwarrior’s mission is to “illuminate body, mind and planet”.
We find as a fact that the brand name is used in the marketing by emphasising the “sun” part of the word “Sunwarrior” rather than by giving any specific meaning to the word “warrior”.
Findings about overall approach
On the basis of our findings of fact about the websites, the customer base, the Catalogue and the brand, we find that the overall focus of both Sunwarrior and GBN’s advertising and marketing is on selling vegan products to a wide range of customers to help them lead healthy active lives and is not targeted at those engaged in sport.
Findings of fact about other products
The Bundle contained examples of the advertising and marketing for other (non-Sunwarrior) products, and we find as facts that claims made by these other products include the following:
“supports muscle building & weight gain”;
“recovery powder…after intense sessions to replace energy and support muscle maintenance and growth”;
“super mass gainer…to support muscle growth, improve training performance and reduce fatigue”;
“Protein on its own will not build muscle…use this all-in-one gainer to repair your body after resistance training, calisthenics, or endurance training”, and
“Enhance muscle, strength & performance”.
Packaging
It was not in dispute that all three of the Products are sold in tubs, with wrap-around packaging designed as having four panels, or sides.  At all relevant times, one side set out the ingredients and amino acid profile for the particular Product.  The other three contained other information, some of which was marketing in nature.  We next consider for each of the Products, the ingredients, the remaining three sides of the packaging, and other marketing.
Classic
We begin with findings of fact, followed by submissions and our conclusions; these include further findings of fact.
Classic –  initial findings of fact
Classic’s main ingredient is brown rice.  It is sold in three varieties, natural (with nothing added), chocolate (with cocoa and flavouring as well as other minor ingredients), and vanilla (with flavouring and the same minor ingredients).
Before 2020, the front panel of the packaging described it as “classic protein” with the word “Protein” in very large font.  Apart from “Sunwarrior”, the words next in size were “Sprouted and fermented” and “Raw vegan superfood”, followed by “Whole grain brown rice protein” and “Complete amino acid profile”.  Below the writing was a picture of waving grass.  On the back panel were the words “Illuminate body, mind and planet”.  The remaining side included three small squares, one of which said “Pre and Post Workout” beneath a running figure.  The other two squares read “Lysine and Leucine” and “Sustainable”.  Each square takes about 1% of the total area covered by the packaging.  Below the squares was the following passage:
“Classic Protein uses enzymes and low temperatures to transform the whole grain of raw, sprouted brown rice into a plant-based protein rich in all the amino acids your body craves. Simple, wholesome and natural, this is uncomplicated nutrition for your complicated life.”
After the change of packaging in 2020, the front panel described it as “Protein classic”, again with the word “Protein” in large print.  It also included the words “clean and simple”, “organic plant-based”; “sprouted and fermented” and “natural”.  In smaller type were the words “20g protein” in white, standing out against the green background; underneath was the word “muscle” in small black type; both the print size and the colour makes it less easy to see.  The previous picture of waving grass was replaced by one showing rice grains.
The back panel has a picture of a woman and child in a garden, underneath which is the following text; the eye is drawn to the emboldened words, including “Plant-based” and “Organic Ingredients”:
“SUNWARRIOR is  committed to making THE BEST plant-based PROTEINS AND SUPPLEMENTS.  Our mission to ILLUMINATE BODY MIND AND PLANET Drives EVERYTHING WE DO from sourcing THE FINEST Organic Ingredients ACROSS THE GLOBE. To recycled and recyclable IT’S WHO WE ARE.”
The remaining side panel is headed “for the conscious warrior” with the word “conscious” in large print; underneath are the words “simply whole grain brown rice”.  In smaller print is the following text:
“Transformed by active enzymes. CLASSIC is gentle, eco-friendly, earthy yet strong.  Relying on just one renewable protein source, this is allergen-friendly nutrition in its purest form, but don’t expect the gentle nature of brown rice to lead to meek results when applied to your active life.  Being a connoisseur of simplicity doesn’t mean you don’t demand the absolute most from your body or your food. Classic won’t disappoint, delivering plenty of protein and balanced amino acids for Conscious Warriors with active lives!”
The US website describes Classic as “a simple protein…an ideal choice for those with food allergies, digestive disorders, chronic illness, or physical trauma”; that text is accompanied by a picture of an elderly man and a child in a garden.  On another webpage is a photograph of a tub of Classic, with cartoon arms and legs in a yoga pose, together with this text:
“Classic Protein relies on the simple power of raw whole-grain brown rice, including the endosperm and bran, to create a gentle protein that still stacks up to the competition in the gym where it matters most. Brown Rice provides a complete and balanced protein, which is essential for muscle and tissue repair.”
The same wording is used on the UK website, but without the final sentence or the cartoon.  That site also says:
“Rice protein is safe for vegans and vegetarians who want to avoid animal products including whey, casein, and egg. But they aren't the only ones to benefit. Rice protein isn't just for vegans, but supplies ample protein and complete amino acids for anyone at any activity level or with any lifestyle. Protein creates a thermic effect, heating up the body. As a complete protein, Sunwarrior's Classic Protein is ready to rebuild and repair muscle after workouts. Rice protein is a little slower to digest than whey, making it a good pre-workout supplement and a good protein for endurance athletes. Lean protein sources, like rice protein, can be incorporated into a healthy weight loss plan”
The UK website also describes Classic as:
“A great tasting smooth, plant-based protein for an unrivalled fitness lifestyle.The ultimate plant-based superfood protein designed for fitness and health enthusiasts. Ideal for those who want to build muscle, lose fat and increase athletic performance.”
Classic – submissions
Mr Schofield submitted that the consumer would understand from the advertising and marketing that Classic had been designed to provide healthy nutrition to people generally.  Mr Hellier relied on the points we have set out in italics below, followed by Mr Schofield’s rebuttals:
The use of the word “muscle” on the packaging.  Mr Hellier submitted that this supported HMRC’s case that Classic met the requirement in Item 4A that it be marketed as designed to “build bulk”.  Mr Schofield responded by saying that the mere use of the word “muscle” did not satisfy the statutory requirement that a product be designed to “build bulk”, and he contrasted it with the marketing used for other products, see §109.
The reference to “delivering plenty of protein and balanced amino acids for Conscious Warriors with active lives”.  Mr Hellier relied on the use of the phrase “active lives”, but Mr Schofield submitted that this did not meet the statutory test, which refers to “enhancing physical performance”.
The square on the pre-2020 packaging entitled “Pre and Post Workout” beneath a running figure.  Mr Hellier said that this plainly showed that Classic was designed to enhance physical performance and/or accelerate recovery after exercise.  Mr Schofield disagreed, saying the square was a tiny part of the packaging.
The website statement that Classic provided protein which was “essential for muscle and tissue repair” Mr Hellier submitted that this showed that Classic was designed to “accelerate recovery after exercise”.  Mr Schofield again disagreed, saying that to fall within Item 4A, a product had not only to be marketed as repairing body tissues, but be designed to “accelerate” recovery after exercise.
The statement in the same passage that Classic “stacks up to the competition in the gym where it matters most”.  Mr Hellier’s position was that the Products were therefore  being marketed as “designed to enhance performance”. Mr Schofield responded by saying that the statement simply describes the result of eating brown rice protein, and added that it would be wrong to place too much weight on this single reference to “competition in the gym”.  In his submission, the overall impression from the packaging and websites was that Classic was advertised and marketed as an organic plant-based protein powder designed to provide nutrition to support an active lifestyle.
The website reference that “rice protein is a little slower to digest than whey, making it a good pre-workout supplement and a good protein for endurance athletes”.  Mr Schofield said that this sentence had to be seen in context: the passage as a whole refers to Classic as being suitable for “anyone at any activity level”, including but not limited to “vegans and vegetarians”.
The drawing showing a tub of Classic in a yoga pose.  Mr Hellier’s position was that yoga was a sport, and that the use of this cartoon showed the Products was advertised or marketed as designed to enhance physical performance etc in a sports context. Mr Schofield did not accept that yoga was a sport, and submitted that in any event the use of a cartoon figure was insufficient to show that Classic was being marketed as designed to “enhance physical performance, aid recovery or build bulk”.
The Tribunal’s conclusions
We agree with Mr Schofield for the reasons he gave, and find the following facts:
The packaging, including the pictures of waving grass and seeds taken together with the text read as a whole, gives the overall impression that Classic was designed to provide plant-based protein rich in amino-acids as a form of simple, organic nutrition.
The typical consumer would not think, from the almost invisible word “muscle”; one tiny square with a running figure and the words “pre-and post workout”; the references to an active life and to rice protein being a good pre-workout supplement and a good protein for endurance athletes; the single mention of competition in the gym, and the cartoon yoga position, that Classic was designed to “enhance physical performance, accelerate recovery after exercise or build bulk”.  Instead, the consumer would understand from the overall advertising and marketing that Classic had been designed to provide healthy nutrition to people generally.  Going to the gym is simply one example of an activity.
We find that Classic was marketed on the basis that it “supplies ample protein and complete amino acids for anyone at any activity level or with any lifestyle”, and not as designed to provide the outcomes listed in Item 4A.
Plus
We first make findings of fact about Plus from the evidence provided, followed by the parties’ submissions and our conclusions, some of which are findings of fact.
Plus – initial findings of fact
Plus is made by blending brown rice, pea, quinoa, and amaranth.  Like Classic, it is sold in three varieties, natural (with nothing added), chocolate (which contains cocoa and flavouring as well as other minor ingredients), and vanilla (with flavouring and the same minor ingredients).
Before 2020, the front panel of the packaging had the word “Plus” in very large letters;, followed by the words “Organic plant-based protein” and “Natural”.  Underneath was a picture of various loose seeds and grains.  The back panel had the same message as Classic: “Illuminate body, mind and planet”.  The remaining side contained the same three small squares as on Classic, although the chocolate version did not have the one with a running figure. In all versions, the squares were followed by this text:
“You’ll love the way it tastes, but how it makes you feel is why we call it Plus.  Plant-based and powerful, Classic Plus builds on the gentle nature of whole-grain brown rice with the strength of pea, chia, quinoa and amaranth protein.  Your Plus is here.  What will you make of it?”
From 2020, the front panel was similar to that for Classic, but with the words “Fit and lean” instead of “Clean and simple”, together with a picture of a pod of peas and two leaves.  The back panel had the same wording as on Classic, see §115, together with a picture of a woman in a yoga pose at sunrise; this covers around 5% of the total space.  The side panel was headed “for the discerning warrior” with the word “discerning” in large print; underneath are the words “5 powerful superfood sources”.  In smaller typeface is the following text:
“Building on our original protein, CLASSIC PLUS kicks up the nutrition with brown rice, legumes, chia seeds, quinoa, and amaranth.  This nutrient-dense protein powerhouse is gentle on digestion while packing plenty of potent BCAAs and essential amino acids in with the natural fiber, vitamins, and minerals. Sprouted, fermented, smooth, and delicious, this is enlightened nutrition for the Fit, Lean, Discerning Warrior who expects a protein to taste as amazing as it makes them feel.”
The US website repeats much of that passage, and also describes Plus as “packed with 5 powerful superfood sources”, and as “a nutrient-dense protein that’s gentle on digestion and essential for a fit and lean lifestyle”. The benefits of each of the four main ingredients are set out, focusing on amino acids, digestive effects and fibre content, and saying that pea protein “helps to build and maintain lean muscle mass, which increases the metabolism and burns fat”.
Officer Shortland’s letter included another extract from either the US or UK website, which read:
“Brown Rice: Provides plenty of protein and fibre while being gentle on the digestive system and kind to those with allergies. This whole-grain superfood is sprouted and ready to take your workouts to new levels with all the amino acids a growing muscle needs. Complete and balanced protein for muscle, building, repair, and maintenance. Rich in Lysine, often missing in plant-based proteins.
Chia seeds are the tiny nutrient-dense powerhouses that the Aztecs used to feed their people, armies, hunting parties and runners.”
A Sunwarrior marketing brochure used by GBN describes Plus as follows:
“Classic Plus protein is packed with 5 powerful superfood sources. It is gentle on digestion and includes plenty of potent BCAAs [branched-chain amino acids] and essential amino acids, natural fiber, vitamins and minerals. This enlightened nutrition is a perfect fit for the discerning Warrior, who expects a protein to taste as amazing as it makes them feel.”
The accompanying picture is of a man meditating in a yoga pose.  Essentially the same text (without the picture) is used  on the GBN website.  The US website  also contains various customer reviews, including “it gives the energy we need in the morning”; “it does not spike my glucose levels”, and “it tastes like a decadent treat”.
Plus - submissions and conclusions
Mr Hellier and Mr Schofield made the same submissions about the word “muscle” and the “Pre and Post Workout” square as they had done for Classic, and we came to the same conclusions.  Mr Hellier also placed reliance on:
the words “Fit” in the phrase “Fit and lean”, but we agreed with Mr Schofield that to fall within Item 4A a product must be marketed as designed to enhance physical performance, and it is not enough to say it is suitable for consumers who are “fit and lean”;
the picture of the woman in a yoga pose on the basis that yoga was a sport.  Mr Schofield did not agree, but we did not need to decide that issue, because we accepted his wider argument that the mere inclusion of this picture was insufficient to show that Plus was advertised or marketed as “designed to enhance physical performance, accelerate recovery after exercise or build bulk”;
the reference to chia seeds being used by runners. However, we rejected this submission: the passage refers to the use of one single ingredient by a previous civilization, who are also described as using chia seeds to “feed their people”; and
the phrase “complete and balanced protein for muscle, building, repair, and maintenance”; we considered in addition the preceding phrase, that “this whole-grain superfood is sprouted and ready to take your workouts to new levels with all the amino acids a growing muscle needs”.  However, this is the only mention of workouts in a passage explaining the benefits of brown rice, which is positioned as a “superfood”.  In addition, these two phrases follow other references to the Product’s digestive benefits and its suitability for those with allergies.  In related correspondence, Mr Daniel Rice of GT said “we consider that to determine the VAT treatment  of Sunwarrior products, it is necessary to focus on the whole product rather than only one ingredient. The marketing strategy applies to the whole product and not to one ingredient. There is no doubt that Sunwarrior Classic Plus is marketed as a nutritious superfood rather than a sports drink”.  We agree.
We find as a fact that Plus is marketed and advertised as suitable for people who are seeking healthy plant-based nutrition, and not as “designed to enhance physical performance, accelerate recovery after exercise or build bulk”.
Warrior
We again begin with findings of fact, followed by submissions and conclusions, some of which are findings of fact.
Warrior – initial findings of fact
Unlike the other two Products, Warrior contains no brown rice, being  instead a blend of protein from peas, hemp and goji berries, together with ground coconut. It is sold in five varieties: natural (with nothing added); chocolate (with cocoa and flavouring and other minor ingredients; vanilla (with flavouring and minor ingredients), mocha (with cocoa, various other flavourings and the same minor ingredients) and berry (with different flavouring and minor ingredients).
Before 2020, the front panel had “Warrior Blend” in large letters, along with the words “natural”, “raw vegan protein” and “complete amino acid profile”; the picture at the bottom is of peas, coconut, berries and grains.  The back panel has the same words “Illuminate body, mind and planet” as on the other Products,  and the remaining side includes the same three small squares, followed by this passage:
“Warrior Blend combines three powerful raw protein sources, fusing the individual benefits of pea, hempseed, and cranberry seed into a smooth, delicious, and nutrient-dense superfood.  Medium chain triglycerides from coconut oil then enhance this dynamic fusion to create a unique, raw, plant-based protein unlike any other”
From 2020, the largest word on the front of the packet was “protein”, followed by “Warrior Blend”, “High Performance” and “organic plant-based”.  Like the other Products, the word “muscle” is present in tiny print.  The back panel has the same wording as set out at §115, together with a picture of a person on a mountain bike, which takes up around 5% of the total space.
The remaining panel is headed “for the active warrior” with the word “active” in large print; underneath are the words “legumes ∙ hempseed ∙ goji berries ∙ coconut MCTs [medium chain triglycerides]”.  In smaller print is the following text:
“Synergy is the secret. Four powerful ingredients combine to make WARRIOR BLEND superior to any single ingredient alone. Want a complete, balanced amino acid profile full of BCAAs to help you build lean muscle?  Want natural antioxidants and electrolytes to enhance your workouts? Want the energy, endurance and recovery found in MCTs to push you further and harder than ever? Demand more from what fuels your active life!  Demand a protein designed for the Active Warrior in you.”
The US website  has a photograph of a tub of Warrior with cartoon arms and legs, lifting weights, followed by this text (capitalisation and emboldening in original):
“Warrior Blend is easily digestible, nutrient filled superfood perfect foranyone who wants to amplify their health and fitness. FOUR POWERFUL INGREDIENT TO INVIGORATE AND FUEL ACTIVE LIFESTYLES.  Warrior Blend fuses and multiplies the power of several rich protein sources into one smooth, great-tasting formula that’s overwhelmingly superior to the individual components alone. Medium chain triglycerides from coconut then join this dynamic fusion to create a unique plant-based protein with a complete amino acid profile exceptionally rich inArginine, Lysine, Leucine, and branched chain amino acids.”
In relation to three of the four key ingredients, it says that:
pea protein “helps to build and maintain lean muscle mass”;
hemp seed “absorbs quickly which provides quick energy”; and
coconut “enhance[s] muscle recovery after exercise
The UK website uses a similar passage to describe Warrior, and adds:
“Medium-chain triglycerides from coconut work synergistically with the other ingredients to create a unique vegan protein exceptionally rich in amino acids and BCAAs. Demand more from what fuels your active life!  Demand a protein designed for the Active Warrior in you.”
The Nutrimarket website says that Warrior “is easy to digest so your body can quickly assimilate and use the protein”, but also that it is “great for Pre and Post-Workout” and provides “a full amino acid profile to build LEAN MUSCLE”.
A marketing brochure issued by Sunwarrior and used by GBN, under the heading “Warrior Blend” displays a picture of a heavily muscled man doing press-ups and of a woman in a gym; it explains that Warrior will “build and repair lean muscle…pre/post workout”, and gives the same information about the key ingredients as on the US website.
Warrior – submissions and conclusion
Mr Hellier relied on the multiple references to the fact that Warrior had been “designed” to produce certain outcomes, pointing out that the Product is marketed on the basis that it:
“combines three powerful raw protein sources, fusing the individual benefits”;
contains “four powerful ingredients [which] combine to make [it] superior to any single ingredient alone”; and
“fuses the power of several rich protein sources into one smooth, great-tasting formula that is overwhelmingly superior to the individual components alone”.
Mr Hellier repeated his submissions about the word “muscle” and the “Pre and Post Workout” square, but also pointed out that the packaging for Warrior contained the words “High performance” together with a picture of a person on a mountain bike, and stressed in particular the wording of the following passage (his emphases):
“Want a complete, balanced amino acid profile full of BCAAs to help you build lean muscle? Want natural antioxidants and electrolytes to enhance your workouts? Want the energy, endurance and recovery found in MCTs to push you further and harder than ever?”
He also relied on the statement that Warrior was “perfect for anyone who wants to amplify their health”, and the photograph/cartoon of the tub lifting weights, together with the wording on the Nutrimarket website that Warrior was “great for Pre and Post-Workout” as well as providing “a full amino acid profile to build LEAN MUSCLE”.
Mr Schofield submitted that those passages had to be seen in the context of Sunwarrior’s and GBN’s overall marketing approach, which as we have found above, focused on the Products’ contribution to a healthy lifestyle.
We agree with Mr Hellier for the reasons he gave that Warrior is marketed as a product “designed to enhance physical performance, accelerate recovery after exercise or build bulk”, and we find that to be a fact.
Similar products?
Mr Hellier asked Mr Lee in cross-examination whether the Products were all “similar in content and advertising” and Mr Lee agreed.  In reliance on his evidence, and the fact that the Products all contained plant proteins and essentially the same additional ingredients, Mr Hellier submitted that if we were to find that one of the Products was “designed to enhance physical performance, accelerate recovery after exercise or build bulk”, we should go on to conclude that the other two were “similar drinks”.
We disagree.  Despite Mr Lee’s concession, and recognising that all the Products consist largely of plant proteins, it is clear from our findings of fact that the primary ingredients used in Warrior are significantly different from those in the other two Products.  Both Classic and Plus are made essentially from brown rice, whereas Warrior is a blend of peas, hemp, goji berries and coconut. The advertising and marketing for Warrior focuses on the “dynamic fusion” of those ingredients, describing it as (our emphases) “a unique, raw, plant-based protein unlike any other”.
In so far as it is relevant (see our discussion about the meaning of the phrase “and other similar drinks” at §34), neither Classic nor Plus is marketed or advertised in a similar way to Warrior, see our findings of fact above.
We therefore reject Mr Hellier’s submission, and find that the other two Products are not “similar drinks” within the meaning of Item 4A.
Conclusion
If Mr Hellier were to be correct as to the statutory interpretation of Item 4A, neither Classic nor Plus would be within Item 4A.  They are thus zero-rated whether or not his reading of the provision is correct.
However, Warrior is marketed as a product “designed to enhance physical performance, accelerate recovery after exercise or build bulk”, and so if Mr Hellier’s reading were to be correct, Warrior would be excluded from zero rating by Item 4A and be standard rated.
FISCAL NEUTRALITY
Mr Schofield submitted that if the Tribunal were to be uncertain as to the correct categorisation of the Products, we should decide the appeal in GBN’s favour in accordance with the principle of fiscal neutrality.  The classic summary of that principle was set out in HMRC v Rank Group plc (2011) Cases C-259/10 and C-260/10 at [36]:
“…the principle of fiscal neutrality must be interpreted as meaning that a difference in treatment for the purposes of VAT of two supplies of services which are identical or similar from the point of view of the consumer and meet the same needs of the consumer is sufficient to establish an infringement of that principle.”
The parties’ submissions
As noted earlier in this decision, HMRC had decided that the Hemple products were outwith Item 4A, see §4.  Mr Schofield submitted that the Products and the Hemple products were “patently similar” and met the same consumer needs, in particular both:
are protein powders, made from the same plant-based proteins;
have similar levels of protein and carbohydrates; and
are consumed as a drink and also added to food.
Mr Hellier submitted that for GBN to succeed in this argument, it would have had to file and serve relevant evidence, but this had not happened.  Instead, the Tribunal had been provided with very little information about the Hemple products, including their advertising and marketing.
The Tribunal’s view
We have been able to decide the appeal without needing to refer to the principle of fiscal equality, but had that been necessary we would have agreed with Mr Hellier that we have insufficient evidence about the Hemple products to decide this case on that basis.  The burden rested on GBN, and had the case depended on its fiscal neutrality argument, HMRC would therefore have succeeded.
OVERALL CONCLUSION AND APPEAL RIGHTS
We allow GBN’s appeal because we have found as follows:
Item 4A applies to certain “sports drinks” and a product which is not a sports drink as that term is normally understood, is not within the exception.
“Sports drinks” are drinks designed for sports people which contain significant levels of carbohydrate (usually sugar) and may contain salts (such as sodium and potassium).
The Products contain low to negligible levels of carbohydrate and so are not “sports drinks”; they thus do not come within Item 4A.
If our statutory interpretation of Item 4A were to be wrong, so that Item 4A applies to any drink advertised or marketed as “designed to enhance physical performance, accelerate recovery after exercise or build bulk” in a sporting context, then:
Classic and Plus do not satisfy those requirements;
Warrior does satisfy the requirements and so would be a “sports drink”;
Neither Classic nor Plus are “similar drinks” to Warrior; and thus
Warrior would be standard rated, and the other two Products zero-rated.
Finally, GBN had not satisfied the evidential requirements necessary to make its case on its fiscal neutrality ground.
