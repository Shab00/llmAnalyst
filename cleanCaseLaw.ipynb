The Applicant\\u2019s application for an order under section 166 of the Data Protection Act 2018 is struck out.\\nThe application is struck out under Rule 8(2)(a) and under Rule 8(3)(c) \\u2013 the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction to entrain this appeal and it has no realistic prospects of success.\\n2. The hearing on 2025-April-9 is vacated.\\n3. The Applicant\\u2019s application for an extension to the hearing time on 2025-April-9 has not been considered as that hearing has been vacated in its entirety.\\nReasons\\nThe Applicant made a data handling complaint to the Respondent on 2024-September-12 and received an outcome decision from the Respondent on 2024-October-10.  The Applicant made an application dated 2024-November-18 and received by the Tribunal on 19th November for an order under section 166 of the Data Protection Act 2018.  The Tribunal received some documents from the Applicant before that date but without the required GRC 1 appeal application form to set out what he was applying for.\\nHaving seen the original complaint, it runs to 63 pages with the exhibited correspondence.  He complains about access to his online health records and the criminal intent not to allow him access.  He includes headings for other complaints but gave no detail and at page 11 confirmed that his renewed complaint only covered the denial of access to his medical records online.  It was clear from his correspondence that there was quite a history between the Applicant and the data processor that had also involved the ICO at times.\\nThe application form confirmed that the Applicant was making an application under section 166 of the Data Protection Act 2018 which can be made in circumstances \\u201cwhere the ICO fails to take appropriate procedural steps to respond to the complaint\\u2026\\u201d  He sought an order that the ICO comply with section 166, and asked that the Tribunal give further consideration to the Human Rights element associated with his case and how it affected him as a disabled vulnerable adult.\\nThe 34 page separate grounds of appeal were headed \\u201cappeal grounds against the ICO decision\\u201d and confirmed that he had made a number of complaints to the ICO and was challenging the procedural steps taken by the ICO in its statutory function, in its investigative process and how it communicated those steps in the outcome decision.  He said that his complaint was in regard to his sensitive medical data being shared between medical care providers and how his confidential information had not been safeguarded.  He described the events as a conspiracy that had led to attempts to deprive him of his liberty based on fraudulent assessments that had been shared.  He contended that the ICO was well aware of his repeated complaints and had failed to take \\u201cappropriate steps\\u201d in the investigation.  He submitted that there had been a procedural failure not to establish the facts and assess the explanation given by the data handler.  He challenged the response by the data handler and the ICOs acceptance of their position.  He set out in some detail his challenge to the position of the data handler and the ICO.  He aligned himself with the case of EW in Killock where an order to progress was made.\\nThe ICO responded on 2024-December-13 and invited the Tribunal to strike out the Applicant\\u2019s application.  The response identified that senior judges had confirmed that the ICO had a wide discretion to deal with complaints as an expert Regulator.  It was for the ICO to conduct their investigation and it is not the function of the Tribunal to substitute its own view for that of the Regulator absent a good reason.\\nThe chronology provided by the ICO confirmed that the ICO made some enquiries with the data handler and confirmed that online access to his medical data was not available due to the inability to redact third party data but that the surgery offered to provide the Applicant with copies in paper format or electronic format.  This was conveyed to the Applicant.  The Applicant was unhappy with the outcome and asked for an internal review which was undertaken and confirmed the original outcome.\\nThe Applicant was asked to respond to the strike out application which he did within a 32 page document dated 2025-January-16.  There was reference to initial directions made and non-compliance by the ICO.  This appeal/application was miscategorised as the Applicant failed to file a GRC 1 application when he sent in his documents and so the wrong standard directions were issued by the Tribunal. The ICO was correct in identifying that the wrong directions had been issued.  Due to the workload of the Tribunal, that had not been actioned.\\nThe Applicant referred to the ICO attempting to mislead the Tribunal about the nature of the Applicant\\u2019s case \\u2013 he was not challenging the outcome but he appropriateness of the steps taken in the investigation.  To that end, he considered the ICO was in contempt.  He said that the ICO had committed a procedural violation by not advising him of his right to make an application under section 166.  He submitted that the Tribunal could deal with procedural failures.  The Tribunal had to look at the underlying merits of any complaint as part of the procedural focus under section 166.  He cites an CJEU ruling (without providing a copy) but omits to recognise that CJEU decisions are no longer binding following Brexit.  He submits that the ICO is bound to provide information at how it arrived at the decision he did.  It is unclear what the Applicant says is missing noting the nature of the original complaint.  He was advised why he could not have online access and an alternate solution was provided.  He submitted that the Tribunal need not disregard the objective standard to which an investigation should be conducted.  He said the case of EW in Killock closely matched his case.  The Tribunal had jurisdiction to consider his application with a focus on the ICO\\u2019s policies and procedures.  The ICO was required to obtain a documented decision from the data handler and did not do so.\\nHe submitted that the Tribunal had jurisdiction to order the Respondent to re-issue its outcome to the extent that the first outcome was procedurally flawed.\\nLegal framework relating to section 166 applications\\nUnder s166(2), the Tribunal is given power to order the ICO to \\u201ctake appropriate steps to respond to the complaint\\u201d.\\nUpper Tribunal Judge Wikeley in Leighton v Information Commissioner (No.2) [2020] UKUT 23 (AAC) at para 31 described section 166 applications as \\u2013 \\u201cthe mischiefs identified by section 166(1) are all procedural failings. \\u201cAppropriate steps\\u201d mean just that, and not an \\u201cappropriate outcome\\u201d. Likewise, the FTT\\u2019s powers include making an order that the Commissioner \\u201ctake appropriate steps to respond to the complaint\\u201d, and not to \\u201ctake appropriate steps to resolve the complaint\\u201d, least of all to resolve the matter to the satisfaction of the complainant.\\u201d\\nThe remit of section 166 orders was reconsidered by the Upper Tribunal in Killock v Information Commissioner [2021] UKUT 299.  One of the difficulties with this judgment is that read literally the judgment of Farbey J at paras 83 to 86 may lead the reader to believe that the Tribunal can specify what appropriate steps the Commissioner should take to deal with a complaint.\\nBut at paragraph 87 some important clarification is given \\u2013\\n\\u201cMoreover, s.166 is a forward-looking provision, concerned with remedying ongoing procedural defects that stand in the way of the timely resolution of a complaint. The Tribunal is tasked with specifying appropriate \\u201csteps to respond\\u201d and not with assessing the appropriateness of a response that has already been given (which would raise substantial regulatory questions susceptible only to the supervision of the High Court). It will do so in the context of securing the progress of the complaint in question. We do not rule out circumstances in which a complainant, having received an outcome to his or her complaint under s.165(b), may ask the Tribunal to wind back the clock and to make an order for an appropriate step to be taken in response to the complaint under s.166(2)(a). However, should that happen, the Tribunal will cast a critical eye to assure itself that the complainant is not using the s.166 process to achieve a different complaint outcome.\\u201d\\nThe only reason why EWs case was treated differently is that it was conceded that the complaint had been rejected by the Commissioner and not investigated at all due to a misinterpretation of the ICO\\u2019s policies.  At para 116 Farbey J explained that \\u2013 \\u201cAs we have explained above, s.166 is a procedural, not a substantive, remedy which provides for a right of appeal to the Tribunal on process, where the Commissioner fails to address a complaint under s.165 DPA 2018 in a procedurally proper fashion. However, as we have concluded above, the appropriateness of the investigative steps taken by the Commissioner is an objective matter which is within the jurisdiction of the Tribunal and is not something solely within the remit of the Commissioner to determine for herself. In our judgment, by misconstruing and misapplying her own Service Standards, and thereby simply declining to investigate the complaints at all, the Commissioner did not take such steps as were appropriate to respond to the complaints.\\u201d\\nThe case of Killock highlights that the outcome may result in a decision to take no action.  The outcome is not necessarily a determination of a breach of GDPR and action on a breach.  The complaint may remain on record or advice given.  The ICO has a broad discretion both in terms of investigation and outcome.\\nThe issue was further considered by the High Court and then by the Court of Appeal in the case of Delo v Information Commissioner [2023] EWCA Civ 1141.\\nAt paragraph 94 of the Court of Appeal\\u2019s decision in Delo \\u2013 \\u201cI do not accept Mr Delo\\u2019s argument that the Commissioner is obliged to operate the complaints regime as a cost-free alternative to a claim under Article 79. The Commissioner has a discretion. The funding obligation enshrined in Recital 120 is not to be read as a blank cheque, or as authorising unnecessary or wasteful regulatory action. It must be legitimate for the Commissioner, when deciding how to deploy the available resources, to take account not only of his own view of the likely outcome of further investigation and the likely merits, but also of any alternative methods of enforcement that are available to the data subject.\\u201d  That case definitively set out that the Commissioner does not have to reach an outcome decision on the details of the complaint and that he may decide how to investigate the merits of the complaint. The Court of Appeal is a higher authority than the Upper Tribunal in the event of any conflict between decisions.\\nThe issue was revisited in Cortes v information Commissioner [2023] UA-2023-001298 by UTJ Wikeley where he helpfully summarised the authoritative cases of Killock and Delo.  At para 31 Judge Wikeley responded to the submission that section 166 in effect enabled an Applicant to challenge whether the Commissioner had investigated the subject matter of the complaint to the extent appropriate and thus as a potential failure to take appropriate steps to respond to the complaint.   In response, UTJ Wikleley said \\u201cBut this is just another example of the \\u201csleight of hand\\u201d identified by Mostyn J in R (on the application of Delo); it is an attempt to clothe a merits-based outcome decision with the garments of procedural failings. If the FTT were to order the Commissioner under section 166 to take further alternative steps, in the absence of quite exceptional circumstances such as those in EW v IC, then the outcome of the complaint would necessarily be subject to an impermissible collateral challenge \\u2013 a challenge that the case law confirms beyond any doubt could only be launched by way of a judicial review.\\u201d\\nAt para 32 of Mostyn J\\u2019s decision in Delo he acknowledged the very wide scope of the Commissioner\\u2019s discretion to handle complaints under section 166 as he thinks best. Indeed, it extended as far as permitting the Commissioner to take no further action on even a non-spurious complaint, a finding echoed by the Court of Appeal. He was clear that the Commissioner had handled the Appellant\\u2019s complaint albeit the Appellant was not satisfied with the outcome. He said that the purpose of section 166 is also evident from its heading \\u2013 it provides for \\u201cOrders to progress complaints\\u201d, not for \\u201cOrders to re-open or re-investigate complaints\\u201d.  As his complaint had been progressed to an outcome, and so there was no longer any scope for a section 166 order to bite. As Mostyn J held, section 166 \\u201cby its terms applies only where the claim is pending and has not reached the outcome stage and the Tribunal is tasked with specifying appropriate \\u201csteps to respond\\u201d and not with assessing the appropriateness of a response that has already been given (which would raise substantial regulatory questions susceptible only to the supervision of the High Court). It will do so in the context of securing the progress of the complaint in question\\u201d\\nWhat the consistent case-law advises is that there will be rare cases where the Tribunal, other than in a delayed and pending investigation of a complaint, may make an order to progress in cases, for example, where the Commissioner has declined to accept the complaint in circumstances where it should be accepted.  There is some minor dispute whether that is a power exercisable by the First Tier Tribunal or by judicial review.  The jurisprudence is absolutely clear about the broad discretion of the Commissioner as to the nature of the investigation and range of outcome actions at his disposal. This Tribunal has no power to supervise the Commissioner or review the appropriateness of an investigation.\\nConclusions\\nIt is clear from the documents that the Commissioner accepted Mr Hart\\u2019s complaint, spoke to the data handler and decided to recommend an alternate solution to provide Mr Hart with the information he needed in a way that the data handler could provide.  Mr Hart believes the Commissioner should have done more, albeit has not specified what else the Commissioner should have done.  The Appellant has conflated his complaint with other complaints that he has previously made which he appeared equally dissatisfied about.  Whilst it is unfortunate that Mr Hart is unhappy with the outcome, Mr Hart\\u2019s case is very different to that of EW who had not had a complaint accepted or investigated at all.\\nOn any objective examination, the Appellant is seeking to re-open the investigation to obtain a different outcome, whether or not that is explicitly stated and that is also outside of this Tribunals\\u2019 jurisdiction.  There is no realistic prospect of him being successful.\\nMr Hart mentions in his response that he wishes to certify a contempt of court against the Commissioner on the basis that the Commission has misled the Tribunal about the basis of the appeal.  Mr Hart has not lodged any such application which would need to be on the correct application in any event but it was clear from the Commissioner\\u2019s response that in effect Mr Hart was challenging the outcome.  He wanted a different investigation and for it to lead to a different outcome; otherwise why would he challenge the investigation.  There was no misrepresentation of his case in my judgment and no basis for any allegation of contempt.  The Respondent dealt with all the issues thoroughly in the response document.\\nThe Tribunal has considered the documents lodged in the appeal and respective submissions on the strike out application.  The Appellant\\u2019s application was made after an investigation that led to an outcome.  The Tribunal had no basis to consider his application on the basis that his complaint had been considered and responded to, and additionally his application was bound to fail.\\nAccordingly, the application is struck out under Rule 8(2)(a) and 8(3)(c).\\nDistrict Judge Moan\\n2025-January-21\\nDecision given on: 2025-January-23\\n[2025] UKFTT 62 (GRC)\\nThe original format of the judgment as handed down by the court, for printing and downloading.\\nThe judgment in machine-readable LegalDocML format for developers, data scientists and researchers.\\nAll content is available under the Open Justice Licence.\\n        \\n        For re-use that is not covered by the Open Justice Licence, please apply for licence to do computational analysis..\",\n          \"Judgments and decisions from 2001 onwards\\n[2025] EWHC 140 (Comm)\\nBUSINESS AND PROPERTY COURTS OF ENGLAND AND WALES\\nCOMMERCIAL COURT\\nRoyal Courts of Justice, Rolls Building\\nFetter Lane, London, EC4A 1NL\\nBefore :\\nPAUL MITCHELL KC\\n(Sitting as a Deputy High Court Judge)\\nBetween :\\nWH HOLDING LIMITED\\nClaimant\\n- and -\\nE20 STADIUM LLP\\nDefendant\\nPaul Downes KC (instructed by Gateley Plc) for the Claimant\\nThomas Plewman KC (instructed by Pinsent Masons LLP) for the Defendant\\nHearing date: 12 December 2024\\nJUDGMENT\\nPAUL MITCHELL KC:\\nIntroductory\\nThis is a claim for declaratory relief commenced by WH Holding Limited (\\u201cWHH\\u201d) by a Part 8 claim form on 18 December 2023.  WHH contends that it is not bound by a reasoned expert determination because that determination contains what WHH says are \\u201cmanifest errors\\u201d.\\nWHH and the Defendant, E20 Stadium LLP (\\u201cE20\\u201d), are two of the three parties to a Concession Agreement made on 22 March 2013 (\\u201cthe Agreement\\u201d).  By the Agreement, E20 (described as \\u201cthe Grantor\\u201d) granted a 99-year concession to WHH (described as \\u201cthe Concessionaire\\u201d) that permitted WHH to run sporting events at the London Stadium in the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park (\\u201cthe Stadium\\u201d).  One of the effects of the Agreement was to give West Ham United Football Club Limited (\\u201cthe Club\\u201d) the use of the Stadium as a home ground, and the Club was a party to the Agreement.\\nThe costs of constructing the Stadium had been met from public funds as part of the investment in the 2012 London Olympics.  At the date of entry into the Agreement, most of the shares in WHH were held (directly and indirectly) in large part by Mr David Sullivan (\\u201cMr Sullivan\\u201d) and Mr David Gold (\\u201cMr Gold\\u201d) (now deceased). Mr Sullivan and Mr Gold, persons owned or controlled by them, and their \\u201cfamily members\\u201d (as also defined in the Agreement) were categorised in the Agreement as \\u201cRelevant Shareholders\\u201d. Within Clause 20 of the Agreement were provisions which were described to me as an \\u201canti-embarrassment\\u201d clause.  The broad effect of the provisions in question was to ensure that E20 was able to share in gains that might in future be made by a Relevant Shareholder if such Relevant Shareholder effected a transaction which amounted to a sale or transfer of any interest in the Club. The formulation is accepted by the parties as encompassing dealings by Relevant Shareholders with their shareholdings in WHH, which owned 100% of the Club.\\nI shall consider the operation of Clause 20 in detail below.  It suffices at this stage to say that if the provisions of Clause 20 were met, then WHH was obliged to pay to E20 a sum which was termed a \\u201cStadium Premium Amount\\u201d.  The Stadium Premium Amount was effectively a share of the profits that had been made by the Relevant Shareholder, but payable by WHH rather than by the Relevant Shareholder personally.\\nOn 10 November 2021, a number of shareholders in the Club entered a series of agreements with an entity called 1890 Holdings AS (\\u201c1890 Holdings\\u201d).  Among those shareholders were various Relevant Shareholders.  A dispute then arose between WHH and E20 regarding the effect of the anti-embarrassment provisions of Clause 20 having regard to a put and call option agreement (\\u201cthe Option\\u201d) entered by Mr Sullivan and 1890 Holdings. Stated shortly, WHH contended that following the provisions of Clause 20, no Stadium Premium Amount was due as a result of the Option; whereas E20 contended that the correct application of Clause 20 resulted in WHH being obliged to pay it a Stadium Premium Amount of \\u00a33.6 million.\\nClause 50 of the Agreement provided that any dispute which related to Clause 20 was to be referred to an expert, whose decision was to be final and binding \\u201cin the absence of manifest error\\u201d. The parties agreed to put their dispute regarding whether any Stadium Premium Amount was due in relation to the Option before an expert.  The expert determined the issue in favour of E20 in a reasoned written opinion; but WHH contends that the expert made two errors which should be recognised as \\u201cmanifest errors\\u201d.  If WHH is correct in relation to one or both of those contentions, then the expert\\u2019s determination is not binding on WHH and E20.\\nWHH was represented before me by Mr Paul Downes KC and E20 by Mr Thomas Plewman KC.  I am grateful to them both for their very helpful and focussed written and oral submissions.\\nThe judgment below comprises five parts, as follows:\\nPart 1: the contractual framework for the expert determination.\\nPart 2: the law relating to expert determination and manifest error exception clauses.\\nPart 3: the dispute between the parties and how the expert resolved it.\\nPart 4: did the determination contain \\u201cmanifest errors\\u201d?\\nPart 5: conclusion.\\nPart 1: the contractual framework for the expert determination\\nClause 50 of the Agreement provides, in relevant part:\\n\\u201cAny dispute between the Grantor and the Concessionaire which\\u2026 relates to\\u2026 [Clause] 20 (Usage Fee for Use of the Stadium and Other Payments)\\u2026 must be determined by an expert in accordance with this Clause 50 (Expert Determination) (a Matter for Expert Determination), [and] shall be resolved in accordance with this Clause 50 (Expert Determination).\\nA Matter for Expert Determination shall be referred at the request of either the Grantor or the Concessionaire (a Request), for determination by an independent expert.  The Grantor and the Concessionaire shall agree on the appointment of the expert and shall agree with the expert the terms of his appointment.\\nThe expert appointed may be an individual\\u2026 and shall be generally recognised as an expert with a specialist capacity or area of knowledge in relation to the relevant issues that both the Concessionaire and the Grantor agree is relevant to the Matter for Expert Determination.\\nAn expert appointed pursuant to this Clause 50 (Expert Determination) shall act on the following basis:\\non his appointment, the expert shall confirm his neutrality, independence and the absence of conflicts in determining the Matter for Expert Determination;\\nthe expert shall comply with the terms of this Agreement and act as an expert and not as an arbitrator\\nthe expert\\u2019s determination shall (in the absence of manifest error) be final and binding on the Grantor, the Club and the Concessionaire and not be subject to appeal;\\nthe expert shall decide the procedure to be followed in the determination and shall be requested to make his determination in writing within 30 days after his appointment or as soon as practicable thereafter;\\nthe expert shall determine how and by whom the costs of the determination, including the fees and expenses of the expert, are to be paid; and\\npending the expert\\u2019s decision as to the costs of the determination, the costs shall be borne equally by the Concessionaire and the Grantor\\u201d.\\nThe dispute between WHH and E20 having arisen, on 14 December 2022 the parties entered into an agreement with the expert they had jointly chosen to determine that dispute, Mr Terence Mowschenson KC.  I refer to this agreement as \\u201cthe Expert Agreement\\u201d.\\nThe recitals to the Expert Agreement contained a definition of \\u201cthe Dispute\\u201d to be resolved by the expert: \\u201cwhether a Stadium Premium Amount is due to the First Party [E20] from the Second Party [WHH] in respect of an Option Agreement entered into by the Second Party [WHH] on 10 November 2021\\u201d.  I note in passing that this definition was erroneous: WHH had not entered any Option Agreement on 10 November 2021.  The option agreement that gave rise to the dispute was the Option as described above, to which the relevant parties were Mr Sullivan and 1890 Holdings.\\nThe Expert Agreement recorded that the expert had agreed to accept the reference on the following terms, in relevant part:\\nThe Parties agree that the Expert will resolve the Dispute by expert determination (\\u201cthe Expert Determination\\u201d).  The Expert will act as an expert, not as an arbitrator.\\nThe Expert Determination will lead to a binding determination which must be in accordance with the Agreement [this term was not defined in the Expert Agreement, but presumably the parties were referring to the Agreement as defined earlier in this judgment].\\nThe Parties and each of them agree with each other, and with the Expert, that the Expert shall:\\ndecide any issues of fact or opinion on the material provided to the Expert by the Parties and each of them\\nbe under no duty to the Parties or to each of them to make any inquiries or investigations of his own and\\nbe entitled to proceed to give his Decision should one or both Parties fail to act in accordance with the procedures decided by the Expert\\nThe Decision of the Expert shall include reasons and will accord with clause 14 of the Agreement [the reference to Clause 14 of the Agreement is erroneous, as that clause concerns public liability insurance]\\nThe Parties agree that they are not permitted to challenge the Decision in any legal proceedings or otherwise, save where such challenge arises as a result of manifest error or fraud on the part of the Expert.\\nThe Parties expressly acknowledge that the Expert shall not be liable to the Parties for any act or omission whatsoever in connection with this Expert Determination.\\nNeither Party will call the Expert as a witness, consultant, or in any other capacity in any litigation or arbitration or other dispute resolution process in relation to the Dispute and the Expert will not act voluntarily in such capacity without the written agreement of both parties\\u201d.\\nThe contractual framework accordingly provided as follows.\\nFirst, the expert was instructed to act as such and not as an arbitrator.  The difference between the two was described by Cooke J in Bernhard Schulte GmbH & Co v Nile Holdings Ltd [2004] EWHC 977 (Comm), [2004] 2 Lloyd\\u2019s Rep 352, at [95]:\\n\\u201cThere is an essential distinction between judicial decisions and expert decisions, although the reason for the distinction has been variously expressed. There is no useful purpose in phraseology such as \\u2018quasi judicial\\u2019 or \\u2018quasi arbitral\\u2019 as Lord Simon made plain in\\u00a0Arenson\\u00a0[Arenson v Arenson [1977] AC 405] and although the use of the word \\u2018expert\\u2019 is not conclusive, the historic phrase \\u2018acting as an expert and not as an arbitrator\\u2019 connotes a concept which is clear in its effect. A person sitting in a judicial capacity decides matters on the basis of submissions and evidence put before him, whereas the expert, subject to the express provisions of his remit, is entitled to carry out his own investigations, form his own opinion and come to his own conclusion regardless of any submissions or evidence adduced by the parties themselves.\\u201d\\nHere, the express provisions of the expert\\u2019s remit did not forbid him from carrying out his own investigations, forming his own opinion or coming to his own conclusions. He was not obliged to make his determination within the bounds of the submissions made to him by the parties; he was retained to resolve the dispute by using his expertise to make a correct determination.\\nSecond, the expert\\u2019s instruction to decide any issues of opinion put before him, in my judgment, clearly covers his deciding issues of law.\\nThird, neither of the parties were to have recourse to the expert in respect of any act or omission of his \\u201cwhatsoever\\u201d.  The only remedy open to a party in any circumstance, therefore, was to establish that the expert determination was not binding as a result of manifest error or fraud on the part of the expert.\\nPart 2: the law relating to expert determination and manifest error exception clauses\\nThe starting point: agreements are to be kept to\\nWhere two parties to a contract have agreed that an expert shall be tasked with determining a question of importance to them and that they will be bound by the determination, the starting point is that they will be held to their agreement as long as the expert has not departed from his instructions and absent fraud or bad faith: Jones & Ors v Sherwood Computer Services plc [1992] 1 WLR 277, CA.\\nIt was once the law that any mistake on the part of the expert made while loyally seeking to comply with his instructions would vitiate the entire report, but that view of the law was rejected in the 1970s for the reasons explained by Simon Brown LJ in Veba Oil Supply & Trading GmbH v Petrotrade Inc (\\u201cThe Robin\\u201d) [2001] EWCA Civ 1832, [2002] CLC 405 at [22]:\\n\\u201cI come next to this court\\u2019s decision in Jones v Sherwood Computer Services plc [1992] 1 WLR 277 upholding an expert\\u2019s report on the basis that the experts had done precisely what they had been instructed to do.  In the course of a judgment which considered a large number of authorities, Dillon LJ noted first, the development of the law in the mid-1970s establishing that an expert could be liable for damages if he had acted negligently in giving his certificate (see the House of Lords\\u2019 decisions in Sutcliffe v Thackrah [1974] AC 727 and Arenson v Arenson [1977] AC 405); secondly, that this required reconsideration of the principle that a certificate could be vitiated for mistake (how could an expert be liable for a negligent mistake in giving a certificate if the effect of that mistake was that the certificate was not binding on the parties?); and thirdly, that accordingly, in Campbell v Edwards [1976] 1 WLR 403 and Baber v Kenwood Manufacturing Co Ltd [1978] 1 Ll Rep 175, this court \\u2018look[ed] at the question of setting aside certificates of experts on grounds of mistake afresh in light of the principle that the expert or valuer can be sued for negligence\\u2019.\\u201d\\nThe \\u2018manifest error\\u2019 exception\\nVeba was decided on the basis that the experts had materially departed from their instructions: they had been instructed to assess the quality of gasoil by using the American Society of Testing and Materials\\u2019 method number D1298, but they had not used that method.  It followed that the parties had not received the determination they had agreed to be bound by. The contract between the parties had also provided they would not be bound by the expert\\u2019s determination as to quality if it contained \\u201cmanifest error\\u201d.  Simon Brown LJ considered what might amount to a manifest error and what the consequences of such an error would be:\\nAlthough that conclusion is sufficient to dispose of the appeal, I would touch briefly on the alternative basis for decision relied upon by the Buyers, the reference in clause 10 to \\u2018manifest error\\u2019. Morison J below went no further than to say that he was \\u2018inclined to the view that there was a manifest error here, due to the wrong test being used\\u2019.\\nMorison J had previously considered the meaning of \\u201cmanifest error\\u201d in\\u00a0Conoco (UK) Ltd v Phillips Petroleum (unreported, 19 August 1996) where, following\\u00a0dicta\\u00a0in earlier cases, he held that manifest error referred to: \\u2018oversights and blunders so obvious as to admit of no difference of opinion\\u2019.\\nThe question then arising is whether it is relevant to consider whether the error is one that affected the result. Considering that question in\\u00a0Conoco v Phillips, Morison J said this:\\n\\u2018\\u2026 it seems to me that there is no room for any debate as to whether the oversight or blunder would or would not have made any material difference to the result. If it could be shown that there was a manifest error then in my judgment that would be an end of the case. If fraud was shown, I cannot accept that it would be open to debate as to whether the fraud did or did not affect the result; so also would manifest error.\\u2019\\nI confess to some difficulty with this approach. Fraud, of course, would vitiate the determination irrespective of whether it affected the result: \\u2018Fraud or collusion unravels everything\\u2019 (per Lord Denning in\\u00a0Campbell v Edwards). The exception for \\u2018manifest error\\u2019, however, seems to me of a rather different character and to be designed essentially to fill the gap in the law created by the development to which I have already referred: the overthrow of the\\u00a0Dean v Prince\\u00a0principle of setting aside determinations for mistake. Nowadays, if parties wish to contract on the basis that they will not be held to mistakes made by the expert in the course of carrying out his instructions, they must needs include a term like this with regard to manifest error. But if they do, is it then really to be said that provided only the mistake is obvious, the determination will be avoided irrespective of whether it could affect the outcome? In this context I am inclined to think not. Take the very error committed in\\u00a0Frank H. Wright (Constructions) Limited v Frodoor, the erroneous inclusion of a \\u2018not\\u2019 in the report. I do not think that that ought properly to be regarded as a \\u2018manifest error\\u2019. Rather I would extend the \\u2018definition\\u2019 of manifest errors as follows: \\u2018oversights and blunders so obvious\\u00a0and obviously capable of affecting the determination\\u00a0as to admit of no difference of opinion\\u2019. (emphasis added)\\u201d.\\nIt is worth noting that even though what Simon Brown LJ termed, at [26(iii)] \\u201cthe modern law\\u201d regarding the effect of expert mistakes was founded on the realisation that experts could be sued for negligence, it has nowhere been said that for an expert\\u2019s error to be recognised as \\u201cmanifest\\u201d it must effectively be found that the expert has acted negligently.  It is perfectly possible to be in error, particularly regarding the law, without being negligent. The difficulty is identifying whether any error that has been established should be characterised as \\u201cmanifest\\u201d.\\nAs in Veba itself, a common circumstance in which the court is required to consider the effect of alleged mistakes by an expert is in the context of expert certification of facts. Such certification is usually provided for in conclusive evidence clauses, by which the parties to a contract have agreed what shall amount to adequate proof of a relevant fact. Clauses such as this exist to prevent disputes arising between the parties by providing for a reliable external measurement of a critical value. Doubtless for the reason given by Simon Brown LJ in Veba, it is common for the parties to provide in such clauses for a measure of protection against error on the part of the expert, by way of a \\u201cmanifest error\\u201d exception: a certificate will be binding in the absence of manifest error.\\nThere are many cases in which challenges to an expert determination of a single datum have been considered and much of the law relating to the meaning of \\u201cmanifest error\\u201d exceptions has been developed in the context of contracts providing for the certification of a fact within a conclusive evidence clause: see, for example, Society of Lloyds v Fraser [1998] Lloyd\\u2019s Rep IR 156 CA (maximum potential liability of an insurer); Galaxy Energy International Ltd (BVI) v Eurobunker SpA [2001] Lloyd\\u2019s Rep 725 and Veba (technical characteristics/ quantity and quality of product shipped in bulk); IIG Capital LLC v Van der Merwe [2008] EWCA Civ 542 and North Shore Ventures v Anstead Holdings [2011] EWCA Civ 230, [2011] 2 Lloyd\\u2019s Rep 45 (sum owed by a debtor which must be paid by a guarantor); Amey Birmingham Highways Ltd v Birmingham City Council [2018] EWCA Civ 264, [2018] BLR 225 (certification of completion of milestones in a contract to repair, maintain, manage and operate a road network).\\nThe parties before me were agreed that the most authoritative summary of the usual likely meaning of \\u201cmanifest error\\u201d is that contained in the recent decision of the Supreme Court in Sara & Hossein Asset Holdings Ltd v Blacks Outdoor Retail Ltd [2023] UKSC 2, [2023] 1 WLR 575. That case concerned a lease which provided that a landlord\\u2019s certification of the amount due from the tenant by way of its share of the total cost of providing various services and expenses was conclusive evidence of the sum due from the tenant \\u201cin the absence of manifest or mathematical error or fraud\\u201d. The landlord had served certificates on the tenant in support of claimed service charges for two years, which the tenant then refused to pay on the basis that the certificated total costs towards which it was being asked to contribute included items of expenditure that were unnecessary and fell outside the terms of the lease. The landlord sued and sought summary judgment; the tenant defended by asserting that the certificates were not conclusive evidence of any sums due because they contained manifest errors.  Lord Hamblen JSC said this at [30] to [34]:\\n\\u201cManifest error\\nThe narrowness of the permitted defences of \\u2018manifest or mathematical error or fraud\\u2019 is relevant to the implications of the interpretation that the landlord's certification is conclusive subject only to those defences. \\u2018Mathematical error\\u2019 and \\u2018fraud\\u2019 are self-explanatory terms but the meaning of \\u2018manifest error\\u2019 is less clear. Whilst its precise meaning may depend on the particular contract and context in which it is used, there are a number of authorities which have considered the meaning of these words in conclusive evidence clauses.\\nAn often cited and applied explanation of the meaning of \\u2018manifest error\\u2019 is that given by Lewison J in\\u00a0IIG Capital LLC v Van Der Merwe\\u00a0[2008] 1 All ER (Comm) 435 at para 52: \\u201cA \\u2018manifest error\\u2019 is one that is obvious or easily demonstrable without extensive investigation.\\u201d This formulation was approved by the Court of Appeal in the same case\\u00a0[2008] 2 Lloyd's Rep 187 (per Waller LJ at paras 33\\u201335)\\u00a0and more recently in\\u00a0Amey Birmingham Highways Ltd v Birmingham City Council [2018] BLR 225 (per Jackson LJ at paras 83\\u201387).\\nGuidance as to what is meant by being \\u2018obvious or easily demonstrable\\u2019 is provided by the Court of Appeal's decision in\\u00a0Veba Oil Supply & Trading GmbH v Petrotrade Inc [2002] 1 All ER 703\\u00a0in which it was stated that manifest errors were \\u2018oversights and blunders so obvious\\u00a0and obviously capable of affecting the determination as to admit of no\\u00a0difference of opinion\\u2019 (per Simon Brown LJ at para 33, his emphasis). This has been applied in a number of recent first instance decisions \\u2013 see, for example,\\u00a0Septo Trading Inc v Tintrade Ltd [2021] 1 Lloyd's Rep 258 (Teare J),\\u00a0Flowgroup plc v Co-operative Energy Ltd [2021] Bus LR 755\\u00a0(Deputy High Court Judge Adrian Beltrami QC),\\u00a0Euler Hermes SA (NV) v Mackays Stores Group Ltd [2022] EWHC 1918 (Comm)\\u00a0(Deputy High Court Judge Philip Marshall QC).\\nWhat is meant by being demonstrable \\u2018without extensive investigation\\u2019 may depend on the context. Unless the contract makes it clear that only the certificate can be considered, extrinsic evidence will be admissible\\u2014see\\u00a0Amey Birmingham\\u00a0at para 87. Although it may not be necessary to be able to demonstrate the error immediately, in most cases this will need to be done readily \\u2013 ie by an investigation limited in both time and extent. In so far as the decision of the Court of Appeal in\\u00a0North Shore Ventures Ltd v Anstead Holdings Inc [2012] Ch 31\\u00a0suggests otherwise, I agree with Flaux J's observation in\\u00a0ABM\\u00a0Amro Commercial Finance plc v McGinn [2014] 2 Lloyd's Rep 333, at paras 51\\u201352\\u0431\\u00a0that it \\u2018has to be viewed with some circumspection\\u2019 and that on any view it cannot depend on \\u2018a full blown trial\\u2019.\\nIt is therefore clear that the permitted defences of \\u2018manifest or mathematical error or fraud\\u2019 are indeed narrow. An arguable error will not suffice, however well founded the allegation of error may ultimately prove to be\\u201d.\\nThe \\u2018manifest error\\u2019 exception in expert dispute resolution clauses\\nAs Lord Hamblen JSC observed at [30], the precise meaning of \\u201cmanifest error\\u201d depends on the particular contract and the context in which it is used; likewise, the degree of investigation which is permissible to demonstrate the error.  One context of particular relevance to the instant claim is where contracting parties agree that in the event a dispute arises between them, they will remit that dispute for resolution to an expert (acting as such and not as an arbitrator). In such circumstances, and as happened here, the parties usually agree that the expert shall give reasons for the conclusions he or she has reached.\\nThe parties were agreed that I should consider the decision of Thomas J in Invensys plc v Automotive Sealing Systems Ltd [2002] 1 All ER (Comm) 222.  In that case, Thomas J held at [17]:\\n\\u201cIn construing the present terms of reference to the Expert in this case, although it is clear that the parties desired finality, they provided for the exception of \\u2018manifest error\\u2019 in a determination which was to contain reasons. Therefore, although very substantial weight must be given to the parties\\u2019 desire to obtain finality, they must have contemplated an examination of the reasoning of the determination to see if it disclosed any manifest error\\u201d\\nThomas J went on in that case to consider what material he could consider when examining the reasoning of the expert.  At [21] to [22], he held as follows:\\nIt seems to me that in deciding whether there was a manifest error, then it is permissible to refer to documents expressly referred to in the determination and forming an essential part of the determination. As the Expert's conclusion concerns the interpretation of that agreement, it is difficult to see how the reasoning can be examined without reference to the whole of that agreement; it is common place in an appeal on a question of law under the\\u00a0Arbitration Act 1996\\u00a0which revolves on the interpretation of a contract to look at the whole of the contract, even if only a clause or two is expressly referred to in the Award; that is because in interpreting a clause of an agreement, the clause has to be interpreted in the context of the agreement as a whole. It therefore seems to me permissible, in considering whether there is a manifest error in the determination, to have regard to the terms of the original agreement. For similar reasons it seems to me that it is also permissible to examine the submissions expressly referred to; an essential part of the determination was based upon the Expert's understanding of the submissions and in the further reasons the Expert has expressly referred to certain paragraphs. As it is not possible to determine whether there was a manifest error without examining those further paragraphs to which the Expert has made specific reference, I consider that it is permissible to examine them.\\nThus, construing this particular agreement for an expert determination where the parties have provided for a reasoned determination which is to be final and binding save for manifest error, it is in my judgment permissible to examine the additional materials that form an essential part of those reasons. However it is important, as was said in\\u00a0Toepfer v Continental Grain, to stress that finality is an important factor; that it is not enough that the Expert has made a mistake; there must be a manifest or plain and obvious error. The effect of the word \\u2018manifest\\u2019 must not be diluted; the finality of the determination must not be subject to attack because another view could, in the light of further argument, properly be taken of the matters dealt with during the determination. It must be proved by the party disputing the determination that there was a manifest error in the determination\\u201d.\\nThe parties prepared a bundle for this hearing containing a range of material, some of which must have been before the expert: I note, in this connection, that in the skeleton arguments the parties prepared for the oral hearing before the expert there are references to documents in a bundle.  I do not have a copy of that bundle. There was also an agreed attendance note of the hearing, which, although clearly not a transcript, gave a sense of what oral submissions were made to the expert.  I have proceeded on the basis indicated by Thomas J in Invensys and in Parts 3 and 4 of this judgment I have taken into account:\\nThe Agreement;\\nThe written submissions made to the expert;\\nThe agreed attendance note of oral submissions made to the expert;\\nThe expert\\u2019s written determination;\\nSuch documents as are mentioned in (ii), (iii) and (iv) above.\\nHaving regard to the guidance in Sara & Hossein Asset Holdings and Invensys, in my judgment my consideration of these materials cannot amount to impermissible \\u201cextensive\\u201d investigation: it is, rather, investigation of the type that the parties must be taken to have agreed could take place in the event that one of them challenged the outcome of a reasoned expert determination on the basis that it contained a manifest error.  It is also relevant, in my judgment, that there was no possible remedy for an aggrieved party other than by challenging a determination on the ground of manifest error or fraud: a fairly thorough examination of the expert\\u2019s determination is consistent with the fact that this would be the one and only chance of avoiding its consequences if they were indeed affected by error.\\nThe Court\\u2019s task\\nAt first glance, it might be thought that the court\\u2019s task when addressing WHH\\u2019s challenge in this case is in substance no different to the determination of an appeal: the court has all the material before the expert; it has his reasoned determination; and, given the expert was a very experienced commercial barrister, the determination under challenge looks similar to a judgment.  For all these superficial similarities to the determination of an appeal, however, that is not the court\\u2019s task.  Rather, the position is as follows:\\nThe expert was not sitting as an arbitrator and there can be no appeal from his decision;\\nOn the contrary, the parties have agreed to be bound by the expert\\u2019s determination \\u201cin the absence of manifest error\\u201d;\\nWHH has asserted to E20 that it is not bound by the expert\\u2019s determination because, it contends, there are manifest errors in that determination;\\nIt is not the court\\u2019s role to decide that the expert erred in law.  Even if the court might reach a different conclusion to the expert on a legal question, that does not automatically lead to the conclusion that the expert\\u2019s determination contained a manifest error: Walton Homes Ltd v Staffordshire County Council [2013] EWHC 2554 (Ch), [2014] 1 P&CR 10, per Peter Smith J at [46].\\nAs Mr Adrian Beltrami QC, sitting as a deputy high court judge, held in Flowgroup at [32], there is no reason why, when an expert has been retained to make a determination on matters of contractual interpretation, the party challenging that determination should not have to satisfy what Mr Beltrami QC called \\u201cthe manifest error test\\u201d, by which he meant (judgment at [18]) the definition given by Simon Brown LJ in Veba.\\nIn short, the court\\u2019s role is to decide if WHH has proved the manifest errors it contends for.  As Thomas J put it in Invensys at [48]:\\n\\u201cIt is not enough for the purchasers to show that their interpretation of the agreement is right; they have to show that the Expert\\u2019s interpretation of the agreement was obviously wrong\\u201d\\nHaving set out the framework for resolving the issue before me, I now turn to the dispute between the parties and how the expert resolved it.\\nPart 3: the dispute and how the expert resolved it\\nClauses 20 and 21 of the Agreement\\nClause 20 of the Agreement is titled \\u201cUsage fee for the Stadium and Other Payments\\u201d.  It comprises twenty sub-clauses of which only the following are relevant for present purposes.  In the quotations from the Agreement which follow, I have replaced the words \\u201cConcessionaire\\u201d and \\u201cGrantor\\u201d with \\u201cWHH\\u201d and \\u201cE20\\u201d respectively.\\n[WHH] must notify [E20] of any Qualifying Transaction and, (except for an Excluded Transaction) on the request of [E20] provide all the Relevant Information and information required to accurately calculate\\u2026 the Distributions.\\nSubject to Clauses 20.12 and 20.13\\u2026, if the Adjusted Consideration is equal to, or greater than, the Threshold Amount, [WHH] shall, in respect of payments of Adjusted Consideration payable on or about the date of the Qualifying Transaction, on, or before, the date falling 30 days after the date of the Qualifying Transaction, pay to [E20] an amount equal to the Stadium Premium Amount.\\nIf any Adjusted Consideration is payable after the date of the Qualifying Transaction, the obligation to pay any further Stadium Premium Amounts in respect of a Qualifying Transaction will arise on the date falling 30 days after payment of the relevant Adjusted Consideration\\u201d.\\n[of no application in this case]\\nThe calculations set out in Clauses 20.10 to 20.13 shall be made in a manner that is consistent with the examples set out in paragraph two to three of Schedule 15 (Example calculations)\\u201d.\\nClause 1 of the Agreement contained 27 pages of defined terms used within the Agreement.  The definitions in themselves often contained references to other defined terms.

The key features of the Option for present purposes were as follows.\\nMr Sullivan granted put and call options to 1890 Holdings in relation to all the shares in WHH owned by him and by The Sullivan Trust: 1,022 ordinary shares.\\nClause 2 of the Option provided as follows:\\nIn consideration of the mutual obligations and undertakings in this agreement:\\nand in consideration for payment, by 1890s holdings, of the sum of \\u00a318,000,000\\u2026 in cash and in full to [Mr Sullivan] (which payment will be made simultaneously with 1890s holdings becoming (i) the legal and beneficial owner of 688 ordinary shares of \\u00a31.00 each in the capital of [WHH] by means of the increase of the registered capital of [WHH]; and (ii) the beneficial and, subject only to stamping, legal owner of 240 ordinary shares of \\u00a31.00 each in the capital of [WHH] by means of purchase of the shares from certain of the current shareholders of [WHH]) [Mr Sullivan] grants to 1890s holdings an option, exercisable by the [sic] 1890s holdings under this clause 2, to acquire all (not only some) of the Call Option Shares from [Mr Sullivan] on the terms of this agreement; and\\n1890s holdings grants to the Put Option Sellers [effectively, Mr Sullivan] an option, exercisable by the Put Option Sellers under this clause 2, to require 1890s holdings to buy all (not only some) of the Put Option Shares from the Put Option Sellers on the terms of this agreement\\u201d\\nMr Sullivan was entitled to keep the \\u00a318,000,000 option fee whether or not the put or call option was exercised.\\nThe call option had to be exercised by 1890 Holdings before the end of 25 March 2022. The consideration payable on exercise of the call option was simply stated at one number: \\u00a3282,000,000.  The \\u00a318,000,000 option fee formed no part of any consideration that might be payable under the call option.\\nThe put option had to be exercised within the period of one year commencing with the date upon which (putting matters simply) 1890 Holdings acquired a controlling interest in WHH. The consideration payable on exercise of the put option by Mr Sullivan was to be calculated by a formula expressed in Schedule 1 to the Option.  The formula contains a number of permutations founded on different factual assumptions: until and unless the put option is exercised, it will not be possible to know precisely what the consideration due will be.  The \\u00a318,000,000 option fee forms no part of any consideration that might later be payable.\\nThe call option was not exercised before the end of 25 March 2022 and thus lapsed after that date.\\nThe dispute\\nThe expert was sent, among other things, two documents which look like statements of case: E20 styled itself \\u201cclaimant\\u201d and produced a \\u201cStatement of Claim\\u201d and WHH styled itself \\u201cdefendant\\u201d and produced a \\u201cDefence\\u201d.\\nFrom these quasi statements of case, it is clear the dispute was as follows:\\nWHH accepted that a Stadium Premium Amount was payable in relation to the three share sales by Mr Sullivan and Mr Gold. It had provided the Relevant Information to E20 along with a spreadsheet which processed the numbers from the Relevant Information and identified a Stadium Premium Amount due in respect of the three share sales.\\nThe three share sales were treated by WHH in the spreadsheet as being effectively one transaction.\\nE20 asserted that the three share sales formed part of a single Qualifying Transaction together with the Option.\\nWHH asserted that the Option constituted a different Qualifying Transaction to the share sales.\\nThe practical effect of the two different approaches is best illustrated by reference to the calculations prepared by each party, which were before the expert and were before me.\\nIt is convenient first to run through the calculation of the Stadium Premium Amount due on the three share sales. The parties prepared figures which aggregated these three transactions, but whether these are viewed as three separate Qualifying Transactions or one single Qualifying Transactions makes no difference, as will be seen below.\\nThe calculation of the Stadium Premium Amount for the three share sales follows the following steps:\\n240 shares were sold to 1890 Holdings, but of those only 187 were sold by Relevant Shareholders: 84 by Mr Sullivan, 103 by Mr Gold (in two tranches of 3 and 100).\\nAll 187 shares were sold for the same price: \\u00a3138,162 per share.  Thus, the total price paid for the 187 shares was \\u00a325,836,294.\\nThe parties were agreed that the sale of these shares amounted to a disposal by the Relevant Shareholders of an indirect interest in the Club, because the Club was wholly owned by WHH.\\nAssume all three sales fall to be treated as one transaction. The Consideration for the sales is that provided for in sub-clause (b) of the definition of Consideration: \\u2018if 100% of the share capital in the Club is not sold in that Qualifying Transaction, an extrapolation of the value of 100% of the share capital in the Club on the basis of the consideration paid (or to be paid) for the percentage of the shares sold or to be sold\\u2019.\\nAfter the issue of the 688 new shares, the total number of shares in WHH was 3,438.  There are various ways of extrapolating the Consideration, i.e., notional value of 100% of WHH, of which two seem most obvious:\\n3,438 x \\u00a3138,162 = \\u00a3475,000,956\\n3,438/187 x \\u00a325,836,294 = \\u00a3475,000,956\\nTo this figure for Consideration must be added the Distributions and the Excess Loan Amounts.  There were no Distributions, and the figure for Excess Loan Amounts was \\u00a371,515.  Thus, the Adjusted Consideration was \\u00a3475,072,471.  For convenience, I refer to this figure as the \\u201cShare Sale Adjusted Consideration\\u201d.\\nClearly, the Share Sale Adjusted Consideration was greater than the Threshold Amount of \\u00a3125,000,000.\\nApplying the rules in the Agreed Percentage Amount to the values in that defined term (adjusted for RPI):\\n7.5% of the difference in the first layer (\\u00a3187,577,511 less \\u00a3125,000,000 = \\u00a362,577,511) gives \\u00a34,693,313.\\n10% of the second layer (\\u00a3250,103,348 less \\u00a3187,577,511 = \\u00a362,525,837) gives \\u00a36,252,584.\\nThe transaction(s) having taken place on a date falling between the 6th and 10th years of the Qualifying Period (i.e., between 2019 and 2023), 12.5% of the third layer (\\u00a3375,155,023 less \\u00a3250,103,348 = \\u00a3125,051,674) gives \\u00a315,631,459;\\nThe transaction(s) having taken place on a date falling between the 6th and 10th years of the Qualifying Period (i.e., between 2019 and 2023), 20% of the fourth layer (\\u00a3475,072,471 less \\u00a3375,155,023 = \\u00a399,917,448) gives \\u00a319,983,490.\\nThe sum of the percentage amounts due for each layer \\u2013 i.e., the Agreed Percentage Amount \\u2013 is \\u00a346,560,846.  I refer to this number as the \\u201cShare Sale Agreed Percentage Amount\\u201d\\nThe Stadium Premium Amount due is \\u00a346,560,846 multiplied by the ratio of A:B where A = the 187 sold shares and B = the 3,438 total number of shares: \\u00a346,560,846 *187/3,438 = \\u00a32,532,541.\\nAs is clear from the foregoing, because the calculation of \\u201cConsideration\\u201d requires the identification of a notional valuation of the entire shareholding then, as long as the price paid per share is the same in each three transactions, the Consideration figure will always be the same; and hence the Share Sale Adjusted Consideration and the Share Sale Agreed Percentage Amounts will always be the same.  When the Stadium Premium Amount is calculated, the number of \\u201cA\\u201d shares in the A:B ratio is of course different for each transaction; but the total of the three is the same:\\nFor the 84 shares, the Stadium Premium Amount is: \\u00a346,560,846 *84/3,438 = \\u00a31,137,612.29\\nFor the 3 shares, the Stadium Premium Amount is: \\u00a346,560,846 *3/3,438 = \\u00a340,629\\nFor the 100 shares, the Stadium Premium Amount is: \\u00a346,560,846 *100/3,438 = \\u00a31,354,300.\\nThe sum of the three results is \\u00a32,532,541.\\nThe question then arises, what, if any, Stadium Premium Amount is due in relation to the Option.\\nThe number of shares in relation to which an interest was sold under the Option was 1,022; the option price was \\u00a318,000,000; the call option consideration was \\u00a3282,000,000; and the put option consideration is not yet capable of being calculated.\\nThe provisions of sub-clause (c) of the definition of Consideration give the parties choices about what figure is to stand as the Consideration if sub-clause (c) applies: \\u201cif any share purchase option (or similar) in the Club is being sold in that Qualifying Transaction, an extrapolation of the value of 100% of the share capital in the Club on the basis of the consideration paid (or to be paid) for the shares sold [or] the consideration to be paid for the share purchase option (or similar)\\u201d.  Given that at the time the parties were considering this question, the call option had lapsed and the put option had not been exercised, the only choice available was an extrapolation of the notional value of WHH on the basis of the consideration to be paid for the Option, i.e., \\u00a318,000,000.\\nThe Stadium Premium Amount was thus to be derived from a calculation of the Consideration on the basis of the price paid for the Option, i.e., \\u00a318,000,000:\\nThe number of shares in relation to which an interest was being sold was 1,022.  The consideration payable for the option in relation to each share was thus \\u00a318,000,000/ 1,022 = \\u00a317,612.52\\nThe Consideration, i.e., notional value of 100% of WHH, would (using the same calculation performed by the parties) thus be 3,438/1022 x \\u00a318,000,000 = \\u00a360,551,859.\\nThe parties treated the Distributions and Excess Loan Amounts as having already been accounted for in relation to the shares sales.  There was thus no need to add a figure for Distribution or Excess Loan Amounts; and so the Adjusted Consideration was unchanged from the Consideration: \\u00a360,551,859.\\nFor convenience, I describe this figure of \\u00a360,551,859 as \\u201cthe Option Adjusted Consideration\\u201d.\\n\\u00a360,551,859 is clearly below the Threshold Amount.  WHH accordingly maintained that no Stadium Premium Amount can be due in relation to the fee paid for the Option.\\nE20, by contrast, contended that since, on its case, there is only one Qualifying Transaction, so therefore the Option Adjusted Consideration figure should be simply added on to the Share Sale Adjusted Consideration from the sale of the shares. If that is done, then the there is an additional \\u00a360,551,859 which falls above the uppermost band (post indexation) of \\u00a3375,155,023.\\nE20 then performed the following mathematical operations:\\nOn the basis that the Option Adjusted Consideration of \\u00a360,551,859 was being assessed for Agreed Percentage Amount as if it fell above the uppermost band, E20 calculated 20% of \\u00a360,551,859.  That operation produced a figure of \\u00a312,110,372.  I refer to this figure as the \\u201cOption Agreed Percentage Amount\\u201d.\\nThen E20 performed the calculations required to arrive at the Stadium Premium Amount, which, it will be recalled, were to take the Option Agreed Percentage Amount and multiply it by the ratio of A:B, where B is \\u201cthe total issued shareholding in the Club\\u201d.  E20 took as the value for A the 1,022 shares to which the Option agreement related; and for B it took the 3,438 total number of shares.\\nThe input figure that E20 used for this calculation was \\u00a312,110,372.  Thus, \\u00a312,110,372 *1,022/3,438 = \\u00a33,600,000.\\nIt is convenient at this point to draw attention to the fact that what E20\\u2019s calculation involved was arriving at one single figure for Stadium Premium Amount by performing two separate calculations:\\nThe set of calculations to arrive at the component of E20\\u2019s blended figure which was derived from the Share Sale Adjusted Consideration was based on a sale price per share of \\u00a3138,162 and on 187 shares being sold out of 3,438 shares in WHH;\\nThe set of calculations to arrive at the component of E20\\u2019s blended figure which was derived from the Option Adjusted Consideration was based on an option price per share of \\u00a317,612.52 and on the option being granted in relation to 1,022 shares out of 3,438 shares in WHH.\\nWhat E20 did not do was:\\nCalculate the figure for the Share Sale Adjusted Consideration (\\u00a3475,072,471);\\nAdd to it the figure for the Option Adjusted Consideration (\\u00a360,551,859);\\nCalculate from the resulting number (\\u00a3535,624,330) what the Agreed Percentage Amount would be (it would be \\u00a358,671,218);\\nProrate that Agreed Percentage Amount to find the Stadium Premium Amount.  E20 could not perform this final stage because there is no way of discerning a value for A to use in the formula provided for calculating the Stadium Premium Amount: one cannot use 187 shares or 1,022 shares, and there is no other value that can be used for A.\\nThe expert determination\\nAs already stated, the expert was appointed to act as an expert, not an arbitrator.  The parties agreed before me that whatever might have been submitted to the expert, his role remained to come to a determination that was free from manifest error. That being the case, I do not consider it necessary to rehearse the submissions made to the expert: what matters for present purposes is the result, not the process by which it was reached.  Furthermore, the arguments made before the expert were substantially repeated before me in the context of WHH\\u2019s case that the expert determination contains a manifest error, and I address them below when considering that question.\\nThe expert\\u2019s determination is dated 12 February 2023.  Over paras 1 to 12, he reviewed the background of the share sales and calculation of the Stadium Premium Amount payable in relation to them and set out the salient facts regarding the Option.  Between paras 13 to 24 he set out Clauses 20.10 to 20.14 of the Agreement and the defined terms used within those sub-clauses. Between paras 25 and 36 he set out the issue between the parties, the applicable principles of construction, and the arguments made by E20 and WHH respectively.\\nAt paragraph 37 he gave his determination:\\n\\u201cI determine that in the context of the Agreement and the purpose of any provision for the payment of the Stadium Premium Account, the expression \\u2018any\\u2019 in Qualifying Transaction is to be construed as \\u2018one or more\\u2019 and not \\u2018one\\u2019 as the intention of the parties was to bring a broad range of actions within the ambit of a Qualifying Transaction.  Accordingly, the expression Transaction can embrace one or more of the factors described in the description of Qualifying Transaction.  Further the sale of the 187 shares and the grant of the Option are to be regarded as being part of the same transaction and hence the same Qualifying Transaction. The fact that there were three Relevant Shareholders selling shares to 1890 [Holdings] and only one of the Relevant Shareholders was a party to the Option Agreement (with an additional party to the Option Agreement as a guarantor) does not prevent the sale of the 187 shares and the Option Agreement falling within the expression Qualifying Transaction as the sale of the 187 shares and the Option Agreement were part of the same deal or arrangement.  Furthermore, the definition of Consideration in relation to a Qualifying Transaction requires the application of (a), (b) or (c) to each component of a Qualified [sic] Transaction if there are more than one and, in this case, requires the application of (b) and (c) so that the Additional Premium Amount must be aggregated with the Additional Premium Amount paid in respect of the 187 shares\\u201d\\nThe outcome of the expert\\u2019s determination was that WHH was found liable to pay \\u00a33,600,000 to E20, as well as E20\\u2019s costs of the reference to the expert.\\nPart 4: did the determination contain \\u201cmanifest errors\\u201d?\\nWHH\\u2019s complaint in these Part 8 proceedings is that the determination set out above contains two manifest errors.  The way WHH pleaded these errors was as follows:\\n\\u201cThe Expert has accepted E20\\u2019s calculation of the Stadium Premium Amount which was arrived at by applying the percentage scale (in the definition of Agreed Percentage Amount) to a figure for the Adjusted Consideration which is contrary to the definition at clause 1.1 of the [Agreement], which requires an Adjusted Consideration to be calculation [sic] by reference to the Consideration for the option\\u201d\\n\\u201cThe Expert has found that the four agreements (ie three sale and one option) constituted a single \\u2018transaction\\u2019 notwithstanding that they were between different parties and there was no agreement to which all of the participants were parties.  Where two agreements are between different parties they cannot as a matter of ordinary English be a single transaction. This finding was also contrary to the definition of Qualifying Transaction and Consideration which necessitated the sale and the option being treated as different Qualifying Transactions\\u201d.\\nThe First Complaint\\nThe first complaint is expressed in the Part 8 Details of Claim at a relatively high level of abstraction and needs some unpacking.  Mr Downes clarified in his written and oral submissions that the gravamen of the complaint was that E20\\u2019s calculation applied the percentage scale to two extrapolated 100% valuations of WHH.  By this, he was referring to the point identified above at paragraphs 57 and 58.\\nI have set out above the definition of Consideration in the Agreement, but will do so again in full here:\\n\\u201cConsideration means, for a Qualifying Transaction:\\nthe amount paid or to be paid by a purchaser in that Qualifying Transaction for 100% of the share capital in the Club (to be calculated net of legal and advisory costs (but only to the extent that they are reasonable) incurred in relation to the Qualifying Transaction);\\nif 100% of the share capital in the Club is not sold in that Qualifying Transaction, an extrapolation of the value of 100% of the share capital in the Club on the basis of the consideration paid (or to be paid) for the percentage of the shares sold or to be sold; or\\nif any share purchase option (or similar) in the Club is being sold in that Qualifying Transaction, an extrapolation of the value of 100% of the share capital in the Club on the basis of the consideration paid (or to be paid) for the shares sold [or] the consideration to be paid for the share purchase option (or similar)\\u201d\\nThe definition self-evidently covers three alternative transaction types: (a), (b), (c).  The use of the disjunctive \\u201cor\\u201d shows that Consideration may mean one of three things in relation to any given Qualifying Transaction.  There is nothing in the wording of the definition that indicates that Consideration may mean any one or more of the three alternatives for any given Qualifying Transaction.\\nThat being so, E20\\u2019s approach to determining the Stadium Premium Amount by undertaking two separate calculations, each on a different basis, but then blending them into a hybrid calculation, can only be justified if there are words elsewhere in the Agreement that justify such an approach.\\nAs Mr Plewman fairly accepted on behalf of E20, there are no express words that compel this approach. E20\\u2019s case was that if a transaction may be a series of linked transactions, then it must follow in the circumstances here that the Consideration can comprise calculations performed under both sub-clause (b) and (c) of the definition. In this connection, Mr Plewman placed particular emphasis on the contention that Clauses 20.10 to 20.14 were anti-embarrassment provisions: his point was that it must be right that E20 could capture a fair portion of the entirety of the value realised by the Relevant Shareholders from the series of transactions which took place on 10 November 2021.\\nMr Plewman also referred to the provisions of Schedule 15 to the Agreement, referred to in Clause 20.14. Schedule 15 contains sample calculations of Stadium Premium Amount, but none of the samples illustrates a situation where a Relevant Shareholder has in the course of one transaction sold some shares and granted an option in relation to other shares.\\nIn my judgment, the fundamental difficulty with E20\\u2019s approach is that it requires treating the calculation of the Share Sale Adjusted Consideration and the Option Adjusted Consideration as in some respects linked and in other respects separate.\\nThe Share Sale Adjusted Consideration (\\u00a3475,072,471) is the product of a calculation based on the sale of 187 shares, i.e., 5.44% of the total number of shares in WHH.\\nThe Option Adjusted Consideration (\\u00a360,551,859) is the product of a calculation based on the granting of option in relation to 1,022 shares, i.e., 29.72% of the total number of shares in WHH.\\nThe bases of the two Adjusted Consideration figures are thus different: they give notional valuations for the 100% shareholding of two conceptually separate notions.  The Share Sale Adjusted Consideration leads to a notional valuation of the entire shareholding of WHH on the assumption that every share had the same value as the 187 that were sold.  The Option Adjusted Consideration leads to a notional valuation of the entire shareholding of WHH on the assumption that every share, were it subject to the Option, would have the same value as the 1,022 shares which were subject to the Option.\\nTo add the Option Adjusted Consideration to the Share Sale Adjusted Consideration is to give an Adjusted Consideration for a transaction which never took place.\\nI cannot, accordingly, see any basis in the Agreement to arrive at the blended valuation for which E20 contended and which the expert accepted. In my judgment, the expert was in error in this respect.  That is not, however, the end of the matter, because even if the expert was in error, WHH must still prove that the error was one that should be characterised as \\u201cmanifest\\u201d.  I return to this below after considering WHH\\u2019s second complaint.\\nThe Second Complaint\\nWHH\\u2019s complaint is simply stated:\\nWhere a series of transactions take place with different counterparties in each transaction, then that series of transactions cannot, as a matter of the ordinary usage of the English language, be termed a single transaction.\\nAs a matter of construction of the Agreement, the definitions of Qualifying Transaction and Consideration cannot be reconciled with the proposition that a series of transactions could be treated as a single Qualifying Transaction.\\nI have no hesitation in rejecting the first of these contentions.  Whether a series of linked transactions may be termed a single transaction will depend on each case on the nature of the transactions. The sale by a holding company\\u2019s shareholders of their entire interest to another company can often involve many transactions covering off the position of subsidiary companies; on one level, each such transaction is a single transaction, but the sum of the parts may, without doing any violence to language, be termed a single transaction: \\u201cthe day we sold the company\\u201d. Accordingly, I do not consider that the expert can be said to have fallen into error as alleged in this first part of the second complaint.\\nOn the construction point, Mr Downes submitted as follows:\\nClause 20.11 refers to \\u201cthe\\u201d Adjusted Consideration and \\u201cthe\\u201d Stadium Premium Amount\\u201d.\\nThe definition of Consideration provides that Consideration means \\u201cfor a Qualifying Transaction\\u201d (singular) one of the definitions in sub-clauses (a), (b) or (c);\\nWithin the sub-clauses of the definition of Consideration:\\nSub-clause (a) provides that in the circumstances provided in that sub-clause, Consideration means \\u201cthe amount paid or to be paid by a purchaser in that Qualifying Transaction\\u201d\\nSub-clause (b) provides that in the circumstances provided in that sub-clause, Consideration means an extrapolation on the basis of \\u201cthe consideration paid\\u201d\\u2026\\nSub-clause (c) provides that in the circumstances provided in that sub-clause, Consideration means an extrapolation on the basis of \\u201cthe consideration paid\\u201d.\\nThe Adjusted Consideration is calculated by reference to a single figure (i.e., the Consideration);\\nThe Agreed Percentage Amount is to be calculated by reference to one Adjusted Consideration figure; and\\nStadium Premium Amount is calculated by applying a single ratio to the Agreed Percentage Amount.\\nMr Plewman resisted this on the basis that:\\nBy Clause 1.4(a) of the Agreement, \\u201c(save where the context requires otherwise)\\u2026 the singular number shall include the plural and vice versa\\u201d;\\nThe word \\u201ctransaction\\u201d is not a defined term.  Thus, the definition of Qualifying Transaction is that it means \\u201cany sale or transfer of any interest in the Club (directly or indirectly)\\u2026 or any transaction having the same or substantially similar effect\\u201d; and a series of linked agreements could constitute a \\u201ctransaction having the\\u201d effect of being a sale or transfer of any interest in the Club.\\nThe expert\\u2019s reasoning for his determination on this question was as follows:\\n\\u201cI consider that the function of (a) (b) and (c) of the definition of Consideration is to describe how the consideration is to be calculated according to the different forms a transaction might take (100 per cent, less than 100 per cent or the grant of an option which might lead to a sale if it is exercised or a combination of (a) (with an option to call on the seller to buy back shares) (b) or (c)) and does not assist the exercise of interpreting the expression Qualifying Transaction.  The definition of Consideration does not lead to the conclusion that an option to purchase other shares in an agreement or arrangement to sell share [sic] must be treated as a separate Qualifying Transaction\\u2026\\nWHHL also submitted that the extrapolation of the value of 100 per cent of the share capital in the Club in the case of a sale of less than 100 per cent of the shares combined with the sale of an option might result in a value being reached in excess of the value of 100 per cent of the shares in the Club.  That might well appear to be the case when one aggregates the two values obtained in relation to the sale of the shares and the grant of the option in order to calculate the Consideration in accordance with the formula in the definition of Consideration but that is inherent in the formula and would, for example, apply where an option was granted for 95 per cent of the shares and exercised (an example where WHHL agrees that the consideration would include the option price and the strike price).  If the option was granted at a substantial price and the strike price was the true market value of the shares the formula for the Agreed Percentage Amount might give rise to a price which might well exceed the value of 100 per cent of the value of the share capital of the Club and that it [sic] is because two events have occurred in relation to the 95 per cent of the shares, (i) the grant of an option over the shares and (2) [sic, sc. \\u201c(ii)\\u201d] a sale of the shares; i.e. two separate interests in the same shares have been disposed of.  Furthermore, the reference to the value of 100 per cent of the shares in (b) and (c) is not a reference to their true market value but a value derived from \\u2018the basis of the consideration paid (or to be paid) for the shares\\u2019 which might bear no relation to the true value of the shares but is entirely dependent upon the subjective assessment of the parties to the sale or option as to what price they are prepared to pay.\\u201d\\nI have already held above that the expert\\u2019s acceptance of E20\\u2019s calculation of the blended Stadium Premium Amount was erroneous; to the extent the expert\\u2019s reasoning in relation to whether two or more transactions can be treated as one Qualifying Transaction relies on the analysis that underpinned E20\\u2019s calculations, then in my judgment, his reasoning on that point too is undermined.\\nFurthermore, I consider that E20\\u2019s own approach to calculating the Stadium Premium Amount in this case in fact recognises that the share sales and the Option are indeed separate transactions.  As discussed above, E20\\u2019s calculation involves pro-rating the Stadium Premium Amount due on the share sales on a different basis to the amount due on the Option.  Even if one could say that the share sales and the Option should be categorised together as one Qualifying Transaction, it is not possible to proceed from there to the calculation of one Stadium Premium Amount using any mechanism contained within the Agreement.\\nAccordingly, in my judgment WHH has proved that the expert fell into error in his determination that the share sales and the Option fall to be characterised as one Qualifying Transaction with the result that the amount calculated by E20 falls due for payment by WHH.\\nWere the errors of the expert \\u201cmanifest errors\\u201d?\\nMr Plewman submitted on behalf of E20 that even if the expert had been wrong in his construction of the Agreement, his errors cannot be said to have been \\u201cmanifest\\u201d. A manifest error, Mr Plewman said, was \\u201ca howler\\u201d, something that \\u201chit you between the eyes\\u201d, \\u201cso obvious a blunder that there really can be no dispute about it\\u201d.  There is support for Mr Plewman\\u2019s submissions in dicta from the authorities: Simon Brown LJ in Veba referred to \\u201coversights and blunders\\u201d, and his remarks have been cited with approval by Lord Hamblen JSC in Sara & Hossein Asset Holdings Ltd; the suggested synonym of a \\u201chowler\\u201d came from submissions made to Mr Beltrami QC in Flowgroup, which Mr Beltrami did not disagree with.  It is, however, relevant to recall that Lord Hamblen JSC also referred to the guidance given by Lewison J (as he then was) in Van der Merwe (followed by the Court of Appeal in that case and in Amey Birmingham Highways): \\u201cA \\u2018manifest error\\u2019 is one that is obvious or easily demonstrable without extensive investigation.\\u201d\\nI am not persuaded that a party asserting that a reasoned expert determination which involves a point of contractual construction is obliged to prove that the expert has committed a \\u201cblunder\\u201d, let alone that such a party must prove that an expert has committed a \\u201chowler\\u201d (whatever the correct definition of that is).  I do not see how this terminology, with its pejorative overtones, can give a guide to the necessary qualities of an error in a reasoned determination.  It may very well be that some errors can properly be characterised as blunders or even howlers; but ultimately, such errors would only be one subset of the whole range of errors that could be made.\\nFurthermore, for me to decide whether an error is to be labelled a \\u201cblunder\\u201d or \\u201chowler\\u201d would involve the application of almost purely subjective judgment.  It would also inevitably involve casting aspersions on the expert\\u2019s approach which are unfair (since he is not present) and probably do no party any good, especially where, as here, the expert has complete immunity from suit in relation to anything he has done.\\nAccordingly, rather than express myself in terms which I consider unhelpful in the context of a challenge to a reasoned determination involving a question of contractual interpretation, in my judgment it is safer to focus on the Van der Merwe guidance read together the Veba guidance: to be \\u201cmanifest\\u201d, errors must be so obvious\\u00a0and obviously capable of affecting the determination\\u00a0as to admit of no difference of opinion.\\nIn my judgment, the errors which I have found proved by WHH are obvious, and are obviously capable of affecting the determination, because:\\nThe expert\\u2019s error in adopting the blended calculation proffered by E20 was that he simply misread the word \\u201cor\\u201d in the definition of Consideration to mean \\u201cand\\u201d.  I asked Mr Plewman if reading the word \\u201cor\\u201d to mean \\u201cand\\u201d could amount to a manifest error.  He fairly accepted that it could but insisted that in the instant case the position was \\u201cmuch more complex\\u201d.  He said that in order for E20 to capture some of the value of the \\u00a318,000,000 option fee, it must be the case that \\u201cor\\u201d in the definition of Consideration should effectively be read as \\u201cand\\u201d.  In my judgment, however, there is nothing complex here that requires the drastic step of mutating a disjunctive word into a conjunctive one.  Mr Plewman\\u2019s concession was right and is apt here because, putting matters simply, the error would have been avoided entirely if the expert had accepted that \\u201cor\\u201d meant what it said.\\nThe blending of the Share Sale Adjusted Consideration and the Option Adjusted Consideration, followed by the calculation of the Stadium Premium Amount by using two different values for \\u201cA\\u201d in the formula was, in my judgment, an impossible step having regard to the rules contained in the Agreement for the calculation of Stadium Premium Amount.  In my judgment, in accepting E20\\u2019s calculation as correct, the expert committed an error which was obvious: it can be seen from the Agreement that E20\\u2019s calculation has no basis in the rules.\\nIf the errors I have found were not made, then the result of the expert determination would have been that E20\\u2019s claim to \\u00a33,600,000 would have been rejected and WHH would not have been ordered to pay E20\\u2019s costs.  The errors went to the heart of the expert\\u2019s determination.\\nAs to whether these obvious errors, which obviously affect the outcome of the determination, are such as admit no difference of opinion:\\nThere is before me clearly a difference of opinion in one sense, in that Mr Plewman\\u2019s submissions are predicated on the contention that the expert\\u2019s determination was correct. In my judgment, however, Mr Plewman\\u2019s skilful advocacy cannot be said to represent his opinion, and I decline to treat it as such.\\nIn my judgment, the errors I have identified are such as are unlikely to admit any difference of opinion: the reasoning above involves applying the words of the Agreement and doing the mathematics, not exercising fine judgment in relation to a difficult argument regarding construction.  In that respect, I reject a contention made in E20\\u2019s written evidence for these proceedings that the Agreement was \\u201cpoorly drafted and ambiguous\\u201d and that the expert had reached a reasonable construction; in my judgment, the provisions of the Agreement which I have had to consider are admirably clear.\\nPart 5: conclusion\\nFor the reasons given above, in my judgment WHH has proved that the expert determination in this case contains two manifest errors.  Accordingly, I shall grant the declaration sought by WHH that the determination is not final and binding on WHH.\\nI invite the parties to seek to agree a form of order reflecting the effect of my judgment and any other matters including costs.  If agreement cannot be reached, I will direct that a short further hearing be listed to deal with consequential matters.\\n(Footnote reference from: 1)  In the Agreement, the word \\u201cof\\u201d appears here, but the parties were agreed that this was a typographical error for \\u201cor\\u201d.\\n[2025] EWHC 140 (Comm)\\nThe original format of the judgment as handed down by the court, for printing and downloading.\\nThe judgment in machine-readable LegalDocML format for developers, data scientists and researchers.\\nAll content is available under the Open Justice Licence.\\n        \\n        For re-use that is not covered by the Open Justice Licence, please apply for licence to do computational analysis..\",\n          \"Judgments and decisions from 2001 onwards\\n[2025] EWCA Civ 41\\nON APPEAL FROM THE HIGH COURT OF JUSTICE\\nKING\\u2019S BENCH DIVISION\\nADMINISTRATIVE COURT\\nMrs Justice Cockerill\\nRoyal Courts of Justice\\nStrand, London, WC2A 2LL\\nBefore :\\nLORD JUSTICE UNDERHILL\\n(Vice-President of the Court of Appeal (Civil Division))\\nLORD JUSTICE SINGHand\\nLORD JUSTICE DINGEMANS\\nBetween :\\nANZHELIKA KHAN\\nAppellant\\n- and -\\nSECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN, COMMONWEALTH AND DEVELOPMENT AFFAIRS\\nRespondent\\nClare Montgomery KC and Tim James-Matthews (instructed by Enyo Law LLP) for the Appellant\\nDavid Blundell KC, Catherine Brown and Femi Adekoya (instructed by the Treasury Solicitor) for the Respondent\\nHearing dates: 12 and 13 November 2024\\nApproved Judgment\\nThis judgment was handed down remotely at 10 a.m. on Friday, 24 January 2025 by circulation to the parties or their representatives by e-mail and by release to the National Archives.\\n.............................\\nLord Justice Singh:\\nIntroduction\\nThe Appellant appeals against the order of Cockerill J (\\u201cthe Judge\\u201d), sitting in the Administrative Court, dated 20 February 2024, by which she dismissed her claim under section 38(2) of the Sanctions and Anti-Money Laundering Act 2018 (\\u201cSAMLA\\u201d).  By that claim the Appellant challenged the decision, dated 28 February 2023, of the Secretary of State for Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Affairs (\\u201cthe Secretary of State\\u201d or \\u201cthe FCDO\\u201d) to take no action with regard to (i.e. to maintain) her designation under the Russia (Sanctions) (EU Exit) Regulations (SI 2019/855) (\\u201cthe 2019 Regulations\\u201d), following a review of the original designation decision, which had been made on 21 April 2022.\\nOn 26 June 2024 permission to appeal was granted by Falk LJ on three grounds.  The Appellant requires permission to appeal on a fourth ground; that application for permission was adjourned by Falk LJ, to be considered at the substantive hearing on a \\u201crolled up\\u201d basis.\\nBefore this Court, as before the Administrative Court, there was a Confidential bundle.  It is not necessary to set out any confidential information in this judgment for the proper and fair understanding of the issues which arise on this appeal.  When summarising the factual background, I will redact the evidence in so far as it is necessary to do so in order to protect confidentiality.\\nLegislative framework\\nThe legislative framework which governs the UK sanctions regime, so far as relevant to the present case, can be summarised as follows.\\nSection 1 of SAMLA provides for the power to make sanctions regulations.  So far as material, it provides:\\nAn appropriate Minister may make sanctions regulations where that Minister considers that it is appropriate to make the regulations\\u2013\\u2013\\n\\u2026\\nfor a purpose within subsection (2).\\nA purpose is within this subsection if the appropriate Minister making the regulations considers that carrying out that purpose would\\u2014\\n\\u2026\\nbe in the interests of national security, [or]\\nbe in the interests of international peace and  security,\\n\\u2026\\u201d\\nSection 11(2) of SAMLA originally provided as follows:\\n\\u201cThe regulations must contain provision which prohibits the Minister from designating a person by name except where the Minister\\u2013\\u2013\\nhas reasonable grounds to suspect that that person is an involved person (see subsection (3)) and\\nconsiders that the designation of that person is appropriate, having regard to\\u2013\\u2013\\nthe purpose of the regulations as stated under section 1(3), and\\nthe likely significant effects of the designation on that person (as they appear  to the Minister to be on the basis of the information that the Minister has).\\u201d\\nThat provision was amended by the Economic Crime (Transparency and Enforcement) Act 2022 (\\u201cthe 2022 Act\\u201d).  Section 58(3) of the 2022 Act amended section 11(2)(b) of SAMLA to remove the requirement that regulations made under SAMLA must contain a provision prohibiting the designation of an individual unless the Minister considers (among other things) \\u201cthat the designation of that person is appropriate\\u201d.\\nSection 23 of SAMLA provides that:\\nAt any time while a relevant designation has effect, the designated person may\\u2014\\nrequest the Minister to vary the designation, or\\nrequest the Minister to revoke the designation.\\n\\u2026\\nOn a request under this section the Minister must decide whether to vary or revoke the designation or to take no action with respect to it \\u2026\\u201d\\nSection 38 of SAMLA provides that:\\nThis section applies to\\u2013\\u2013\\nany decision under section 23(3) \\u2026 (decision, following a request to or review by an appropriate Minister, on whether a designation of a person made under a designation power should be varied or revoked);\\n\\u2026\\nThe appropriate person may apply to the High Court \\u2026 for the decision to be set aside.\\n\\u2018The appropriate person\\u2019 means\\u2013\\u2013\\nin relation to a decision within subsection (1)(a),   the person named by the designation;\\n\\u2026\\nIn determining whether the decision should be set aside, the court must apply the principles applicable on an application for judicial review.\\nIf the Court decides that a decision should be set aside it may make any such order, or give any such relief, as could in the absence of this section be made or given in proceedings for judicial review of the decision; \\u2026\\u201d\\nThe 2019 Regulations were made pursuant to SAMLA.  They implement a system of sanction designation for purposes connected with Russian actions in relation to Ukraine.  As is well-known, those actions pre-date 2022, for example Crimea was annexed in 2014 and there were destabilisation operations in eastern parts of Ukraine for several years before the full-scale invasion which began on 24 February 2022.  The 2019 Regulations were made under the power conferred by section 1(1)(c) of SAMLA, read with section 1(2)(b) and (c).\\nRegulation 4 of the 2019 Regulations sets out the purposes of those Regulations as follows:\\n\\u201cThe regulations contained in this instrument that are made under section 1 of the Act are for the purposes of encouraging Russia to cease actions destabilising Ukraine or undermining or threatening the territorial integrity, sovereignty or independence of Ukraine.\\u201d\\nRegulation 5 empowers the Minister to designate persons under the 2019 Regulations.\\nRegulation 6 sets out the criteria by which that power may be exercised:\\nThe Secretary of State may not designate a person under regulation 5 \\u2026 unless the Secretary of State\\u2014\\nhas reasonable grounds to suspect that that person is  an involved person, and\\nconsiders that the designation of that person is  appropriate, having regard to\\u2014\\nthe purposes stated in regulation 4 \\u2026, and\\nthe likely significant effects of the designation on that person (as they appear to the Secretary State to be  on the basis of the information that the Secretary of  State has).\\nIn this regulation, an \\u2018involved person\\u2019 means a person who\\u2014\\nis or has been involved in\\u2014\\ndestabilising Ukraine or undermining or threatening the territorial integrity, sovereignty or independence of Ukraine, or\\nobtaining a benefit from or supporting the Government of Russia\\n\\u2026\\nis acting on behalf of or at the direction of a person  who is or has been so involved, or\\nis a member of, or associated with, a person who is or  has been so involved.\\n\\u2026\\nIn paragraph (2)(d), being \\u2018associated with\\u2019 a person includes\\u2014\\nobtaining a financial benefit or other material benefit  from that person;\\nbeing an immediate family member of that person.\\n\\u2026\\u201d\\nSection 61(3) of the 2022 Act provides that any pre-commencement regulations (which, for present purposes, include the 2019 Regulations) are deemed to have always had effect as if the Regulations do not include any provision required to be included by, among other things, section 11(2)(b) of SAMLA.  The effect of this is that regulation 6 is to be read without regulation 6(1)(b), so reflecting the amendment made to SAMLA by the 2022 Act.\\nThe consequences of designation are set out in the 2019 Regulations.  In particular:\\nIt is a criminal offence for a person to deal with funds or economic resources owned, held or controlled by a designated person, if that person knows, or has reasonable cause to suspect, that they are so dealing:  regulation 11(1).\\nIt is a criminal offence for a person to make funds or economic resources available directly or indirectly to a designated person, if that person knows, or has reasonable cause to suspect, that they are making the funds or economic resources so available:  see regulations 12(1) and 14(1).\\nIt is a criminal offence for a person to make funds or economic resources available to any other person for the benefit of a designated person, if that person knows, or has reasonable cause to suspect, that they are making funds or economic resources so available:  see regulations 13(1) and 15(1).\\nIt is a criminal offence for a person to intentionally participate in activities knowing that the object or effect of them is (whether directly or indirectly) to circumvent any of the prohibitions above, or to enable or facilitate the contravention of any such prohibition:  see regulation 19(1).\\nFactual background\\nThe Appellant is a British citizen, resident in the United Kingdom (\\u201cUK\\u201d), with primary responsibility for her family home and the care and supervision of her children, including two dependent children, who are both also British citizens.\\nThe Appellant was born on 23 June 1971 in Almaty (now in Kazakhstan) and has lived in the UK since 2013.  She became a British citizen on 29 October 2019.\\nThe Appellant met her husband, German Khan, in August 1992.  They were married in December 1994.  They have four children, born in June 1995, July 2001, July 2005 and July 2012 respectively.  The three youngest children are British citizens and are ordinarily resident in the UK.\\nIn February 2022 Russia extended its invasion of Ukraine.  This has led to sanctions against Russia being imposed by many states around the world, including the UK and the European Union (\\u201cEU\\u201d).\\nThe Appellant\\u2019s husband was designated under the UK sanctions regime on 15 March 2022.  There has been no challenge to his designation.\\nIn the High Court proceedings evidence was filed on behalf of the Respondent from David Reed, who has been the Director of Sanctions Directorate since 26 September 2022.  In his first witness statement (dated 6 July 2023), at para 71, he says that:\\n\\u201c\\u2026 I note that on 16 March 2023, 16 days after Ms Khan's request for revocation of her designation was refused, it was reported that Mr Khan attended a meeting at the Kremlin hosted by Vladimir Putin.  In this meeting, Mr Khan, alongside at least seven other individuals designated by the UK, was urged to invest in Russia\\u2019s economy to mitigate the effects of Western sanctions and was discouraged from \\u2018hiding\\u2019 assets in jurisdictions outside of Russia \\u2026 German Khan's attendance at this meeting further demonstrates that there continues to be a rational link to the objectives of the 2019 Russia Regulations because it is evidence of his ongoing association with Vladimir Putin, contrary to what has been suggested by Ms Khan.\\u201d\\nThe Appellant herself was designated on 21 April 2022 for the purposes of an asset freeze and transport sanctions under the 2019 Regulations.  She was designated on the basis that there are reasonable grounds to suspect that she is \\u201cassociated\\u201d with a person (her husband) who is, or has been, involved in obtaining a benefit from or supporting the Government of Russia, including obtaining a financial benefit from, and being an immediate family member of, that person.\\nIt is not disputed that Mr Khan is an \\u201cinvolved person\\u201d within the meaning of regulation 6(2)(a)(ii) of the 2019 Regulations, as a person obtaining a benefit from or supporting the Government of Russia.\\nThere can be no doubt that the Appellant, being the wife of Mr Khan, is an immediate family member of his and therefore falls within the definition of being a person \\u201cassociated with\\u201d him:  see regulation 6(6)(b).  In addition, the Appellant falls within the definition of \\u201cassociated with\\u201d because she has obtained a financial benefit from him:  see regulation 6(6)(a).\\nOn 22 November 2022 the Appellant requested the revocation of her designation by way of Ministerial review under section 23(1)(b) of SAMLA.  An administrative review was initiated, and her designation was amended and endorsed by the Minister on 27 February 2023.  A further submission was sent to the Minister on 28 February 2023, relating to the transport sanctions, and was endorsed by the Minister on the same date.  The final decision to maintain the designation was made by an FCDO official on 28 February 2023.\\nThe Appellant\\u2019s financial position\\nIn the Appellant\\u2019s first witness statement, dated 22 November 2022, she explains her financial assets and income.  In particular, she emphasises that her accounts are independent from her husband.\\nShe also explains the various gifts which she has received from Mr Khan.  In particular, \\u201cGift 14\\u201d was made because of the risk that he might become subject to financial sanctions.  The gift was made on 1 March 2022 (two weeks before Mr Khan was designated in the EU and the UK).  At that stage, the Appellant states, at para 65 of her first witness statement:\\n\\u201c\\u2026 We did not know whether [he] would be designated, but we understood (given previous inaccurate reporting regarding his relationship with Mr Putin), that it was possible that he may be at some stage in the future.  This was an irrevocable and unconditional gift of money from [Mr Khan] to me.  To be clear, the money received in Gift 14 is mine, and not [his].  That money was, and is, only intended to be used for my, and my children\\u2019s, needs.\\u201d\\nAppendix 1, which is annexed to the witness statement, describes each of the gifts in more detail.\\nThe consequences of the designation of the Appellant in the present case were described by the Judge, at para 68 of her judgment, as being \\u201csignificant and grave\\u201d.  The freeze on the Appellant\\u2019s assets has the effect that she is unable to deal with any of her own property, even for such basic needs as paying for food or other essential items for herself and her family.  There is, however, a scheme for licensing expenditure which is intended to mitigate the harshness of the consequences of designation.  I will return to that licensing scheme below.\\nThe Respondent\\u2019s reasons for the Appellant\\u2019s designation\\nThe original Statement of Reasons for the Appellant\\u2019s designation on 21 April 2022 stated the following:\\n\\u201cThere are reasonable grounds to suspect that Anzhelika KHAN is associated with German Borisovich KHAN.  Anzhelika KHAN is the wife of German Borisovich KHAN.  German Borisovich KHAN, hereafter KHAN, is a prominent Russian businessman.  Khan is obtaining a benefit from and/or supporting the Government of Russia through his positions on the Supervisory Board of the Alfa Group Consortium and the Board of Directors of ABH Holdings S.A., owner of Russia\\u2019s largest privately owned bank \\u2018Alfa-Bank (Russia)\\u2019, and Chairman of the Supervisory Board of A1 Investment Holdings S.A., entities which are carrying on business in sectors of strategic significance to the Government of Russia.  KHAN is also a close associate of Vladimir Putin who has been involved in destabilising Ukraine or undermining or threatening the territorial integrity, sovereignty or independence of Ukraine.\\u201d\\nIt should be noted that, before the original designation of the Appellant in April 2022, there was produced a Sanctions Designation Form, which included an assessment of the \\u201cECHR compatibility/proportionality\\u201d of the designation decision.\\nFurthermore, by the time of the administrative review decision, in February 2023, there was an Administrative Review Form produced, which took into account further evidence, including representations which had been made on behalf of the Appellant, and addressed those in some detail.  Again, the FCDO made an assessment of whether maintenance of the designation would be compatible with ECHR rights and concluded that it would.\\nAt para 24 of Mr Reed\\u2019s first witness statement, he explained the importance which the Respondent attaches to the concept of \\u201cassociation\\u201d in the following way:\\n\\u201cThe concept of association is a key pillar of the UK sanctions regime under SAMLA.  It features across all individual UK autonomous sanctions regimes.  Designations made on the basis of association with a person who is or has been involved in the activities targeted by the sanctions regime can be justified in a number of ways, one or more of which may be applicable in any given case.  This includes increasing the coercive pressure on an involved person to take actions consistent with the objective(s) of the relevant sanctions regime, by incentivising one or more of their associates to influence the involved person\\u2019s behaviour and/or to distance themselves from and thereby isolate the involved person, and this is clearly relevant in Ms Khan's case as set out in more detail in \\u00a772 below.  This effect can be amplified if the designation of an associate also incentivises other individuals who are associated with an involved person to take similar actions, or deters other individuals from becoming associated with an involved person.  Furthermore, given the widespread practice of designated persons holding assets via their associates - for example, properties held in the names of family members - as a means of seeking to circumvent the effect of sanctions, designations of these associates can also be critical in ensuring that the designation of the relevant involved person has its intended effect.  This point is also clearly relevant in Ms Khan's case due to the extensive financial and material benefit she has obtained from German Khan, as outlined below (see, for example, \\u00a725, \\u00a750 and \\u00a772(d)).\\u201d\\nPara 72 of Mr Reed\\u2019s witness statement, to which he refers in that passage, needs to be set out in full:\\n\\u201cThe designation of Ms Khan, which is based on her association with her husband German Khan, is also rationally connected to the purposes identified in regulation 4 of the 2019 Regulations. The designation of Ms Khan on the grounds of her association with German Khan is likely to contribute to achieving those purposes in at least the following ways:\\nDesignating Ms Khan on this basis will send a signal to Ms Khan, others in her position and the wider international community that there are negative consequences to receiving a financial or other material benefit from persons involved in obtaining a benefit or supporting the Government of Russia.  It also signals that associated persons bear some personal responsibility for the consequences of activities which have provided them (whether directly or indirectly) with financial or other material benefit.\\nThe designation of Ms Khan will disincentivise her from continuing to obtain a financial or other material benefit from her husband.  It will also encourage others to dissociate from those individuals who have carried on business in sectors of strategic significance to the Government of Russia, and disincentivise others from associating themselves in future with (and obtaining a financial or other material benefit from) those individuals.  In these ways, the designation will isolate German Khan and others in his position.  It will also reduce the benefit they gain from their positions, given that this includes the ability to provide financial or material assistance to their associates, such as the extensive financial and material benefit German Khan has provided to Ms Khan.  This, in turn, will intensify the costs of their behaviour and amplify the incentives on German Khan and others in his position to take the actions set out above (see \\u00a771).\\nThe designation will also encourage Ms Khan to put pressure on her husband German Khan to take the actions set out above (see \\u00a771), in the hope of increasing the likelihood of the sanctions being lifted. Ms Khan explains that, at her request, German Khan previously transferred his shares in four properties to her, including the family home in the UK and their Italian property, and provided two financial gifts [REDACTED] \\u2026  This suggests that, contrary to what has been claimed, Ms Khan does in fact hold significant influence over German Khan and is in a position to put pressure on him as set out above.  German Khan may also be incentivised to act on his own initiative and change his behaviour in the hope that sanctions affecting Ms Khan will be lifted.\\nFurthermore, there is a material risk that German Khan could mitigate the impact of his asset freeze by holding assets through and/or moving assets into the names of his family members, including Ms Khan.  The holding of assets via associates is a widespread practice.  We assess that the likelihood of this risk materialising is increased by the pattern of German Khan's past behaviour, specifically the providing of substantial financial and other assistance to Ms Khan. German Khan provided Ms Khan with [REDACTED] in March 2022, shortly before he was designated.  The designation of Ms Khan will therefore reduce the likelihood that German Khan is able to circumvent the effect of the sanctions on himself, and in turn increases the likelihood that the designation of German Khan has its intended effect (see \\u00a771).\\u201d\\nThe financial licensing scheme\\nAs I have mentioned, there is a financial licensing scheme, which is intended to mitigate the harshness of the UK sanctions regime.  The scheme is operated by the Office of Financial Sanctions Implementation (\\u201cOFSI\\u201d), which is part of His Majesty\\u2019s Treasury and was established in March 2016.  It operates across the full range of sanctions regimes operative in the UK and, in the present context, the 2019 Regulations.  Its power to grant licences derives from Part 7 and, specifically, regulations 64 and 66 of the 2019 Regulations.\\nIn relation to the OFSI regime, Mr Reed stated the following, at para 100 of his first witness statement:\\n\\u201cI understand from colleagues at OFSI that the exponential increase in licence applications and queries since the commencement of the Russian invasion of Ukraine has resulted in longer assessment times in respect of some licence  applications.  OFSI (and the UK Government more generally) have taken various steps to respond to the evolving situation and to address the risk of delays in processing licence applications. For example, I understand that:\\nOFSI has extended its approach and made increased use of the flexibility granted by general licences to be more responsive to the needs of licence applicants, to address a broad range of recurring issues, and to mitigate the unintended consequences of sanctions on UK persons, while at the same time ensuring that UK sanctions policy objectives continue to be met.  Since the invasion of Ukraine OFSI has issued 50 general licences, including the general licences for legal fees and for payments to utilities companies for gas and electricity from which Ms Khan has benefited.\\nOFSI is in the process of developing streamlined procedures for assessing licence applications and prioritising cases appropriately.\\nOFSI is regularly updating its public guidance in relation to financial sanctions in general and the Russia sanctions regime in particular, as well as expanding its engagement across various sectors to ensure that it supports applicants in understanding the sanctions regimes and preparing complete licence applications.\\nOFSI has committed significant additional resources to its licensing functions, with a large increase in the number of staff now dedicated to assessing licence applications and queries arising from the conflict in Ukraine.\\u201d\\nThe licensing scheme was described in more detail in a Respondent\\u2019s Note which was requested by the Court and filed after the hearing of this appeal.  More recently still, the Court was provided with the following information by way of update to that Note:\\n\\u201cOn 14 January 2025,\\u00a0OFSI\\u00a0issued\\u00a0a\\u00a0new General Licence \\u2018Interim Basic Necessities for Designated Persons\\u2019 (\\u2018the Basic Needs\\u00a0Licence\\u2019). This applies to individuals designated for the purposes of an asset freeze by the UK (excluding those designated for the purpose of compliance with United Nations obligations) under the regulations listed in Annex 1 of the licence (\\u2018UK DPs\\u2019). The New Licence is available on OFSI\\u2019s website page\\u00a0of general licences.\\nIn summary,\\u00a0the Basic Needs\\u00a0Licence allows a person to make funds available to or for the benefit of a UK DP up to a permitted maximum of \\u00a3350 per month in each of the two months following the date of their designation for the purpose of that DP making defined permitted payments. Permitted payments are those for food and beverages, medicines/medical products and personal and household products. The Basic Needs\\u00a0Licence took effect from 00:01 on 15 January 2025 and will apply automatically to each UK DP from the point that they are designated until either\\u00a0a specific basic needs licence in respect of that UK DP takes effect or two months after the date of their designation\\u00a0(whichever is earlier).\\nOFSI considers the Basic Needs\\u00a0Licence to be a general licence for basic needs \\u2026\\u201d\\nThere are two sorts of licences granted by OFSI:  general licences and specific licences.  General licences provide a form of automatic authorisation for particular categories of expenditure falling within the scope of the general licence in question and do not require an application to be made.  Specific licences are individually assessed by OFSI in relation to a precise set of facts, usually at the request of an applicant.  In the course of determining a specific licence application, OFSI may require and seek further information from the applicant in order to enable it to process the application.\\nOFSI policy on general licences is set out in \\u2018UK Financial Sanctions General Guidance\\u2019.\\nOFSI has issued general licences for certain categories of payments that would cover a number of matters falling within the scope of basic needs:  for example, payment to energy companies for gas and electricity; payment to water companies; payment to local authorities; and payment to revenue authorities.\\nAt the time of the Appellant\\u2019s designation on 21 April 2022, the relevant general guidance included information on basic needs at para 6.9.  OFSI aimed to determine licence applications within four weeks, although urgent and humanitarian applications would be prioritised:  para 6.10.\\nThe guidance which is currently available is the \\u2018OFSI Designated Individuals Licensing Principles\\u2019 as well as the general guidance.  All are available on the Government website.\\nThe provisions on basic needs in the Licensing Principles Guidance include the following principles.  Principle 3 is that licensing decisions should not significantly cause harm to the health, or personal security of a designated person (\\u201cDP\\u201d) or a dependent family member.\\nPrinciple 4 is that licensing should permit basic needs, which OFSI considers to include a reasonable standard of living as compared to a person receiving the net UK median wage.  Ordinarily Principle 4 will be satisfied by granting a DP a sum equivalent to the net UK median wage.  Where expenditure is in excess of what can reasonably be expected under the net UK median wage, OFSI will take an objective view of what is required to fulfil the individual\\u2019s ordinary basic needs.\\nPrinciple 5 is that in most cases licences will not enable a designated person to continue the lifestyle or business activities which they had before they were designated.  In particular high net-worth individuals should not expect licences to allow a continuation of their previous lifestyle.\\nPrinciple 6 is that OFSI accepts that there is always a risk of economic harm to unconnected third party non-designated persons.  It will consider the impact of not licensing, or only partially licensing, on those third parties and whether that would have a significant detrimental impact on them.  However, this is not a determinative factor and must be balanced against upholding the objectives of the sanctions regime and the operational feasibility of licensing that activity.\\nThe general principles in the Licensing Principles Guidance include the following.\\nPrinciple 12 is that OFSI will generally permit a DP to receive money (for example a salary) into UK accounts.  Those funds should be transferred to frozen bank accounts and should not normally be received from another DP and must satisfy the relevant licensing purpose.\\nPrinciple 14 is that OFSI will not generally license activity which can reasonably be provided by the state (for example healthcare or education):  this is because these are usually available free at the point of access.\\nOFSI takes the view that the everyday use by a designated person of their own economic resources for personal consumption is not prohibited by the sanctions regime.  Nor does it prohibit others making available non-frozen assets (such as food) to a designated person for personal consumption.\\nIt is important to note that, until 15 January 2025, there was no general licence in place for basic needs.  OFSI takes the view that basic needs requests relating to living expenses have been largely managed through the specific licensing regime, which allows it to scrutinise applications and objectively consider the legal and policy justification for issuing a licence and manage the risk of asset flight.  OFSI takes as a starting point the consideration that licences should not enable a pre-designation lifestyle to continue but should enable a reasonable standard of living as compared to a person receiving the net UK median wage.\\nIt is acknowledged by OFSI that the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 led to an increase in the work which it had to do and a delay in allocating resources to that work.  Consequently, the delays experienced by the Appellant were more acute than would likely be experienced now.  For example, OFSI increased the resources in its licensing team by 160 percent in the financial year 2022-23.  Since the invasion of Ukraine OFSI has issued over 50 general licences.\\nUntil January 2025 OFSI policy provided for a licence capped monthly allowance which was equivalent to the net median wage for the DP and any of their dependants, while considering applications for a special licence on a case-by-case basis.\\nThe letter which was sent to the Appellant when she was originally designated was in a standard form in April 2022.  This made it clear that she could apply for a licence to allow for \\u201cbasic needs (such as for food or medical purposes)\\u201d.\\nIt is acknowledged by OFSI that, until January 2025, there was no guidance on how designated persons should meet their basic needs while an application for a specific licence was pending, because its policy was that urgent basic needs licences (on the basis of median salary) were granted in the interim where necessary.\\nGoing forward, OFSI and the FCDO can confirm that they remain committed to evaluating further improvements to this framework.  As I have mentioned at para 37 above, a new Basic Needs Licence was introduced in January 2025.\\nIn my view, it is troubling that, at the time of this case, the position was that a designated person could be put in the position where their own assets were frozen from the date of designation but no exception was made even for basic needs such as food until they had applied for, and been granted, a specific licence to meet those needs.  Even with a speedy and efficient licensing process, this would take some time.  In the meantime, the designated person, and others who try to provide them with economic resources, would (on the face of the 2019 Regulations) be committing a criminal offence if they did something as basic as buying food.  It cannot be a satisfactory answer as a matter of principle that it is unlikely that they would be prosecuted in practice.\\nNevertheless, I bear in mind that this particular aspect of this case has not featured as a specific ground of challenge in these proceedings.  I also bear in mind that, by the time of the only decision which is under challenge in these proceedings (the decision to maintain the Appellant\\u2019s designation on 28 February 2023), she had obtained relevant licences and was able to meet basic needs.\\nThe impact of the licensing scheme on the Appellant and her family\\nOn behalf of the Appellant George Maling, a solicitor, has filed four witness statements relating to the OFSI licensing scheme as it has affected the Appellant.\\nHe states that the Appellant\\u2019s experience has been that for each licence there have been various rounds of correspondence between her solicitors and OFSI before the application progressed to the final approval level, which took many months.  At the time of his first witness statement, dated 21 November 2022, solicitors then acting for the Appellant (W Legal) had made 12 licence applications for her but only five had resulted in licences being issued.  Schedule 1 to his first witness statement sets out a summary table of the applications and the licences.  The first application, for a basic needs and prior obligations licence, was made on 29 April 2022.  The final basic needs and prior obligations licence was issued by OFSI on 8 June 2022.  A draft of that licence had been issued on 1 June 2022, inviting comments on it, but it was confirmed on 7 June that the Appellant\\u2019s then solicitors had no comments on it.  Before that date, there had been a draft urgent utilities licence issued, which was granted in its final form on 27 May 2022.\\nIt is clear from the Schedule that the Appellant was subsequently granted various other licences, including in relation to legal fees and international travel.\\nHowever, Mr Maling observes that there were considerable delays in the issuing of those licences; and that, even when OFSI does issue a licence, the process of implementing it is problematic because licences do not compel third parties to act.  For example, they do not compel a bank to make the payments listed in the licence.  He concludes his first witness statement that, as presently structured, the OFSI licensing scheme is \\u201cwholly ineffective to mitigate the severe effects of the designation on the lives of Mrs Khan, her (non-designated) dependent children and other (non-designated) individuals connected with Mrs Khan, like her staff.\\u201d\\nIn his second witness statement, dated 4 May 2023, Mr Maling describes in particular the difficulties which the Appellant faced when applying for a licence for school fees.\\nThe Appellant\\u2019s youngest son was born in July 2012.  He was 11 months old when he moved to the UK, is a British citizen, and has received all of his education in the UK.  On 4 December 2022 W Legal applied to OFSI for a licence to permit the Appellant to make payment to his school for the remainder of the 2022/23 school year.  On 8 February 2023 OFSI confirmed that it would shortly issue a licence permitting the payment of the school fees.  It was granted under the prior obligations derogation.  However, OFSI also notified the Appellant that it did not intend to license the payment of further private school fees after July 2023 and that she should seek alternative arrangements for her child\\u2019s schooling in good time.\\nIn his fourth witness statement, dated 20 July 2023, Mr Maling states that the Appellant\\u2019s youngest son would have to leave his current fee-paying school and attend a state school from September 2023.  The Appellant considered that the impact of a school move on her son\\u2019s mental health would be deleterious.  A psychological report was obtained, in which it was recommended that the Appellant\\u2019s son should not move schools.  The Appellant remained anxious about how he would cope in a new school.\\nThe judgment of the High Court\\nIn the proceedings before the High Court there were three grounds of challenge:\\nThe Secretary of State failed to consider whether the Appellant\\u2019s designation was likely to further the statutory purpose of the 2019 Regulations, thereby acting ultra vires the 2019 Regulations, and/or failed to have regard to a mandatory relevant consideration, and/or acted unreasonably.\\nThe designation constitutes a disproportionate interference with the Appellant\\u2019s rights under Article 8 and Article 1 of the First Protocol (\\u201cA1P1\\u201d) to the European Convention on Human Rights (\\u201cECHR\\u201d).\\nRegulation 6(2)(d) of the 2019 Regulations is incompatible with Article 8 and A1P1 ECHR.\\nIt will be seen that the formulation of Ground 1 in fact compendiously put together three different public law arguments.  They were not all based on the Padfield principle (that a statutory power can only be used to further the purpose of the legislation that conferred that power and not for some extraneous purpose):  see Padfield v Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food [1968] AC 997;  only the first argument was.\\nThe Judge rejected Ground 1 at paras 80-102 of her judgment.  The essence of her reasoning in rejecting the Padfield argument can be found at para 92, where she said that:\\n\\u201cPadfield does not say anything about individualised consideration, it speaks only to purpose.\\u201d\\nThe Judge turned to the first limb of Ground 2 (which she described as \\u2018excessive breadth/unforeseeability\\u2019) at paras 103-117 of her judgment.  In that part of her judgment the Judge addressed the \\u201cin accordance with the law\\u201d limb of Ground 2.  She returned to other aspects of Ground 2 later in her judgment.\\nThe Judge rejected Ground 3, which concerned the compatibility of regulation 6(2)(d) of the 2019 Regulations, at paras 118-125 of her judgment.\\nThe Judge then returned to Ground 2, in relation to rational connection, and fair balance, under the rubric of \\u2018proportionality\\u2019, at paras 126-156 of her judgment.\\nThe Judge did not have the benefit of this Court\\u2019s judgment in Dalston Projects Ltd and Others v Secretary of State for Transport [2024] EWCA Civ 172; [2024] 1 WLR 3327.  That judgment, which included consideration of the appeal in Shvidler v Secretary of State for Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Affairs, was given on 27 February 2024, one week after the judgment in the present case.\\nAt the time of her judgment the Judge had the judgment of Garnham J in Shvidler and referred to it.  Although the decision in Shvidler was upheld by this Court, this Court held that Garnham J had erred in law as to the approach which must be taken by the reviewing court when considering the issue of proportionality under the Human Rights Act 1998 (\\u201cHRA\\u201d).  This Court then conducted the proportionality exercise for itself and came to the same result as Garnham J.  It is necessary at this stage to outline what this Court held in Dalston Projects, as it will inform how the human rights issues in this appeal should be approached.\\nThe judgment of this Court in Dalston Projects\\nThe main judgment in Dalston Projects was given by Singh LJ, with whom Whipple LJ agreed.  Sir Geoffrey Vos MR also agreed and gave a short concurring judgment on one aspect of the issues.  For convenience I will therefore refer to the main judgment as this Court\\u2019s judgment in that case.  It is under appeal to the Supreme Court, which heard the appeal in January 2025, but as things stand is binding on this Court.\\nBefore addressing each of the two appeals before the Court separately, it addressed two questions which were common to both.  First, what principles should a first instance court apply when reviewing a decision of the executive on grounds of proportionality under the HRA?  Secondly, what principles should an appellate court apply when reviewing a decision of a lower court in such a case?\\nThe Court set out the principle of proportionality at para 9, in particular by reference to the well-known formulation by Lord Reed JSC and Lord Sumption JSC in Bank Mellat v HM Treasury (No 2) [2013] UKSC 39; [2014] AC 700, at paras 74 and 20.\\nIt is necessary to determine:\\nwhether the objective of the measure is sufficiently important to justify the limitation of a protected right;\\nwhether the measure is rationally connected to the objective;\\nwhether a less intrusive measure could have been used without unacceptably compromising the achievement of the objective; and\\nwhether the measure\\u2019s contribution to the objective outweighs the effects on the rights of those to whom it applies.  The fourth limb is sometimes referred to as the \\u201cfair balance\\u201d issue or \\u201cproportionality stricto sensu\\u201d, i.e. in the strict sense.\\nAt paras 11-21, the Court set out the role of a first instance court when assessing proportionality.  At para 11, the Court said:\\n\\u201cIt is well-established that the question whether an act is incompatible with a Convention right is a question of substance for the court itself to decide; the court\\u2019s function is not the conventional one in public law of reviewing the process by which a public authority reached its decision\\u2026\\u201d  (Emphasis in original)\\nAs the Court went on to say, however, in particular at para 14, the fact that the court is the arbiter of proportionality does not mean there is no room for \\u201cappropriate respect and weight\\u201d to be given to the views of the executive.  As the Court said at para 20, by reference to the judgment of Lord Sales JSC in Director of Public Prosecutions v Ziegler [2021] UKSC 23; [2022] AC 408, at para 130, depending on the context, the court may afford a measure of respect to the balance of rights and interests struck by a public authority.\\nAt para 21, the Court said:\\n\\u201cIt is also well-established in the authorities that the context will include (1) the importance of the right \\u2026; (2) the degree of interference; (3) the extent to which the subject matter is one in which the courts are more or less well placed to adjudicate, both on grounds of institutional expertise (e.g. they are the guardians of due process but are much less familiar with an area such as the conduct of foreign relations or national security) and democratic accountability (e.g. when it comes to social and economic policy, including the allocation of limited resources).\\u201d\\nAt paras 22-37, the Court addressed the role of an appellate court when considering a decision on proportionality by a first instance court.  The Court analysed the earlier authorities as falling into three categories.  The first category, described at para 24, is where an appeal lies on a point of law by way of case stated.  In that context, an appellate court is not entitled to interfere with the first instance court\\u2019s assessment of proportionality (which is a question of fact) except on the grounds that the lower court has misdirected itself in law or has reached a conclusion which was not reasonably open to it on the evidence before it.\\nSecondly, as described at para 25, there is a group of cases in which the appellate court will not accord any deference to the assessment of proportionality by the first instance court but will carry out its own proportionality assessment.  This second category comprises primarily those cases which concern the compatibility of a rule or policy with Convention rights.  It is not concerned with cases where there has simply been an assessment of proportionality on the facts of an individual case:  see para 26.\\nAt para 28, the third category of cases was described as being those cases where there has been an assessment of proportionality by a first instance court on the facts of an individual case.  In that category, this Court held that its role is to exercise the conventional role that it plays on appeals under CPR 52.6.  In particular it does not sit to re-hear the issue but sits by way of review of the decision of the lower court and must consider whether the decision was \\u201cwrong\\u201d or \\u201cunjust because of a serious procedural or other irregularity in the proceedings in the lower court\\u201d:  see CPR 52.21.\\nAs the Court said at para 32, when an appellate court is considering this third category of cases, it cannot simply substitute its own assessment of proportionality for that of the lower court (as it can in the second category of cases); nor is it bound by that assessment unless it can say that the lower court has erred in law or its conclusion was not reasonably open to it (as in the first category of cases).\\nAt para 35, the Court considered it instructive to consider the approach neatly encapsulated in the extradition context by the Divisional Court in Polish Judicial Authority v Celinski (Practice Note) [2015] EWHC 1274 (Admin); [2016] 1 WLR 551, at para 24, where Lord Thomas CJ said:\\n\\u201cThe single question therefore for the appellate court is whether or not the District Judge made the wrong decision.  It is only if the court concludes that the decision was wrong \\u2026 that the appeal can be allowed.  Findings of fact, especially if evidence has been heard, must ordinarily be respected.  In answering the question whether the District Judge, in the light of those findings of fact, was wrong to decide that extradition was or was not proportionate, the focus must be on the outcome, that is on the decision itself.  Although the District Judge\\u2019s reasons for the proportionality decision must be considered with care, errors and omissions do not of themselves necessarily show that the decision on proportionality itself was wrong.\\u201d\\nThis Court summarised the single question for it as follows:\\n\\u201c\\u2026 Whether the assessment of the lower court was \\u2018wrong\\u2019 and we must apply the approach in In Re B.  This means, first, that we are not simply re-hearing the case as if we were the court of first instance.  Secondly, findings of fact by the lower court must ordinarily be respected, especially if it has heard oral evidence on factual matters that were in dispute.  Thirdly, the focus must be on the outcome of the assessment of proportionality.  We are not confined to asking whether the lower court erred in law or reached a conclusion which was not reasonably open to it.  There is a spectrum but if, at the end of the day, we consider that the outcome of the assessment of proportionality was wrong, we can and should say so.\\u201d\\nGround 1: Padfield\\nGround 1 in this appeal is that the Judge erred in concluding that the Secretary of State was not required, pursuant to the Padfield principle, to consider whether the individual designation of the Appellant was \\u201clikely\\u201d to further the statutory purpose of dissuading the Government of Russia from destabilising Ukraine or undermining or threatening the territorial integrity, sovereignty, or independence of Ukraine.\\nOn behalf of the Appellant Ms Montgomery submits that, on the undisputed evidence, there was no likelihood that the designation of this Appellant would have any material impact on the Government of Russia.  The Appellant is not, and never has been, personally involved in political affairs.  She has never been a supporter of the Putin regime.  She has never made any political donations to Mr Putin or to his party and has never attended any fundraising events for their benefit.\\nIn April 2022, before her designation, the Appellant registered for the UK Government\\u2019s \\u2018Homes for Ukraine\\u2019 programme, offering to provide accommodation in her home to Ukrainian citizens fleeing the conflict.  She has been involved, with her daughter, in charitable work to assist with the sending of essential supplies to the people of Ukraine.\\nI would reject Ground 1.  The ground as formulated is based on a misunderstanding of the Padfield principle.\\nIn Padfield, at page 1030, Lord Reid said that there is no such thing as an unfettered discretion in administrative law.  Parliament always confers a discretionary power with the intention that it should be used to promote the policy and objects of the Act concerned; and the policy and objects must be determined by construing the Act as a whole.  If a public authority uses its discretion to thwart or run counter to the policy and objects of the Act, then the decision will be unlawful.\\nThat principle requires that a discretionary power should be exercised so as to further the objects and policy of the legislation which confers it, and not to impede or frustrate that purpose.  It is not concerned with whether the exercise of a discretionary power is \\u201clikely\\u201d to further the statutory purpose.  It suffices that a discretionary power has been exercised for that purpose and not for some extraneous purpose (for example to penalise a political opponent).  There need not be bad faith:  the purpose of the decision may be a benign one but, if it is extraneous to the statute which confers the power, on its correct interpretation, then it will be unlawful.\\nThe submission for the Appellant conflates purpose with efficacy.  That latter issue may well give rise to a viable legal complaint but it would have to be brought on other grounds, for example that there was no rational connection between the means chosen and the aim in view.  That would simply be an application of the public law principle of rationality.\\nFor reasons that will become apparent below, when I address the Appellant\\u2019s human rights arguments under Ground 3, I would in any event reject any suggestion that there was no rational connection between the Appellant\\u2019s designation and its purpose.\\nGround 2:  regulation 6(2)(d) of the 2019 Regulations\\nGround 2 in this appeal is that the Judge erred in concluding that rule 6(2)(d) of the 2019 Regulations is compatible with Article 8 and/or A1P1 ECHR, on the basis that:\\nthe discretion to designate an individual who is merely \\u201cassociated with\\u201d a designated person is not \\u201csubject to \\u2026 conditions provided for by law\\u201d;\\nthe liability of an individual who is merely \\u201cassociated with\\u201d a designated person to designation is not rationally connected with the objectives sought to be pursued;  and/or\\nthe liability of an individual who is merely \\u201cassociated with\\u201d a designated person to designation is disproportionate.\\nGround 2(a)\\nGround 2(a) is concerned with the requirement that any interference with Convention rights must be \\u201cin accordance with the law\\u201d.  In my view, the legislative and common law framework in this context does provide sufficient clarity, certainty and safeguards against the possibility of abuse of power as to satisfy this requirement.\\nAs Lord Sumption JSC explained in In Re Gallagher [2019] UKSC 3; [2020] AC 185, at para 14, the condition of legality is not a question of degree.  \\u201cThe measure either has the quality of law or it does not.  It is a binary test.  This is because it relates to the characteristics of the legislation itself, and not just to its application in a particular case \\u2026\\u201d  This means that the measure, if it does not have the quality of law, will be incompatible with Article 8, however legitimate its purpose, and however necessary or proportionate it may be to deal with the problem in this particular way.\\nMs Montgomery relies on the requirements of the quality of law as set out by Lord Sumption at para 17:\\n\\u201cThe accessibility test speaks for itself.  For a measure to have the quality of law, it must be possible to discover, if necessary with the aid of professional advice, what its provisions are. In other words, it must be published and comprehensible.  The requirement of foreseeability, so far as it adds to the requirement of accessibility, is essentially concerned with the principle summed up in the adage of the American founding father John Adams, \\u2018a government of laws and not of men\\u2019.  A measure is not \\u2018in accordance with the law\\u2019 if it purports to authorise an exercise of power unconstrained by law.  The measure must not therefore confer a discretion so broad that its scope is in practice dependent on the will of those who apply it, rather than on the law itself.  Nor should it be couched in terms so vague or so general as to produce substantially the same effect in practice. The breadth of a measure and the absence of safeguards for the rights of individuals are relevant to its quality as law where the measure confers discretion, in terms or in practice, which make its effects insufficiently foreseeable.  Thus a power whose exercise is dependent on the judgment of an official as to when, in what circumstances or against whom to apply it, must be sufficiently constrained by some legal rule governing the principles on which that decision is to be made.  But a legal rule imposing a duty to take some action in every case to which the rule applies does not necessarily give rise to the same problem. It may give rise to a different problem when it comes to necessity and proportionality, but that is another issue.  If the question is how much discretion is too much, the only legal tool available for resolving it is a proportionality test which, unlike the test of legality, is a question of degree.\\u201d\\nMs Montgomery also relies on what was said about the quality of law in R (Bridges) v Chief Constable of South Wales Police [2020] EWCA Civ 1058; [2020] 1 WLR 5037, at paras 55-56, where the Court of Appeal approved the agreed summary of the general principles in the judgment of the Divisional Court, in particular sub-paragraphs (4) \\u2013 (6):\\nWhere the impugned measure is a discretionary power, (a) what is not required is \\u2018an over-rigid regime which does not contain the flexibility which is needed to avoid an unjustified interference with a fundamental right\\u2019 and (b) what is required is that \\u2018safeguards should be present in order to guard against overbroad discretion resulting in arbitrary, and thus disproportionate, interference with Convention rights\\u2019: per Lord Hughes JSC in Beghal v Director of Public Prosecutions [2016] AC 88, paras 31 and 32. Any exercise of power that is unrestrained by law is not \\u2018in accordance with the law\\u2019.\\nThe rules governing the scope and application of measures need not be statutory, provided that they operate within a framework of law and that there are effective means of enforcing them: per Lord Sumption JSC in Catt at para 11.\\nThe requirement for reasonable predictability does not mean that the law has to codify answers to every possible issue: per Lord Sumption JSC in Catt at para 11.\\u201d\\nMs Montgomery specifically places reliance on the decision of the Court of Appeal in that case at para 91, that there were two fundamental deficiencies in the legal framework in that particular context, which concerned the deployment by the police of automatic facial recognition technology.  The first was what was called the \\u201cwho question\\u201d and the second was the \\u201cwhere question\\u201d.  In relation to both of those questions too much discretion was left to police officers.  It was not clear who could be placed on a \\u201cwatchlist\\u201d; nor was it clear that there were any criteria for determining where the automatic facial recognition technology could be deployed.\\nIn my view, everything depends on the context.  There were particular reasons in Bridges why the quality of law was held to be absent.  In my view, the present legal regime has very different features.  The analogy with Bridges might be good if SAMLA and the 2019 Regulations did not define who was an \\u201cassociate\\u201d of an involved person and simply left that to the discretion of the executive but that is not the nature of the sanctions regime here.\\nFurthermore, I am impressed with the approach taken by the High Court in Phillips v Secretary of State for Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Affairs [2024] EWHC 32 (Admin); [2024] 1 WLR 2227.  At para 141, Johnson J said the following:\\n\\u201cThe 2019 Regulations are published and thus readily accessible. They operate in a foreseeable manner. They do not give the Secretary of State anything remotely approaching an unfettered discretion. A person may not be designated unless the Secretary of State reasonably suspects that the person is an \\u2018involved person\\u2019: regulation 6(1). The test for being an \\u2018involved person\\u2019 is tightly defined. The circumstances in which the power of designation might be exercised are foreseeable to a degree that is reasonable.  It is, in particular, foreseeable that a person who positively supports Russia\\u2019s propaganda war against Ukraine (for example, by parroting Russia\\u2019s propaganda narrative), rather than simply expressing an independent view which happens to align with Russia\\u2019s interests, might be subject to designation.\\u201d\\nHe added the following important passage, at para 144:\\n\\u201cThere are strong safeguards against arbitrariness. Aside from the need for reasonable suspicion of being an \\u2018involved person\\u2019, and the tightly drawn test for being \\u2018an involved person\\u2019:\\nThe purpose of the Regulations is explicitly prescribed, in clear and narrow terms: \\u2018encouraging Russia to cease actions destabilising Ukraine or undermining or threatening the territorial integrity, sovereignty or independence of Ukraine\\u2019 (regulation 4(a)).\\nThe power to designate a person may only be exercised for the narrowly drawn statutory purpose: Padfield [1968] AC 997, 1030C per Lord Reid.\\nThe 2019 Regulations were subject to the made affirmative procedure, and, for the first three years of their operation, the Secretary of State was required to provide annual reports to Parliament on their operation: section 30 of the 2018 Act.\\nThe need for the designation to be publicised, together with a statement of reasons: regulation 8(2)(b), 8(6)(a)(ii).\\nThe obligation to withdraw a designation when it no longer fulfils its statutory purpose: section 22(3) of the 2018 Act.\\nThe system of exceptions (for example, to allow payments to be made into a frozen account): regulations 58-63.\\nThe system of licences (whereby a designated person may seek authority to do anything which would otherwise be prohibited by a sanction): regulations 64-68.\\nThe right to request an administrative review of the designation: section 23 of the 2018 Act.\\nThe right to challenge a decision made on an administrative review, with that challenge being determined by the court: section 38 of the 2018 Act.\\nThe statutory duty not to act incompatibly with Convention rights: section 6(1) of the 1998 Act.  It follows that any decision under the Regulations that interferes with qualified Convention rights must be justified. In particular, the stringent four-part proportionality test must be satisfied before a person can be designated: Bank Mellat [2014] AC 700, para 74.\\u201d\\nGround 2(b)\\nTurning briefly to Ground 2(b), in my view, it is obvious that regulation 6(2)(d) of the 2019 Regulations does have a rational connection with the legitimate aim which it seeks to pursue.\\nOn the issue of rational connection, the Court in Dalston Projects said the following, at paras 190-191:\\nFirst, it is important to recall that what is required under the second limb of the Bank Mellat test for proportionality is a rational connection, no more and no less.  There does not have to be a perfect fit between the legitimate aim and the means chosen to achieve it, provided there is a rational connection between them.\\nSecondly, this is an objective test. It calls for analysis by the court itself.  As I have already mentioned, proportionality is, unlike conventional judicial review grounds, concerned with the substance of the matter, not the process by which the decision was reached.  If, as a matter of objective analysis, there is a rational connection proved to the court\\u2019s satisfaction, it is immaterial whether or not this featured in the reasoning process of the decision-maker at the time.\\u201d\\nAs the Court said in Dalston Projects, this calls for legal analysis and evaluation but, if evidence were needed for it, that evidence is to be found in the first witness statement of Mr Reed, at para 24 (quoted above), where he explains the ways in which the 2019 Regulations seek to put pressure on a foreign state by targeting not only those who are directly involved (such as Mr Khan) but those associated with those persons (for example family members such as this Appellant).  The underlying philosophy behind the sanctions regime is that the state concerned must come to appreciate that \\u201cinnocent\\u201d persons will suffer unpalatable consequences and so that state should change its behaviour.\\nAt para 123, the Court in Dalston Projects said that one of the ways in which economic sanctions can be effective is by increasing the disadvantages felt by citizens:  \\u201cIn this sense, the aim and the purpose of sanctions are not restricted to State institutions, or those who exercise political power and influence.  In this way sanctions may provide a peaceful way to impose pressure on a hostile State.\\u201d\\nWhen considering the issue of fair balance, the Court said in Dalston Projects, at para 210:\\n\\u201cI would accept that these sanctions are both severe and open-ended. But this does not meet the fundamental point that sanctions often have to be severe and open-ended if they are to be effective.  If sanctions are to be effective, a serious price has to be paid by those who are within the definition of people to be designated under the 2019 Regulations.  On the other side of the balance is Russia\\u2019s very serious violation of international law and the need to bring the invasion of Ukraine to an end.\\u201d\\nGround 2(c)\\nThe only way in which the Appellant could succeed under Ground 2(c)  is if she could demonstrate that in all cases, or at least in the generality of cases, the legislation was bound to be disproportionate:  see  the decision of the Supreme Court in Christian Institute v Lord Advocate [2016] UKSC 51; UKSC 29.  As Lord Reed explained at para 88, a challenge to the validity of legislation on the basis of a lack of proportionality faces a high hurdle.  This is sometimes known as an \\u201cab ante\\u201d challenge.  If a legislative provision is capable of being operated in a manner which is compatible with Convention rights in that it will not give rise to an unjustified interference with Article 8 rights \\u201cin all or almost all cases\\u201d, the legislation itself will not be incompatible with Convention rights.  That does not necessarily prevent an individual from challenging the application of that legislation in the particular circumstances of their case.  But it does prevent a challenge to the underlying legislation itself.\\nMs Montgomery KC accepted that this is the hurdle which she must overcome but submits that she is able to do so.  I do not accept that submission.  In my view, it is plain that the question whether a designation of a person, or a decision to maintain that designation is proportionate is highly fact-specific.  Regulation 6(2)(d) is not in itself disproportionate but its application to the facts of a particular case may be.\\nGround 3:  proportionality\\nGround 3 in this appeal is that the Judge erred in law and/or reached a conclusion which was \\u201cwrong\\u201d in concluding that the designation of the Appellant was a proportionate interference with her rights and those of her dependent children, pursuant to Article 8 and/or A1P1, on the basis of five sub-grounds, which I will address in turn.\\nGround 3(a)\\nGround 3(a) is that the Judge failed to adopt the correct approach, as clarified by this Court in Dalston Projects, that the question whether designation is compatible with Convention rights is a question of substance for the court itself to decide, rather than merely conducting a review of the Secretary of State\\u2019s decision.\\nI would reject Ground 3(a).  When the judgment of the High Court is read as a whole, it is clear, in my view, that the Judge did not fall into this error.  Her approach was consistent with the judgment of this Court in Dalston Projects even though she did not have the benefit of seeing that judgment at the time.\\nFurther, and in any event, even if I had thought that the Judge erred in her approach, I would reach the same conclusion, having conducted the proportionality assessment for myself.  In my view, far from being \\u201cwrong\\u201d, the Judge was right.\\nAt para 36 of her judgment, the Judge quoted in full paras 91-92 in the judgment of Garnham J in Shvidler.  At para 91, Garnham J had said:\\n\\u201cUndoubtedly, this is a case where close scrutiny is necessary in order to adjudicate on a complaint that Convention rights have been infringed.  And it is the structured analysis articulated in Bank Mellat that must be applied.  But the Court does not assume the role of primary decision maker on issues that turn on the exercise of judgment or the determination of policy, limiting itself instead to asking whether the decision was one properly open to the Executive.  \\u2026\\u201d  (Emphasis added)\\nMs Montgomery KC points out that that was one of the passages which led this Court to conclude in Dalston Projects that Garnham J had fallen into error as to the approach which the court itself has to take when assessing the proportionality of an interference with Convention rights:  see paras 164 and 168.\\nNevertheless, I accept Mr Blundell\\u2019s submission that, when it came to assessing the proportionality of the interference with Convention rights in the present case, the Judge did not in fact err in the way that Garnham J had erred.\\nThe Judge considered the issue of rational connection at paras 126-135 of her judgment.  Reading that part of her judgment fairly and as a whole, it is clear that the Judge asked herself the right question and answered it for herself.  She concluded in clear terms that there was \\u201ca more than rational connection\\u201d:  see para 131.  The Judge based herself on the evidence which she had considered and which she summarised, in particular the evidence of Mr Reed on behalf of the Secretary of State.\\nIt is notable that, at para 139, the Judge observed that there was no real challenge to the \\u201cless intrusive measure\\u201d limb of the Bank Mellat test.  That is essentially because any less intrusive measures have to be equally effective, and the Secretary of State (to whom in this context considerable deference is due) is clear that no less intrusive measures would be equally effective.  The Judge concluded on this aspect of the case, at para 140, that \\u201cit cannot be said that the Secretary of State was wrong to conclude that no less intrusive measures would suffice and that less intrusive measures would compromise the objective which lies at the heart of the sanctions regime.\\u201d\\nThe Judge then turned to the fair balance test itself, at paras 141-155 of her judgment.\\nThe Judge weighed the various factors on each side of the balance.  She said that on one side of the balance there was a factor which had to be given \\u201ca very heavy weight indeed\\u201d but that had to be balanced against \\u201cthe very considerable negative impacts on Ms Khan \\u2026 and also her family, including her dependent children \\u2026\\u201d.  The Judge then considered in detail the evidence before her, including as to the Appellant\\u2019s health and the mental health issues concerning her children.  At para 148, the Judge said that, while it is impossible not to have sympathy for both the emotional toll and the serious day-to-day difficulties which life as a designated person (or the child of a designated person) involves, \\u201cI do conclude \\u2013 even giving full weight to the personal cost of this family which I have had made very clear to me \\u2013 that the decision taken does not fall foul of the fair balance test.\\u201d  I have emphasised the introductory words in that sentence because they show that the Judge was expressing her own conclusion, not simply saying that the Secretary of State was entitled to reach the conclusion which he did.\\nHaving considered other aspects of the balancing exercise, including the availability of the licensing regime by OFSI (at para 153), the Judge concluded at para 155:\\n\\u201cIn the circumstances I conclude that the Secretary of State has not failed to strike a fair balance between the rights of Ms Khan and her family and the interests of the community.\\u201d\\nIt was that passage which formed the high point of Ms Montgomery\\u2019s criticism that the Judge fell into the same error as Garnham J in Shvidler.  I do not accept that submission.  In my view, the Judge was simply answering the question which the fair balance limb of Bank Mellat required her to answer, namely whether the decision-maker has, or has not, struck a fair balance between the rights of the individual and the general interests of the community.  That is not to abdicate the proper judicial responsibility for assessing proportionality but it is to recognise that there is still a decision made by the executive which is here being subjected to review by a court.  This Court said as much in Dalston Projects itself:  see e.g. para 19, where it said that the court is never the \\u201cprimary decision-maker\\u201d, because its function is still one of reviewing the decision of the public authority concerned to see whether it is compatible with a person\\u2019s Convention rights.\\nGround 3(b)\\nGround 3(b) is that the extent to which the Judge afforded \\u201cconsiderable respect\\u201d to the judgment made by the Secretary of State had the effect that the Judge erred in failing to determine the proportionality of the Appellant\\u2019s designation objectively on the basis of her own assessment.\\nAgain I would reject this submission.  As this Court pointed out in Dalston Projects, the Court can and should give \\u201cconsiderable respect\\u201d to the judgments made by the Secretary of State in this context, for example in relation to the conduct of foreign relations.\\nGround 3(c)\\nGround 3(c) is that the Judge erred in affording \\u201cconsiderable respect\\u201d to, and thereby failing properly to scrutinise, the Secretary of State\\u2019s assessment of the extent to which the designation of the Appellant could contribute to achieving the objective of the 2019 Regulations.\\nAgain I would reject this submission.  It adds nothing to what has been said earlier.\\nGround 3(d)\\nGround 3(d) is that, in the alternative, the Judge erred in failing to consider, as part of the proportionality balance, the extent to which the Appellant\\u2019s individual designation was likely to further the objective of the 2019 Regulations.  In this context it is submitted that, to the extent that a contrary approach is suggested by the decisions of the High Court in Dalston Projects and Shvidler, those cases were wrongly decided.\\nI would reject this submission because it fails to take into account that this Court has now decided the cases of Dalston Projects and Shvidler and the submission is inconsistent with what this Court said in its judgment.\\nGround 3(e)\\nGround 3(e) is that the Court erred in failing to consider the best interests of the Appellant\\u2019s dependent children as \\u201ca primary consideration\\u201d in conducting the proportionality balance.\\nMs Montgomery places reliance on the decision of the Supreme Court in H (H) v Deputy Prosecutor of the Italian Republic, Genoa [2012] UKSC 25; [2013] 1 AC 338 on the importance of the best interests of children.  The underlying obligation flows from an unincorporated treaty, namely the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, Article 3.1 of which provides that:\\n\\u201cIn all actions concerning children, whether undertaken by public or private social welfare institutions, courts of law, administrative authorities or legislative bodies, the best interests of the child shall be a primary consideration.\\u201d\\nThis has been held to inform the interpretation of the right to respect to private life in Article 8 of the ECHR, which is why this unincorporated treaty provision has some relevance in domestic public law.\\nHowever, as Lady Hale JSC pointed out at para 11, \\u201ca primary consideration\\u201d is not the same thing as \\u201cthe primary consideration\\u201d, still less as \\u201cthe paramount consideration\\u201d.  Where the decision directly affects the child\\u2019s upbringing, such as the decision to separate a child from her parents, then her best interests are the paramount or determinative consideration.  Where the decision affects the child more indirectly, for example by detention or deportation of one of the parents, then the child\\u2019s interests are primary, but not the paramount, consideration.\\nI do not accept that the Judge failed to have regard to the best interests of the Appellant\\u2019s children as a primary consideration in this case.  To the contrary, she had obvious sympathy for those interests, as do I.\\nThe relevance of the licensing scheme\\nAlthough the topic of the licensing scheme did not expressly feature in the grounds of appeal as such, it became clear during the course of the hearing that it lies at the heart of some of the complaints that Ms Montgomery makes.  She submits that the way in which the licensing scheme has operated in practice has had such a detrimental impact on the Appellant and her children, particularly her youngest child, including his education and his health, that the Respondent\\u2019s decision should be held to be disproportionate.\\nIn Dalston Projects, the Court addressed the issue of the licensing scheme at para 212:\\n\\u201cFurthermore, it is of some relevance that the Appellant and his family are able to meet the costs of their needs through the system of licensing operated by OFSI at HM Treasury.  If they have reason to complain about the way in which the licensing system is operated in practice in relation to them, they have a remedy available against HM Treasury but that would not be a reason to question the lawfulness of the designation of Mr Shvidler as such.\\u201d\\nIn the present appeal this Court has more evidence about the way in which the licensing scheme is operated and, as I have explained above, has also received more by way of submissions about this issue.\\nIn principle I would be prepared to accept that, if the FCDO knew (or perhaps ought reasonably to have known) at the time when it makes the relevant decision, either to designate or to maintain a designation after reviewing it, that HM Treasury had no functioning (or perhaps no reasonably functioning) licensing system, that could vitiate the decision to designate or maintain designation.  However, on the facts of the present case, the decision under challenge is that of 28 February 2023, when the FCDO maintained the decision to designate the Appellant and the evidence is that, certainly by that stage, it had been possible for appropriate licences to be applied for, and were obtained, by the Appellant from OFSI.\\nThis is not so much a question of legal personality (it might be said that the Crown is one entity, although that itself is not a straightforward matter in law because the \\u201cSecretary of State\\u201d is a distinct legal concept, being a corporation sole) but rather concerns what is the relevant decision.  Even if it were correct that there is a legal defect in the OFSI regime, I would not accept that that has a material bearing on the legality of the designation.  It is the designation, or strictly speaking the decision to continue it after the administrative review, which is the target of the present proceedings and which must be shown to be unlawful.  In the circumstances of this case, I am not persuaded that the relevant decision was unlawful.\\nGround 4:  right of access to a court\\nGround 4, for which the Appellant requires the permission of this Court, is that the scheme of court review of Ministerial designation decisions, constrained by \\u201cjudicial review principles\\u201d, as provided for in section 38(2) of SAMLA, is incompatible with the right of access to the court, as guaranteed by Article 6 ECHR and/or the procedural obligations guaranteed by Article 8.\\nOn behalf of the Appellant Ms Montgomery understandably places reliance on Ahmed and Others v HM Treasury [2010] UKSC 2; [2010] 2 AC 534.  In that case Sedley LJ memorably described persons who had been designated under the sanctions regime there in issue as \\u201ceffectively prisoners of the state\\u201d:  see page 580, para 125, cited with approval by Lord Hope at page 611, para 4.  As Lord Hope said at para 38, the impact on normal family life is \\u201cremorseless and it can be devastating\\u201d.  As Lord Mance said at para 249, designation as an \\u201cassociate\\u201d, and the consequential freezing of assets, also has \\u201cradical consequences for personal and family life.\\u201d  It is, as Lord Mance went on to say, a matter which one would expect to be subject to judicial control, before or after the designation.\\nMs Montgomery argues that the decision of Garnham J in R (Youssef) v Secretary of State for Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Affairs [2021] EWHC 3188 (Admin); [2022] 1 WLR 2454, which distinguished Ahmed in the present context, was wrong and should be overruled by this Court.  I disagree.  I agree with Garnham J that the sanctions regime in SAMLA is distinguishable from that which was considered by the Supreme Court in Ahmed.\\nIn particular the legal issues in Ahmed were different from the ones which arise in the present.  The principal issue for the Supreme Court in Ahmed was whether the domestic legislation giving effect to United Nations Security Council resolutions which required the freezing of assets of individual suspected terrorists was ultra vires the enabling power in the United Nations Act 1946 (\\u201cthe 1946 Act\\u201d).  The Supreme Court held that, applying the familiar principle that fundamental rights can only be overridden by express language or necessary implication, the general wording of section 1 of the 1946 Act did not empower the executive to enact the legislation by means of secondary legislation.  In particular, there was no fair procedure before the sanctions were imposed, because they had to be imposed by Member States so as to give effect to a designation on a list compiled by the UN Security Council and that body itself did not afford a fair process before a person\\u2019s name was placed on the list.  The Supreme Court also held that, in that context, there was no right of access to an effective judicial remedy and for that reason the legislation was ultra vires the general power conferred by section 1 of the 1946 Act.\\nIn the present context, by contrast, there is procedural fairness built in to the legislative scheme, both before and after the designation decision.  That procedural framework includes the opportunity to have access to an effective judicial remedy, namely under section 38(2) of SAMLA, by taking proceedings in the High Court.\\nI would grant permission to advance Ground 4 but would reject that ground on this appeal.  It founders for two fundamental reasons.  The first is that, as this Court has held in Dalston Projects, the relevant judicial review principles to be applied by the court in this context include deciding for itself whether there has been a violation of the Convention rights or not, in other words whether there has been a breach of section 6 of the HRA.  That guarantees sufficient access to an independent court\\u2019s adjudication in this context.\\nSecondly, the submission is wrong insofar as it suggests that access to a court requires in all circumstances that the court should be able to substitute its own assessment of all matters, including matters of fact, for that of the decision-maker.  Much depends on the particular context, as the European Court of Human Rights has held in cases such as Bryan v UK (1995) 21 EHRR 342 and the House of Lords made clear in R (Alconbury Developments Ltd) v Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions [2001] UKHL 23; [2003] 2 AC 295.\\nIn the present context the correct approach which the reviewing court must take under section 38(2) of SAMLA is as set out in Dalston Projects (summarised above).  Applying that approach does not require a full merits review of the Respondent\\u2019s decision to designate a person or maintain that designation, although it does require the court to assess the question of proportionality under the HRA for itself, giving due respect and weight to the views of the Respondent.  That approach is not incompatible with the right of effective access to a court under the ECHR.\\nConclusion\\nFor the reasons I have given, I would dismiss this appeal.\\nLord Justice Dingemans:\\nI agree that the appeal should be dismissed for the reasons given by Singh LJ.  I wish to address the issue of ordinary living expenses for designated individuals such as the Appellant, after designation pursuant to the 2019 Regulations and before the Office of Financial Sanctions Implementation (\\u201cOFSI\\u201d) has issued a specific licence for basic needs including the purchase of food.  This is in circumstances where submissions were made on behalf of the Appellant complaining about the practical effect of the sanctions regime on her and her family and delays in the issue of licences to permit expenditure on basic needs.\\nIt is apparent that, upon designation, the designated individual will commit a criminal offence if they deal with funds or economic resources to pay for ordinary living expenses.  It will also be a criminal offence for another individual to make available funds or economic resources available directly or indirectly to that designated person:  see para 15 above.\\nOFSI has power to grant licences to enable funds to be spent pursuant to Part 7 and regulation 64 of the 2019 Regulations, as described in paras 35 to 55 above.  This includes a power to grant a licence for basic needs as set out in para 2 of Schedule 5 to the 2019 Regulations.  The basic needs equate to ordinary living expenses and, as might be expected, include the need for food:  see para 2(1)(b)(i) of Schedule 5.\\nIt is apparent from the Respondent\\u2019s Note referred to in para 37 above, that OFSI provides general licences to enable payments for matters such as gas, electricity and water to be made.  These general licences were available to the Appellant.  OFSI did not, however, provide a general licence to permit payments for food to be made.  It appears (from para 11 of the Respondent\\u2019s Note) that OFSI took the view that OFSI should scrutinise applications before issuing such a licence.  As it was, there were delays before a specific licence was issued to the Appellant to enable her to buy food, and despite improvements in timeliness, there will inevitably be some delays caused by the application process in issuing a specific licence to cover basic needs.  So far as the Appellant was concerned, this meant that she became liable to a criminal prosecution for purchasing food before the specific licence was issued.  In the event no criminal proceedings were brought.\\nAs appears from para 1 above, the challenge engaged on this appeal was to the Respondent\\u2019s decision dated 28 February 2023 to maintain the designation after a review.  By 28 February 2023 the issue of a specific licence to cover the Appellant\\u2019s basic needs beyond those covered by the general licences for matters such as gas, electricity and water, had been addressed.  This means that the failure to provide the specific licence for ordinary living expenses including food is not a basis for challenging the decision in this appeal.  That does not mean, however, that the Respondent can continue to designate people without addressing the issue of ordinary living expenses as from the date of designation.  It is apparent that OFSI uses a monthly allowance equivalent to the net median wage for designated persons when a specific licence is issued (see para 12 of the Respondent\\u2019s Note), and it is apparent that OFSI would be able to issue such a specific licence to a person immediately on designation using such sums.\\nThe Respondent suggests that it is unlikely to prosecute a designated person for buying food before a special licence has been issued.  That is not an answer to the issue, because the designated person becomes dependent on the exercise of a prosecution discretion.\\nIn my judgment the Respondent has not identified any good reason for the failure to make immediate provision for expenditure on ordinary living expenses including food by way of specific licence when designating an individual, and it is neither reasonable, nor fair to the designated person, to fail to make provision for basic living expenses, including food, on designation.  This is because the designated person will either be liable to prosecution for a criminal offence or be unable to eat.  Similar issues were confronted by the courts when dealing with the development of the protections for those subject to Mareva injunctions, now called freezing orders.  The standard form of order for freezing orders now makes provision for ordinary living expenses:  see Practice Direction 25A of the Civil Procedure Rules and the form of standard order annexed to the Practice Direction, and the courts will not grant freezing orders without such protections.\\nI am pleased to note that, since the hearing of this appeal, OFSI has issued a new General Licence for \\u2018Interim Basic Necessities for Designated Persons\\u2019.\\u00a0 Details of this general licence are set out in para 37 of Singh LJ\\u2019s judgment.\\nLord Justice Underhill:\\nI agree that this appeal should be dismissed for the reasons given by Singh LJ.  But I wish also strongly to endorse what both he and Dingemans LJ have said about the operation of the licensing regime.\\nSome people assume that sanctions under the 2019 Regulations are only imposed on non-British nationals for whom the UK is not their principal place of residence, and only on people who are directly associated with the Russian Government and/or in a position to influence its decisions.  But, as the present case illustrates, that is not so.  The Appellant and her children were and are British citizens, for whom this country is their only home; and she is designated not because she is herself associated with the Russian government or supports the invasion of Ukraine but because she is married to (though living largely separately from) Mr Khan, who has been involved in obtaining a benefit from or supporting the Government of Russia.  The effect of designation is that she is not entitled to use any of her assets at all, even for the basic necessities of life for herself and her children, without first obtaining the permission of civil servants in the Treasury.  At para 140 above Singh LJ refers to Sedley LJ\\u2019s description in Ahmed of the persons designated under the sanctions regime there in issue as \\u201ceffectively prisoners of the state\\u201d, and the similar observations of Lord Hope and Lord Mance in the Supreme Court.  The particular question in that case was different but what was said there is equally apt in the present case.\\nThere is no doubt that in principle the Regulations authorise the designation of UK-resident British nationals, notwithstanding its potentially devastating impact on them and their families, for important reasons of policy which one can well understand.  The payment made by Mr Khan to the Appellant shortly before his own designation (which was huge) illustrates the risk that principals may transfer assets to family members in order to avoid or mitigate the effect of sanctions on themselves.  Of course, the effect of designation goes beyond particular assets or funds transferred for such a purpose and extends to the totality of the person\\u2019s assets; but this could in principle be justified by the kinds of consideration identified at para 72 (a)-(c) of Mr Reed\\u2019s witness statement quoted at para 34 above \\u2013 which might, as Mr Blundell acknowledged, be rather less coyly summarised as making the principal\\u2019s family suffer as a means of putting pressure on him or her to withdraw their support from the regime.\\nAgainst that background, it is in my view of fundamental importance that there should be in place a fair and efficient system of licensing, operating according to defensible and clearly-stated principles, which mitigates the potentially devastating impact of designation on UK-resident persons.  The material before us does not suggest that the Secretary of State, or the Treasury, has given proper attention to this aspect of the sanctions regime.   In the evidence which Singh LJ summarises at paras 59-65 above the Appellant complains of serious delays by OFSI in responding to her requests to authorise particular necessary expenditures; and in the witness statement quoted at para 36 Mr Reed appears to acknowledge that those complaints are, at least to a considerable extent, justified.  In particular, it is remarkable that there was not at the time of the hearing before us a system in place for making immediate provision for expenditure on ordinary living expenses from the moment of designation.  I am bound to say that my concerns about the system are not wholly mitigated by the belated introduction of the Basic Needs Licence recorded by Singh LJ at para 37; but since there was in these proceedings no direct challenge to the principles of the system or its practical operation it would not be appropriate for me to say more.\\n[2025] EWCA Civ 41\\nThe original format of the judgment as handed down by the court, for printing and downloading.\\nThe judgment in machine-readable LegalDocML format for developers, data scientists and researchers.\\nAll content is available under the Open Justice Licence.\\n        \\n        For re-use that is not covered by the Open Justice Licence, please apply for licence to do computational analysis..\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
