    "#### Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Handle `None` Input**:\n",
    "   - If the `text` is `None`, the function returns an empty string (`\"\"`), ensuring that `None` values do not cause errors in further processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Filter Unwanted Text**:\n",
    "   - The function checks if the text contains certain unwanted phrases:\n",
    "     - If the text contains `\"cookies\"` (case-insensitive) or `\"find case law\"` (case-insensitive), it is deemed irrelevant and discarded by returning an empty string (`\"\"`).\n",
    "   - This step is useful for removing common boilerplate or irrelevant content (e.g., cookie notices or promotional phrases) from legal text.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Remove Leading and Trailing Whitespace**:\n",
    "   - The `strip()` method is used to remove any leading or trailing whitespace from the text.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Format Dates**:\n",
    "   - The function uses a regular expression (`re.sub()`) to match and reformat dates in the form of `day-month-year` (e.g., \"1st January 2020\") to the format `year-month-day` (e.g., \"2020-January-1\").\n",
    "   - This is achieved by matching patterns like \"1st January 2020\" and converting them into \"2020-January-1\".\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Remove Empty Text Tags**:\n",
    "   - The function uses another regular expression (`re.sub()`) to remove any occurrences of the string `\"<text />\"`, which might represent empty or unwanted XML tags in the input.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Return Cleaned Text**:\n",
    "   - After the cleaning process, the function returns the cleaned version of the input text, with irrelevant content removed, dates reformatted, and unnecessary tags stripped.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Output:\n",
    "- The cleaned version of the input text, with dates formatted in `year-month-day` style and unwanted phrases or tags removed."

    "#### Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Open the CSV File for Writing**:\n",
    "   - The `open()` function is used to open or create a CSV file specified by `csv_file_path` in write mode (`'w'`).\n",
    "   - `newline=''` ensures no extra blank lines are added between rows, and `encoding='utf-8'` ensures that the CSV file can handle Unicode characters.\n",
    "   - A `csv.writer` object is created to write rows to the CSV file, which is expected to contain only one column (for the cleaned case text).\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Write Header to CSV**:\n",
    "   - The `writer.writerow()` method is used to write the header row, which contains the column name `'cleaned_text'`. This will label the column in the CSV file.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Parse XML File**:\n",
    "   - The XML file at `xml_file_path` is parsed using `ET.parse()`, and the root element of the XML document is retrieved using `getroot()`. This provides access to all the `<case>` elements within the XML structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Iterate Through Case Elements**:\n",
    "   - The code iterates over all `<case>` elements found in the XML file using `findall(\".//case\")`. Each case represents a collection of `<text>` elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Clean Text Elements**:\n",
    "   - For each `<case>`, the code initializes an empty list `cleaned_texts` to store the cleaned text content.\n",
    "   - It then iterates through all `<text>` elements within the case using `findall(\".//text\")`.\n",
    "   - The text content of each `<text>` element is passed to the `clean_text()` function for cleaning (e.g., removing irrelevant content, formatting dates).\n",
    "   - If the cleaned text is not empty, it is appended to the `cleaned_texts` list.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Write Cleaned Text to CSV**:\n",
    "   - After processing all the `<text>` elements for a given case, the `cleaned_texts` list is joined into a single string, with each cleaned text entry separated by a newline (`\"\\n\"`).\n",
    "   - This string is written to the CSV file as a single row using `writer.writerow()`, ensuring each row contains the cleaned content of one case.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Completion Message**:\n",
    "   - After processing all cases, the code prints a message indicating that the processing is complete and the cleaned data has been saved to the specified CSV file.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Output:\n",
    "- The cleaned case law text is saved in a CSV file at `csv_file_path`. Each row contains the cleaned text of one case, with the individual sections of text separated by newlines within that row."
