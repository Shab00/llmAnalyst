MR JUSTICE KERR
Mr Justice Kerr :
Introduction
The respondent requesting territory wishes to extradite the appellant to St Maarten to stand trial for murder and possessing a firearm, under the law of St Maarten, an overseas territory of the Kingdom of the Netherlands.  However, the respondent proposes that the appellant should be detained in the Netherlands during most of the pre-trial and trial process; and in Aruba for the final part of that process.  The actual trial in Aruba is estimated to last two days.
The respondent proposes that if the appellant is acquitted, he will be released in St Maarten; and that if he is convicted, he will serve his sentence in a prison in the Netherlands and will be released in St Maarten when he has finished serving his sentence.  It is therefore not envisaged by the respondent that the appellant will set foot in St Maarten until the end of the trial process and the end of any sentence if he is convicted.
The appellant says these proceedings are an abuse of process because while proposing to extradite the appellant to St Maarten, the respondent in fact intends to extradite him to the Netherlands.  If the appellant is extradited, he will travel under escort not to St Maarten but to the Netherlands.  The appellant says that is contrary to the Extradition Act 2003 (the 2003 Act): it only permits removal to the geographical territory of the category 1 or 2 territory requesting extradition.
The respondent submits that there is no abuse of process here: the appellant’s interpretation of the 2003 Act is wrong.  The correct interpretation is that extradition to a particular “territory” includes removal of the requested person to a place not physically within that territory, but where its law applies to the criminal proceedings and where it has and exercises jurisdiction over the requested person at his trial.
The issue I have just identified is the only remaining point in this appeal.  It was not argued before the magistrates’ court.  Mr Graeme Hall, now appearing for the appellant, did not appear below.  The only point taken below was that extradition would be incompatible with the appellant’s rights under article 8 of the European Convention.  In the earlier phases of this appeal, the present issue was added, among others.  Permission to appeal was refused by Wall J on the papers, but granted on oral renewal by Chamberlain J, on this issue only.
In his judgment on renewal, he described the point as a “short and crisp point of law” which “ought, in the interests of justice, to be decided even though the point was not taken at first instance.”  He added that the point may “become relevant in other cases if extradition is later sought to territories which do not have their own detention facilities or, at least, do not have detention facilities which can be used in the individual case.”
Outline of the Facts
The appellant is a national of St Kitts and Nevis, born in June 1985.  The respondent alleges that the appellant shot Mr Amador Jones six times near a snack bar in St Maarten on 16 April 2011.  Mr Jones died of his wounds the next day.  The killing is said by the prosecuting authorities in St Maarten to have occurred in the context of a feud about the trafficking of cocaine.
As Chamberlain J explained in Heilligger v Government of Sint Maarten and Secretary of State for the Home Department [2023] EWHC 422, at [1]:
“The island of Saint Martin lies in the northeast Caribbean Sea. The northern part of the island is known by its French name, Saint Martin, and is constitutionally a collectivité d'outre-mer (overseas territory) of the French Republic. The southern part is known by its Dutch name, Sint Maarten, and is one of four autonomous landen (countries) of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. Curaçao, in the southern Caribbean Sea, is another. Sint Maarten and Curaçao have been designated category 2 territories for the purposes of the Extradition Act 2003 … .”
The fourth land within the Kingdom of the Netherlands is Aruba, also designated as a category 2 territory under the 2003 Act.
The appellant came to the United Kingdom in February 2022.  The St Maarten authorities issued an arrest warrant for him 30 March 2022.  On 18 April 2022, Deputy Senior District Judge Ikram issued a provisional arrest warrant.  The appellant was remanded in custody.  On 12 May 2022, the Minister of Justice for St Maarten issued an extradition request. On 26 May 2022, the Secretary of State issued a certificate under section 70 of the 2003 Act, confirming that the extradition request was valid.
In October 2022, the St Maarten public prosecutor made two sworn statements explaining the proposed arrangements for the appellant’s detention and trial, if he were extradited.  He was considered a high risk prisoner for whom St Maarten’s one prison was not suitable.  He would initially be detained in a Netherlands prison.  The trial would take place under the laws of St Maarten, which would bear the cost of his defence lawyer.
The first part of the trial process would take place in the Netherlands.  As described by the prosecutor, it approximately corresponds to our case management process.  Often, the defendant does not appear at hearings at which he is represented by his lawyer, or appears by video link.  If the appellant were convicted, he would serve his sentence in the Netherlands but the law of St Maarten would apply to any release on parole.
In the second statement the prosecutor explained that the final phase of the trial, an oral hearing expected to last two days, would take place in Aruba, where the appellant would be detained in a court cell for the duration of the trial.  If convicted, he would serve his sentence in the Netherlands.  If acquitted, or on completion of his sentence, he would be returned to and released in St Maarten.
In a further statement made in December 2022, the Solicitor-General of St Maarten explained that the Dutch authorities had stated they would not comply with the request to implement the above arrangements (known as an “ORD” request) while the extradition process in the United Kingdom is ongoing; but they would comply with the ORD request if and when the appellant were extradited by the United Kingdom authorities.
The extradition hearing took place on 6 January 2023 before Senior District Judge Goldspring.  He rejected the article 8 point and sent the case to the Secretary of State.  On 1 March 2023, the latter ordered the appellant’s extradition to St Maarten.  The appellant appealed against the ruling that the case should be sent to the Secretary of State.  Wall J refused permission to appeal on the papers, on 13 August 2023.  On 5 November 2024, Chamberlain J granted permission on the single ground of appeal now before me.
Relevant Legal Framework
The Kingdom of the Netherlands (as stated in the skeleton argument of Mr Peter Caldwell for the respondent without dissent from the appellant) comprises:
“four countries: (a) the Netherlands; (b) Aruba; (c) Curaçao; and (d) Sint Maarten. In addition, the Islands of Bonaire, Sint Eustatius and Saba are special municipalities of the Netherlands. Although the separate countries of the Kingdom are self-governing, certain matters concerning the Kingdom as a whole (such as foreign affairs) are within the competence of the Kingdom itself. Only the Kingdom has international legal personality and thus can be considered to be a State with the power to conclude, ratify and accede to international legal agreements, such as treaties and conventions. Thus, it is the Kingdom (and not its constituent parts) that entered into extradition relations with the United Kingdom; it is the Kingdom that is responsible in international law for the legal obligations that arise from that relationship; and it is the Kingdom that has responsibility for ensuring that the Appellant’s rights under the European Convention of Human Rights are respected.”
The Kingdom of the Netherlands (the Kingdom) was one of the six founding member states of the European Economic Community (EEC), being a signatory to the Treaty of Rome, signed on 25 March 1957.  A protocol to the Treaty of Rome excluded the Caribbean parts of the Kingdom from the application of the Treaty of Rome, which was confined to the European parts of the Kingdom.
The same year, the European Convention on Extradition (the ECE) was signed in Paris, on 13 December 1957.  The signatories were Council of Europe member states, including the Kingdom and the United Kingdom.  The official languages were English and French.  Article 27(1) confined the application of the ECE to “the metropolitan territories of the Contracting Parties”.
However, there were exceptions and qualifications in article 27(2) and (3) in the case of France, the Federal Republic of Germany (i.e. West Germany) and the United Kingdom.  Article 27(4) provided, and still provides, in the English text:
“By direct arrangement between two or more Contracting Parties, the application of this Convention may be extended, subject to the conditions laid down in the arrangement, to any territory of such Parties, other than the territories mentioned in paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 of this article, for whose international relations any such Party is responsible.”
On 13 November 1962, a Convention was signed in Brussels, amending the Treaty of Rome to make “the special system of Association defined in Part Four of that Treaty applicable to the Netherlands Antilles”.  However the ECE did not then extend beyond the Kingdom’s European territory, as the Kingdom made clear in a declaration made on 21 January 1965.  That was the position when the UK joined the European Community (EC) on 1 January 1973.
Extradition statutes in this country go back to the 1840s.  Until the 2003 Act, the most recent was the Extradition Act 1989, now repealed.  I was not taken to that Act but understand that after it was passed it applied to cases of extradition under the ECE until the advent of the 2003 Act.  In the Explanatory Notes to the 2003 Act (paragraph 8), it is explained that the Extradition Act 1989:
“is essentially a consolidation of three earlier pieces of legislation: Part 1 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988, the Fugitive Offenders Act 1967 and the Extradition Act 1870 (as amended).”
The Extradition Act 1989 was, therefore, the governing domestic legislation when, on 8 November 1994, the Kingdom presented a Diplomatic Note to the UK that the application of the ECE was extended to the Netherlands Antilles and Aruba.  The UK government then undertook an extensive review of extradition law, as explained in the Explanatory Notes to the later 2003 Act:
The Government set out its proposals to reform the law on extradition in a consultation document ‘The Law on Extradition: A Review’ in March 2001. It was the outcome of an exercise started in 1997 to consider the legislative requirements of two European Union Conventions on Extradition. However, it developed into a much more extensive inquiry, following the adoption at the Tampere Special European Council in October 1999 of the principle of mutual recognition of judicial decisions by Member States of the European Union.
The publication of the Review followed an extensive period of consultation with officials from a number of organisations including the Crown Prosecution Service, Lord Chancellor's Department, Bow Street Magistrates' Court, Metropolitan Police, Foreign and Commonwealth Office and others. Its proposals, which were aimed at modernising arrangements between the United Kingdom and its extradition partners, included:
• creating a four level framework with countries being designated for each tier by way of an Order in Council;
• a simple fast track extradition procedure for Member States of the European Union;
• retention of current arrangements for non-European Union states with modifications to reduce the duplication and complexity of extradition procedures;
• a single avenue of appeal for all extradition cases; and
• accession to the 1995 and 1996 European Union Conventions on Extradition.”
However, as explained in paragraph 12:
“… The proposals in the Review have also been overtaken by progress in respect of extradition to other European Union Member States. This Act [i.e. the 2003 Act] includes provisions implementing the following European Community Legislation: the Council Framework Decision of 13 June 2002 on the European arrest warrant and the surrender procedures between Member States (2002/584/JHA).”
The main elements of the Framework Decision were transposed into UK law, in what became Part 1 of the 2003 Act, in force from 1 January 2004.  Part 2 governed extradition to other designated territories to which the ECE applied.  As Sir Igor Judge P (as he then was) put it in R (Norris) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2006] 3 All ER 1011 at [25] (in the context of extradition arrangements with the United States of America), the 2003 Act:
“introduced a reformed, radically changed scheme, and provides the legislative structure which governs the process of extradition from the United Kingdom … .”
The differences between the Part 1 procedures and the Part 2 procedures are well known and need not be set out in detail here.  Part 1 proceedings start with issue of a European Arrest Warrant (EAW) and certification thereof as valid.  Part 2 proceedings are started by issue of a certificate of validity by the Secretary of State, following receipt of an extradition request from a category 2 territory.
Designation of “category 1 territories” is provided for by section 1 of the 2003 Act.  For “category 2 territories” the equivalent provision in Part 2 is section 69.  The miscellaneous and general provisions in Part 5 include section 223(8) which provides:
A territory may be designated by being named in an order made by the Secretary of State under this Act or by falling within a description set out in such an order.”
The designation of territories under Parts 1 and 2 of the 2003 Act was done by means of two statutory instruments, the Extradition Act 2003 (Designation of Part 1 Territories) Order 2003 (the Part 1 designation order) and the Extradition Act 2003 (Designation of Part 2 Territories) Order 2003 (the Part 2 designation order).  Updating amendments designating new territories have been added from time to time.
With rare exceptions, the territories have been designated by name, not by description (Footnote: 1).  Under the Part 1 designation order, among the territories designated as category 1 territories on 1 January 2004 were “The Netherlands” and other EU states.  In the Part 2 designation order, many non-EU territories and overseas territories of EU states outside the geographical boundaries of Europe were designated as category 2 territories.
On 31 August 2005, the Kingdom made a declaration confirming that the ECE continued to govern extradition relations between the Caribbean parts of the Kingdom and the other signatories to the ECE.  The Netherlands Antilles were then dissolved in 2010, following constitutional reforms in the Kingdom.  At that stage in the history, the fatal shooting of Mr Amador Jones occurred, in St Maarten in April 2011.
The Kingdom issued a further Diplomatic Note dated 27 June 2013, stating that its reservations and declarations in relation to the territorial extent of the ECE:
“apply to Aruba and, as succeeding to the Netherlands Antilles, to Curaçao, Sint Maarten and the Caribbean part of the Netherlands (the islands of Bonaire, Sint Eustatius and Saba) in their relations with the States with which notes were exchanged on the extension of the Convention.”
The Council of the European Union issued a Decision 2013/755/EU of 25 November 2013 on the association of overseas countries and territories with the European Union.  This confirmed that the Caribbean territories of Aruba, Curaçao, Sint Maarten, Bonaire, Sint Eustatius and Saba enjoy the status of (in the English language) “Overseas Country and Territory” (OCT).
In Prunus SARL v. Directeur des Services Fiscaux, Case C-384/09, [2011] 3 CMLR 7, at [AG26] (concerning the application of tax laws to properties in France owned by entities in the British Virgin Islands) Advocate-General Cruz-Villalón explained the position of OCTs thus:
“the OCTs are not sovereign States with international legal personality but rather ‘territories’ linked to a Member State on the basis of special historical, social and political ties. Even though they are political communities which are formally integrated into the State with which they share a special bond, they are afforded a particular status in the Treaties, specifically based on the territorial scope of EU law. Thus, art.355 TFEU reiterates the provisions of art.52 TEU (which lists the signatory Member States for the purpose of defining the territorial scope of the Treaty) and then goes on to state that, in addition to that provision, a number of provisions are to apply, including para.2, which provides that OCTs are covered by ‘[t]he special arrangements for association set out in Part Four.’”
By an amendment to the Part 2 designation order effective from 15 April 2015, the Secretary of State designated the six Netherlands OCTs (Aruba, Curaçao, Sint Maarten, Bonaire, Sint Eustatius and Saba) as category 2 territories.  That account of the history explains why the Netherlands itself, i.e. the European part of the Kingdom, is designated under Part 1 of the 2003 Act; while the Netherlands OCTs, including St Maarten, are designated under Part 2.
For completeness, under the Brexit-related legislation, for those who, like the appellant, were arrested after 11pm on 31 December 2020, the EAW arrangements pursuant to the Framework Decision are replaced by equivalent arrangements (with some modifications I do not need to go into here) under Part Three (Law Enforcement and Judicial Cooperation in Criminal Matters), Title VII (Surrender) of the Trade and Cooperation Agreement (TACA) (Footnote: 2).
Submissions
Summary of Appellant’s Submissions
For the appellant, Mr Hall submitted that it was an abuse of process to seek the appellant’s extradition to St Maarten while not intending that he would ever set foot there until the end of the trial process or the end of any sentence.  The court, he pointed out, has an implied power to stay extradition proceedings where extradition may usurp the integrity of the 2003 Act.  It is not necessary to show bad faith on the part of the requesting party.
His argument, he said, was simple: the requesting territory is the only territory to which the appellant can lawfully be extradited.  He cannot be sent to the Netherlands or Aruba because neither is the requesting territory, neither has sought the appellant’s extradition and that is because the alleged offences were not committed on their territory but on that of St Maarten.  It is irrelevant, said Mr Hall, that St Maarten is, constitutionally, part of the Kingdom.  It is a separate territory designated under Part 2 of the 2003 Act as a territory in itself.
The Secretary of State could have designated the whole of the Kingdom as a single territory but has not done so.  In oral argument, Mr Hall gave the example of a request for extradition by Sierra Leone, with the requested person subsequently facing trial in Singapore.  The requested person would have to address potential bars to extradition in both the requesting territory and the territory to which the trial was to be outsourced.
That would be a usurpation of the statutory scheme outside the contemplation of the legislature when enacting the 2003 Act, he said.  In support of his propositions of law on abuse of process Mr Hall cited, uncontroversially, R. (Bermingham) v. Serious Fraud Office [2007] QB 727 per Laws LJ at [97]; Auzins v Latvia [2016] 4 WLR 75 per Burnett LJ (as he then was) at [44]; Giese v USA [2018] 4 W.L.R. 103 at [32] per Lord Burnett CJ at [32]; and Jasvins v. Latvia [2020] EWHC 602 (Admin) (Davis LJ and Swift J) (see at [13]-[20]).
Mr Hall submitted that this was a paradigm case of abuse.  It is per se abusive, he argued, to seek extradition of a person to a place – i.e. the Netherlands and Aruba - to which the statutory scheme contains no power to extradite him.  If the argument had been raised before the Senior District Judge, Mr Hall contended, he would have been obliged to stay and would have stayed the proceedings as an abuse.
Chamberlain J had been right on this occasion, said Mr Hall, to suspect that he had been wrong when refusing permission in Heilligger v Sint Maarten [2023] EWHC 422 (Admin); where he concluded at [37] that an argument similar to that advanced here “confuses legality with logistics”.  The scheme of the 2003 Act is that extradition to a “territory” means to the geographical location of that territory, not to a different territory in which it can exert its jurisdiction.
Heilligger, Mr Hall submitted, was a permission decision and, strictly, should not be cited as the judge did not give permission to cite it (see Practice Direction (Citation of Authorities) [2001] 1 WLR 1001, at [6.1]-[6.2]).  The interpretation of the statutory scheme in Heilligger is, in any case, “unheralded”, i.e. unprecedented.  Surrender to the legal custody of a territory is not the same as surrender to that territory.  Legality should precede logistics, not vice versa.
Mr Hall referred me to Lord Reid’s observation in Black-Clawson International Ltd v Papierwerke Waldhof-Aschaffenburg AG [1975] AC 591, at 613, that “[i]n the comparatively few cases where the words of a statutory provision are only capable of having one meaning, that is an end of the matter and no further enquiry is permissible. … .”
The Supreme Court had warned against impermissible glosses in Merticariu v Romania [2024] 1 WLR 1523 at [50]-[51] (per Lord Stephens JSC and Lord Burnett, in the context of retrial rights), holding that to be “entitled” to a retrial is not to be entitled to apply for a retrial.  Here the impermissible gloss was to read in the “jurisdiction” of the territory rather than to require extradition to the territory itself.  It was inescapable that the extradition sought here was to a category 1 territory (the Netherlands) not a category 2 territory (St Maarten).
Mr Hall accepted that it was open to separate jurisdictions within a sovereign state to make logistical arrangements for detention in another jurisdiction within that same state, for example because of a lack of adequate court or detention facilities.  But, he submitted, that contention of the respondent “impermissibly elides what a requesting state does - post-extradition – to what the UK has to do according to domestic legislation prior to authorising extradition”.
Mr Hall also accepted that a purposive interpretation was appropriate to avoid frustrating the process of extradition and to promote conformity between national legislation and international treaty obligations; but only where there was a genuine ambiguity in the language of the national legislation (Office of the King’s Prosecutor, Brussels v. Cando Armas [2005] 3 WLR 1079, per Lord Hope at [24]).  Here, there was none.  A foreign state’s law cannot be used to “reverse engineer” the meaning of the 2003 Act.
The position was different in In re Ismail [1999] 1 AC 320, on which the respondent relies, said Mr Hall.  There, the issue was the meaning of the word “accused” in section 1 of the 1989 Act; a term that was undefined in that Act.  The court had to decide and understandably adopted a broad and generous construction.  In the case of a requesting “territory”, also undefined in the 2003 Act, the Secretary of State, not the court, decides what are the territories to which a person may be extradited, by designating them.
In support of the appellant’s construction, Mr Hall pointed to what he said were a number of anomalies and difficulties that would arise if the respondent’s construction were adopted.  Under Part 1, the judge must order extradition “to the category 1 territory in which the warrant was issued” (sections 21(3) and 21A(5)) if that is compatible with the requested person’s Convention rights.  The same words are used where the Supreme Court allows an appeal by the requesting state (section 33(5) and (7)).
Under Parts 1 and 2, a person can only consent to extradition “to the category 1 territory in which the warrant was issued” (section 45(1)); or “to the category 2 territory to which his extradition is requested” (section 127(1)).  Under Part 2, the Secretary of State can only certify a request where there is a statement that “the request is made with a view to his arrest and extradition to the category 2 territory for the purpose of being prosecuted for the offence” or for the purpose of being sentenced (section 70(4) and (4A)).
Under Part 2, Mr Hall pointed out, the Secretary of State may order the person’s discharge where the person has been granted leave to enter or remain in the UK “on the ground that it would be a breach of Article 2 or 3 of the Human Rights Convention to remove the person to the territory to which extradition is requested” (section 93(6A)(b)).  Such human rights concerns, he said, would not be relevant if the requested person were to be sent to a different territory.
In similar vein, Mr Hall complained that the specialty provisions in the 2003 Act would be unworkable if the respondent’s construction were adopted.  Where a person is extradited to a category 2 territory, he can only be prosecuted for an offence committed before his extradition took place if the law in the requesting state provides that “he is first given an opportunity to leave the territory” (section 95(3)(b)).  It is impossible to leave a territory one has never entered.
Further, Mr Hall submitted, under Part 2 the Secretary of State can accept an undertaking from a category 2 territory that a serving UK prisoner who is to be extradited to be prosecuted in the category 2 territory will “be kept in custody until the conclusion of the proceedings against him for the offence and any other offence in respect of which he is permitted to be dealt with in the category 2 territory” (section 119(3)(a)).  That envisages the requested person being in custody in the requesting territory itself, not a different territory.
Finally, says Mr Hall, under Part 2 “[i]f … the person has made an asylum claim (whether before or after the making of the request), the person must not be extradited in pursuance of the request before the asylum claim is finally determined” (section 121(3)(b)).  An asylum complaint based on a risk of persecution in, say, St Maarten would not be relevant if the complainant was to be sent not there but to a different jurisdiction where the perceived risk of persecution could be very different.
In oral argument, I asked whether the abuse of process would be cured if the appellant were flown to St Maarten and stepped on the tarmac at the airport there, before being flown on to the Netherlands.  Mr Hall answered that it would depend on the facts; there could well be an abuse if the trip to St Maarten were no more than a sham ritual.  He accepted that a professed intent pre-extradition to effect post-extradition outsourcing of detention or trial facilities may mean human rights concerns in more than one territory have to be addressed.
In response to an invitation from me to add any brief written submissions based on the language of the ECE, Mr Hall pointed out that most of the countries to which the Part 2 territories relate are not parties to the ECE.  The latter cannot be relevant to the operation of the 2003 Act for the many non-ECE Part 2 territories.  The 2003 Act is a “reformed, radically changed scheme … [it] created a new extradition regime” (R. (Norris) v. Secretary of State for the Home Department [2006] EWHC 280 (Admin), per Sir Igor Judge P at [25]).
Further, under the ECE, the Contracting Parties are sovereign states; the ECE applies to their “metropolitan territories” (article 27(1)) and they have power themselves to delineate the territory to which the ECE applies; whereas in the 2003 Act the Secretary of State alone decides which Part 2 territories are designated.  Thus, it was the Kingdom, not the Secretary of State, that decided the ECE’s territorial application should extend to Curaçao, Sint Maarten, Bonaire, Sint Eustatius, Saba, the (former) Netherlands Antilles and Aruba.
The 2003 Act is domestic legislation while the ECE is an international treaty.  They are two different instruments.  However, the term “territory” in the ECE, on a natural reading, refers like the 2003 Act to the geographical territory and does not have any political or jurisdictional connotation.  The same reasoning applies, in the case of Part 1 territories, to any equivalence between Part 1 of the 2003 Act and the Framework Decision (and later the TACA provisions).
Summary of Respondent's Submissions
Mr Caldwell made the following main points.  He did not take issue with the existence and scope of the abuse of process jurisdiction, as explained in the cases cited by Mr Hall, which I have already mentioned.  Mr Caldwell submitted that there was no possible abuse here because the proposed arrangements did not violate the 2003 Act: the appellant’s physical removal to and detention in the Netherlands and Aruba, while remaining under the jurisdiction of St Maarten, is extradition to the territory of the latter.
Mr Caldwell referred to authorities that spoke eloquently for, he submitted, a broad, generous, purposive interpretation of “territory” in the 2003 Act.  The law of extradition is, Lord Russell of Killowen CJ said in R v. Arton (No. 1) [1896] 1 QB 108,  at p.111):
“founded upon the broad principle that it is to the interest of civilised communities that crimes acknowledged as such should not go unpunished and it is part of the comity of nations that one State should afford to another every assistance towards bringing persons guilty of such crimes to justice.”
A “liberal interpretation”, he added in R. v. Arton (No. 2) [1896] 1 QB 509, at p.517, “means no more than that they should receive their true construction according to their language, object and intent”.
An extradition treaty is “a contract between two sovereign states” and should not be “construed as though it were a domestic statute” (per Lord Widgery CJ in R. v. Governor of Ashford Remand Centre, ex p. Beese [1973] 1 WLR 969, at p.973B-C).  The court should not, “unless constrained by the language used, interpret any extradition treaty in a way which would hinder the working and narrow the operation of most salutary international arrangements” (in the words of Lord Russell in Arton (No. 2), at p.517).
These propositions have strongly influenced decisions on the interpretation of the Extradition Act 1989 and, later, the 2003 Act; see Lord Steyn’s speech in In re Ismail [1999] 1 AC 320, at pp.326H-327A, on the meaning of “accused” in the 1989 Act; Lord Hope’s judgment in Office of the King's Prosecutor Brussels v Cando Armas [2005] 3 WLR 1079 at [24] and [40], on the meaning of “conduct” in the 2003 Act; and Ouseley J’s judgment (Laws LJ agreeing) in Welsh v. Secretary of State for the Home Department [2007] 1 WLR 1281, at [236]-[137], on speciality arrangements in the 2003 Act.
Advocating the same approach to the scope of a “territory” in the 2003 Act, Mr Caldwell submitted that while the Secretary of State may choose to designate any territory by its name or by description, it is intrinsic to the concept of a designated territory and, indeed, is its defining characteristic, that it must enjoy legal sovereignty, such that its own law is applicable to the case against the requested person and it is able to exercise autonomous jurisdiction in the case.
The power to designate territories is not limited to states with international legal personality, nor to territories which exercise territorial sovereignty within their geographical boundaries, he submitted.  The international legal order has moved on from the paradigm case of a requesting state seeking extradition of a person from another state (as described by Lord Bingham CJ in R. v. Bow Street Stipendiary Magistrate, ex p. Pinochet Ugarte [1998] 4 LRC 628, at 641).
Mr Caldwell suggested, in answer to a query from the court, that designation of a territory not exercising sovereign legal jurisdiction over the case at issue could be ultra vires.  I noted in that regard that among the territories designated under Part 2 of the 2003 Act is the British Antarctic Territory which, so far as I am aware, does not have its own law and does not exercise sovereign jurisdiction.  I doubt whether there has ever been a case of extradition to or from that particular territory; its unusual status is probably no more than a curiosity.
Mr Caldwell submitted that the Secretary of State would be well aware, when designating small island territories, that often they do not have their own trial court facilities or detention facilities.  So far as the Caribbean OCTs of the Kingdom are concerned, that is evidently the case; and it is no coincidence, said Mr Caldwell, that that Secretary of State has chosen to designate those OCTs in a manner that mirrors the way in which the Kingdom has historically chosen to order the participation of its OCTs in the ECE arrangements.
It was not unusual, said Mr Caldwell, for detainees to be transferred between territories of a sovereign state; as where, by section 41 of and Schedule 1 to the Crime (Sentences) Act 1997, a prisoner is transferred within the British Isles or to the Channel Islands.  The extradition from Libya to the Netherlands of Abdelbaset al-Megrahi, prosecuted in the Netherlands under Scots law in a court constituted under the law of Scotland, shows how flexible effective extradition arrangements can be (albeit in that case under special arrangements provided for by an Order in Council (Footnote: 3)).
Once it is understood that there is no principled objection to trial and sentence in a different physical location from that of the requesting territory, where the law of the requesting territory is applied and its jurisdiction is exercised, the remaining considerations are merely logistics.  The extradition of a person is complete when he is surrendered to the custody of officials representing the requesting territory (Seprey-Hozo v. Law Court of Miercuria Ciuc, Romania [2016] 4 WLR 181, Cranston J).
Any assurances given by the requesting territory about pre-trial detention arrangements, the mode and location of trial and the arrangements for any sentence to be served are accepted and not susceptible to challenge without good reasons.  There is a “fundamental assumption that the requesting state is acting in good faith” (per Kennedy LJ in Serbeh v. Governor of HMP Brixton [2002] EWHC 2356 (Admin) at [40]).
It follows, submitted Mr Caldwell, that the reasoning of Chamberlain J in Heilligger, at [37]-[38] is correct and should be followed.  He pointed out that many of the smaller Part 2 territories do not have their own trial and detention facilities and it would be impossible to extradite anyone to them if “territory” referred to their physical boundaries rather than their legal jurisdiction.  As long as the requested person is sent to a place where he will be subject to the jurisdiction of the courts of the requesting territory, there is no abuse.
The respondent says the provisions of the 2003 Act referring to a “territory” and said by the appellant to bear the geographical meaning of the word, work just as well if its juridical sense is preferred, giving it a purposive meaning to promote comity between nations and effective extradition arrangements.  For example, a person can “consent” (section 45(1) and section 127(1)) to be extradited to the legal custody and jurisdiction of the requesting “territory”.
The appellant’s reliance on section 121(3)(b) of the 2003 Act, preventing extradition until a final decision on asylum has been made, is misplaced, said Mr Caldwell.  Any asylum decision would have to include consideration of the treatment to which the requested person would be subject in any and all his likely destinations.  That is equally the position where the Secretary of State extradites the person to the physical requesting territory but knows it intends to transfer the person onwards, post-extradition, for detention or trial elsewhere.
As for the specialty arrangements (section 95(3)(b)), while it is indeed impossible to leave a geographical territory one has never entered, in a case such as the present, if there was any proposal to try a person for an offence allegedly committed prior to the extradition offence, either the UK would have to consent to that course; or, if it did not, his release from detention would have to be directed by St Maarten so that he could leave the Kingdom; or, alternatively, he would have to be taken to St Maarten and then given the opportunity to leave.
Invited by the court to make any additional observations on the relevance, if any, of the ECE and the language of the provisions, Mr Caldwell submitted that the ECE does not affect the meaning of “territory” in Part 2 of the 2003 Act and in the designation orders; but it does help to explain (taken together with the rest of the history) the historical reasons why the Secretary of State decided to designate the Netherlands in Europe as a Part 1 territory and its OCTs in the Caribbean as separate Part 2 territories.
Reasoning and Conclusions
It is unnecessary to discuss the scope of the jurisdiction to stay extradition proceedings as an abuse of process.  The parties raised no issue in the appeal that would require consideration of that question.  Applying the reasoning in the authorities on abuse of process cited by the appellant, I agree that it would be unlawful to extradite a requested person to a territory other than that of the requesting territory; to do so would amount to what is often called “rendition”.
The appeal turns on the meaning of the words “extradited to the territory”.  I will refer to the appellant’s proposed construction as the geographical interpretation and to the respondent’s proposed construction as the juridical interpretation.  The essence of the disagreement is that the appellant says the geographical interpretation is the only linguistically permissible one; while the respondent says the juridical interpretation is tenable and must be preferred for reasons of comity and to promote the purpose of facilitating extradition.
Is the geographical interpretation the only permissible one as a matter of language?  The primary provision in Part 2 cases is section 93(4).  The Secretary of State must, if the relevant conditions are met, order that the person be “extradited to the territory to which his extradition is requested”.  The equivalent provisions in Part 1 cases are sections 21(3) and 21A(5), both stating that if none of the bars to extraditions applies the judge must order the requested person to be “extradited to the category 1 territory in which the warrant was issued”.
In my judgment, the geographical interpretation is not the only candidate as a matter of language.  After careful consideration I reject the submission that this case is within the class identified by Lord Reid in Black-Clawson, where the words are “only capable of having one meaning, that is an end of the matter and no further enquiry is permissible”.  The concept of a territory is undeniably geographical, but the act of extraditing a person is a legal act which, in my judgment, describes more than physical transport of the person to the location.
I accept that the words “extradited to the territory” are capable of meaning, as Mr Caldwell submits, delivering the requested person into the hands of agents of the requesting territory.  It is therefore permissible to look into the context and purpose of the provisions in the 2003 Act to determine whether the juridical interpretation is viable and should be preferred.  The appellant, rightly, did not quarrel with the proposition that a purposive construction is appropriate if, contrary to his primary submission, it is sustainable as a matter of language.
I would be inclined to accept the juridical interpretation if it is viable.  If it is correct, performance of the UK’s international obligations is facilitated and promoted rather than hindered and undermined.  Extradition to territories without adequate trial or detention facilities would remain feasible.  The 2003 Act is the instrument that gives effect in domestic law to those obligations.  The geographical interpretation is inconvenient because it restricts the manner and conditions in which extradition can be carried out.
The question then becomes whether the other provisions in the 2003 Act on which Mr Hall relies, are incompatible with the juridical interpretation.  In my judgment, they are not.  The judge’s duty to order extradition “to the category 1 territory in which the warrant was issued” (sections 21(3) and 21A(5)) if that is compatible with the requested person’s Convention rights, is consistent with either of the two interpretations.
The same is true of the provisions on consent to extradition to the requesting territory (section 45(1) in Part 1 cases and section 127(1) in Part 2 cases).  A person may consent to be transported to a location; or, the person may consent to be delivered up into the custody of agents of the territory in accordance with its laws for the purpose of standing trial or to serve a sentence in accordance with its laws, which may permit trial or service of the sentence elsewhere.
Mr Hall relied, as I have said, also on section 93(6A)(b), stating that the Secretary of State may order discharge where the person has been granted leave to enter or remain in the UK “on the ground that it would be a breach of Article 2 or 3 of the Human Rights Convention to remove the person to the territory to which extradition is requested”.  It is true, as Mr Hall points out, that on the juridical interpretation, the breach could occur outside the requesting territory’s geographical boundaries.
The Secretary of State would have to consider that issue, if the juridical interpretation is correct.  But the issue is no different applying the geographical interpretation.  On that interpretation (and absent any “sham” return) the requested person may be transported to the requesting territory and thence removed to the location of the trial or sentence.  That is not per se unlawful.  The Secretary of State, therefore, may have to consider human rights concerns in more than one location, whichever interpretation is correct.
I consider next the specialty provisions in (for Part 2 cases) section 95 of the 2003 Act.  The equivalent provision in Part 1 is section 17.  I accept that to have “an opportunity to leave the territory” more naturally means an opportunity to depart from it in a physical sense, than to cease being subject to its law and jurisdiction.  In a case such as this, where the requested person will not be physically present in the requesting territory until after the end of the criminal process, leaving the “territory” would have to mean leaving its jurisdiction.
Although that is a somewhat strained construction, I have concluded that in the particular context it is acceptable to construe sections 95 and 17 as including a case where the requested person cannot physically depart from the requesting territory – not having set foot there – but is given an opportunity to leave the location in which the requesting territory is, under the relevant arrangements, exercising jurisdiction; and to depart thence to a place where the requesting territory does not have jurisdiction over the requested person.
I do not think the provision in Part 2 relating to serving prisoners creates any difficulty in accepting the juridical interpretation of “extradited to the category 2 territory”.  The Secretary of State can accept an undertaking that a serving UK prisoner who is to be extradited to be prosecuted in the category 2 territory will “be kept in custody until the conclusion of the proceedings against him for the offence and any other offence in respect of which he is permitted to be dealt with in the category 2 territory” (section 119(3)(a)).
When that provision was enacted in 2003, parliament and the government knew the UK was party to international extradition arrangements (such as under the ECE) with territories that did not have adequate trial and detention facilities to deal with all extradited persons.  A person can be “dealt with” in a category 2 territory by means of arrangements between responsible law enforcement agents in that territory and in the different territory (such as in this case the Netherlands and Aruba) where the trial will take place and any sentence will be served.
As for the asylum provision in Part 2 cases, section 121(3)(b) provides, as Mr Hall pointed out, that “[i]f … the person has made an asylum claim … the person must not be extradited in pursuance of the request before the asylum claim is finally determined” (section 121(3)(b)).  That provision does not require the asylum claim to be founded on expected treatment in the requesting territory.  The basis of the asylum claim could be a risk of persecution in a different territory to which the requested person is expected to be taken.
For those reasons, which closely resemble those advanced by Mr Caldwell for the respondent, I prefer the juridical interpretation and I reject the geographical interpretation advocated by Mr Hall for the appellant.  I do not accept that the juridical interpretation puts an impermissible gloss on the words used in the statute; nor that it artificially “reverse engineers” the meaning of those words.  It is a tenable purposive interpretation which accords with principles of comity.
It does not matter that the Kingdom comprises several separate territories for extradition purposes.  The reasons for that are historical, as the ECE and other instruments reflecting changes to the Kingdom’s constitution show.  Many Part 1 states, including the UK, have OCTs with their own particular status, history and place within the parent country’s constitutional arrangements.  I agree with the reasoning of Chamberlain J in Heilligger and, having considered the issue in greater depth than he was able to, come to the same conclusion.
For those reasons, the decision of the Senior District Judge to send the case to the Secretary of State is upheld and the appeal is dismissed.  The parties are asked to provide a draft order in the usual way.  I am grateful to counsel for their diligent researches and well made submissions.

JUDGMENT
This judgment was delivered in public the judge has given leave for this version of the judgment to be published on condition that (irrespective of what is contained in the judgment) in any published version of the judgment the anonymity of the children and members of their family including the parties must be strictly preserved.   All persons, including representatives of the media and legal bloggers, must ensure that this condition is strictly complied with.   Failure to do so may be a contempt of court.
Mr Justice Poole :
Introduction
This appeal arises out of protracted proceedings in which the two children involved have been embroiled for several years. The Appellant father is responsible for much avoidable hostility in and out of the courtroom. He appeals against decisions made by an experienced Judge who has acquired considerable knowledge of the family over a number of hearings and who had intended to conclude the proceedings and to protect the children from further litigation for the remainder of their childhoods.
The Appellant is the father (“the Father”), an Australian who currently lives in England, and the First Respondent the mother (“the Mother”), of two boys, C and D, who are in their mid-teens (“the Children”). The Father appeals against orders made by HHJ Atkinson (“the Judge”) in the Family Court at East London on 25 April 2024, in particular:
The making of a non-molestation order (“NMO”) under the Family Law Act 1996;
The Judge’s refusal to recuse herself.
The making of a Child Arrangements Order by which the Children will have no face to face time with the Father and the Father will not be allowed to contact them at all and may only respond to contact made with him by the Children.
A s91(14) order effective during the Children’s minority.
By orders made by Ms Justice Henke, the father was given permission to appeal out of time, and the hearing before me was listed for permission to appeal with the appeal to follow, meaning that if permission were granted, the Court would hear the appeal itself.
At the hearing the Father was unrepresented but was able to rely on grounds of appeal and a skeleton argument drafted by Counsel. The Mother was unrepresented. The Guardian was also without legal representation. Shortly before the hearing the Children sought separate representation which the Guardian and parents did not oppose. I received an application, on notice, supported by detailed witness evidence from their experienced solicitor seeking permission for the Children to be separately represented and I granted the application under FPR r16.6(3)(a) having been satisfied that each child had sufficient understanding to conduct the proceedings concerned, without a litigation friend or children’s guardian. Nevertheless, in particular given that I was hearing an appeal against orders made when the Children had a guardian, I required the Guardian to continue to participate in the proceedings. At the hearing Ms Doyle of the Cafcass High Court Team appeared on behalf of the Guardian. Counsel represented the Children at the hearing.
I was invited by the Father to see the Children. Their Counsel informed the Court that the Children were ready to see me if required but that they had been advised that I would be unlikely to consider it necessary for the purposes of an appeal. I have received a position statement from Counsel for the Children which states that they are concerned that the orders made by HHJ Atkinson are disproportionate to the risks identified by the court and in particular that the NMO was made contrary to their expressed wishes and feelings and that it “makes indirect contact with their father fraught with difficulties.” The Father had included in his Appeal Bundle email correspondence from the Children to the Guardian, and the Guardian’s solicitor, in which, between them, they say, “We don’t want daddy to leave UK again, we just want it to go back to the way it was but also spend this Christmas with him. We don’t want to run away just because no one helps us… We ask daddy to help us … because mum says the courts will fix it but they never do.” They also say to the Guardian’s solicitor, “We don’t want to meet you without dad present to help us go back to the way it was…” The Children had made videos for the Court to view in which they express the wish to see their father and for arrangements to “go back” to where they were previously. In an email dated 18 November 2024 to the Guardian’s solicitor, they say “Dad says the barrister did not let our videos be seen by the judge. Is that true? If it is, why are you not working for us, as dad says we now have the power to fire you and hire someone who will work for us…”
Although I have accepted that the Children have sufficient understanding to conduct the proceedings concerned without a litigation friend or Guardian, it does not follow that I accept that they are free from influence from either parent. Given the history of this case, the Children’s communications, together with the assertion by the Father during the course of his submissions at the appeal hearing that he has taken to using secret signals when communicating with the Children, clearly give rise to serious concerns about his continuing influence over them.
I declined to meet the Children. This is an appeal, not a re-hearing. I have viewed the videos as part of the evidence relevant to the decision whether to permit the Children to conduct the proceedings before me without a litigation friend or Guardian. A judicial meeting with the Children could not have been for the purpose of gathering evidence as to their wishes and feelings. I considered it unwise to meet them because their expectations might very well have been that the meeting was an opportunity for them to express their wishes and feelings. They are now represented and they have had ample opportunity to put their case through Counsel.
I indicated at the outset of the hearing that although the hearing was listed for determination of permission to appeal with the appeal to follow if required, I would hear full submissions from each party relevant to both permission and the substantive appeal. The parents are litigants in person and it would have caused them difficulty to proceed in a staged way at the hearing. Nevertheless, I have to consider whether to grant permission to appeal in respect of each ground of appeal and only if permission is granted, to consider the substantive appeal in respect of each relevant ground.
Counsel had drafted the Father’s grounds of appeal which are:
“Non-Molestation Order
The Court was wrong to make the NMO in that: (a) there was serious procedural irregularity, in that F had no notice and there was no opportunity given for F to apply to vary or set-aside the order, and (b) the decision was substantively wrong, in that: (i) it should not have been made ex parte; (ii) the order was not necessary in the circumstances of the other orders, and (iii) it was for an unjustified, and unjustifiable, duration.
Recusal
There was procedural unfairness in that the Court did not consider and give reasons on the recusal issue before the substantive judgment; there being substantive reasons for looking at the matter anew
Child arrangements order
There was procedural unfairness and/or the Court was wrong in that there was insufficient:
thought or analysis was given as to whether the children should have been separately represented, or in the alternative (b) the wishes and feelings of the children
The decision was wrong in that there was an absence of analysis about the positives of F/negatives of the order that was being made.
The decision was wrong in that the draconian outcome was outside the ambit of the Court’s discretion based on the facts.
S91(14)
The decision was wrong in that: (a) it was disproportionate to extend and increase the s91(14) from that which was ordered as part of the 2022 Order, and (b) the Court did not set out what needed to be done in the future for a successful application.”
Thus the four decisions which are appealed are the NMO, the refusal to recuse, the child arrangements order (“CAO”) itself, and the s91(14) order. I shall address the Grounds of Appeal in a different order from that set out by Counsel, dealing first with recusal, then the child arrangements order, the NMO, and finally the s91(14) extension. It seems to me that I should deal with recusal first because if the Judge should have recused herself then none of her other orders can stand.
Background
The Father is an Australian national, the Mother an English national. In September 2020 CAO was made in the Family Court at a time when the Father was living in Australia and the Mother and children in England. On 9 December 2022 the Judge re-considered the CAO in the light of findings she made against the Father and in relation to the Family Court Adviser’s evidence, and with the Father then living in England.
The Judge recorded what she called the salient findings on the face of her order of 9 December 2022:
Little was factually in dispute as the father accepted that he had breached the previous orders, however he was unable to provide reasonable explanations for his breaches and tried to justify his behaviour;
The father has used the court process to harass the mother;
The father has unilaterally and repeatedly sought to alter the arrangements between the parties;
The court did not find any evidence that the mother had blocked contact at any time as asserted by the father and in fact found that she has strived to support the boys’ relationship with the father;
The father’s communication with the mother was often offensive, bullying and harassing;
The father has shown that he is unable to comply with court orders, even where there are PSOs and penal notices in place;
The father has no respect for the court process or orders and at times during the hearing had no respect for the Judge or the judicial role;
The father exercised control over the mother by reducing the mother’s time with the boys without her consent;
The father was unable to accept any responsibility for his actions and sought to unreasonably blame the mother which he has not hidden from the boys, the negative exposure of which is likely to have a negative impact upon them;
The father does love the boys and they have a good relationship but he has a serious deficit in his ability to meet their emotional needs;
The father is obsessed with the pursuit of justice, which makes him act unilaterally, unreasonably and renders him unable to see the impact of that on his sons;
The father’s quest for 50/50 is just the beginning and the court considered it highly likely that his next application would be relating to the school. A 50/50 arrangement would mean he would be better placed to undermine the boy’s current schooling;
The father has involved the boys in the parental dispute, shows no remorse for doing so and has no insight into the impact of his behaviour on the boys;
At times the father’s evidence was unboundaried and frightening;
There were very few people whom the court had experienced as combative and as rude as this father, and it was frightening how his presentation could change suddenly;
The way the father seeks to resolve disputes is unilaterally, with false narrative and by gaslighting, all of which are poor examples to adolescent boys;
The mother demonstrated that she was able to promote the father and the court was satisfied she was well able to meet all of the boys’ needs;”
Nevertheless, the Judge made a CAO for the Children to live with the Mother but to spend defined time with the Father that amounted to four consecutive nights per fortnight during term time and roughly half of the school holidays.
In the same order, and for reasons set out in detail in her judgment, the Judge made an order under the Children Act 1989 s91(14) preventing the father from making any further application in relation to the children save only in respect of an application for permission to remove them from the jurisdiction for the purpose of a holiday. The order was effective until the children had concluded their GCSE’s.
Some months later the Mother brought an application to enforce the CAO. On 14 September 2024 after a two day hearing of her application, the Judge recorded the following findings in her order of that date:
“Findings
The court is satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that [the Father] has breached the order of 2023-December-9 [sic.] without reasonable excuse as follows:
On 2023-May-1 failing to return the children after a period of staying with the father in breach of paragraph 14;
At February half term 2023 and on the weekend of 13th/14th May, taking the children away within the jurisdiction and not notifying the mother of the details of the trip in breach of paragraph 11(i);
Refusing to hand the children over at [the specified place] in breach of paragraph 11(j);
Persistently communicating the arrangements for visiting through the boys in breach of paragraphs 22 and 23 of the order and by way of example as set out in the following paragraphs of the mother’s schedule of breaches at items 1,4,5,7,10,24,25,26,30,32,33,34,35,39,41,42,59,63. (schedule attached);
Having contact outside of the terms of the order by inviting the boys to visit his home outside of his allotted time. Examples of which are on 2023-March-13 (boys invited to ‘swing by’ after school); 2023-March-14 (boys invited to come over after school, 2023-March-22 (boys ‘swung by’ to collect items; 2023-March-27 (boys invited to ‘swing by’ after school), 2023-April-18 (boys invited to go out to dinner – or drop by for an hour marathon weekend); 2023-April-25 (boys invited to swing by); 25th May/ 26th May (boys invited to deviate from arrangements);
Failure to communicate through Our Family Wizard in breach of paragraph 22 of the order.
In addition, the court found that these breaches have put the children at risk of harm as follows:
The refusal of the father to return the children to [the specified place], leaving them to roam back to their mother’s home, not informing her of any changes in arrangements and fixing them with responsibility to notify her of changes has left them on occasions without an adult knowing their whereabouts and potentially at risk.
The father has continued to draw the children into his battle with the mother by:
Choosing to virtually never communicate with her or respond to her as directed or at all;
Fixing the children with responsibility for communicating changes in the arrangements;
Encouraging them to visit him outside of the agreed hours with no notice to their mother from him;
Continuing to make derogatory comments about their mother suggesting that she is the cause of the restrictions upon their contact.
On 9th August, 4 days into his extended summer holiday contact with the children, the father was so badly affected emotionally by the receipt of the case management order of 1st August, defining the breach allegations that he called a family friend to come and collect the children and return them to their mother. The incident was highly emotionally charged. There is no clarity as to what the children witnessed. They spent the next 2 days with their mother confused, emotional, highly distressed but unwilling to reveal what happened. The father made no contact with them until 4 days later.
The mother stopped direct contact whilst there were ongoing court proceedings concerned that the same might happen again. The boys have not had direct contact since but have had indirect contact by phone and through gaming with their father.”
I have read the approved transcripts of the high quality  judgments from 9 December 2022 and 14 September 2023. Shortly prior to the delivery of the judgment on 14 September 2023, the Father applied to the Judge to recuse herself. She gave an ex tempore ruling on that issue which has also been transcribed and approved and which I have read. The Judge refused to recuse herself setting out in detail the relevant legal principles and her reasons for that refusal. That judgment is, again, fully reasoned and clear.
On 14 September 2023 the Judge also made the children parties to the proceedings and appointed a rule 16.4 Guardian.
The Father did not appeal any of the orders made on 9 December 2022 and 14 September 2023.
At a directions hearing on 29 January 2024, which the Father did not attend notwithstanding that he had been given notice of the hearing, the Judge recorded on the face of her Order that,
“.. .the court notes from reading the father’s documents submitted late, the last being submitted on the morning of the hearing, that the father may be seeking to make a further application for HHJ Atkinson to recuse herself from hearing this matter. If the father issues such application it will be dealt with at the final hearing, the court not being in a position to consider this today in light of the very late production of the father’s documents and the fact of his non attendance at today’s hearing.”
In fact, no formal application for the Judge to recuse herself was made by the Father.
Then on 23 and 25 April 2024 the Judge conducted a final hearing in the Children Act proceedings. Again, I have read the approved transcript of the Judgment delivered on 25 April 2024. The Mother appeared in person, unrepresented. The Father was then living in Australia. He did not attend the hearing and the Judge recorded in her judgment, “He has not engaged in the proceedings since October of last year when he left the country and returned to his native Australia.” The Judge noted, however, that the Father was planning imminently to return to live in England. A link had been set up for the Father to attend the hearing remotely but he did not use it. The Judge proceeded in his absence. No issue is taken in this appeal about her decision to do so.
The Father had himself provided written evidence to the Court but, the Judge recorded, he had “refused to attend the hearings, largely because I have not responded to his second application that I should recuse myself, but nor has he been prepared to attend this hearing to hear my determination of even that issue.” The Father had not made a formal application for the Judge to recuse herself but instead  had written repeatedly to the Court stating that she should do so. He has said in his Appellant’s Notice, “I do not make 17 separate recusal request lightly…” Notwithstanding the absence of a formal application, the Judge dealt with the Father’s case that she should recuse herself in her judgment of 25 April 2024, again refusing to recuse herself. She considered that the Father had not identified any new grounds for recusal arising after her September 2023 decision not to recuse herself.
The Father had also heavily criticised the children’s guardian, Mr A. The Father had written, “I withdraw my support for Mr A to act as [the Children’s] Guardian and to ever speak with them again.” The Judge, however, noted Mr A’s experience and detailed reports and she relied heavily on his evidence. In his first two meetings with the Children in October 2023 they had been closed and tearful. C said that “he would like things to go back to normal and he considered it was normal when they all lived together as a family”. Mr A noted that C was very distressed by thinking about this. On the second visit, D came into the room and immediately put his face in his hands. He was in tears and could not answer questions. A third visit, made over a month after the Father had left for Australia, the boys were more relaxed but, again D cried when asked whether he was worried about his father. C was taciturn and walked out of the meeting.
In her April 2024 judgment, the Judge addressed the issue of separate representation and noted that the Children had “not asked that their views should be separately represented by their solicitor despite knowing what the recommendations of their Guardian have been.”
At paragraph 48 of her April 2024 judgment, the Judge recorded,
“The Guardian’s assessment of this situation was that these boys are suffering significant emotional distress because of the controlling behaviour of their father.  The controlling behaviour identified by me in my findings in the Dec 2022 judgment and again in the Sept 2023 judgment have in his view impacted the mother’s approach to parenting and restricted the boys’ freedom to be able to express themselves. He highlights their ‘perceived need to withhold information’ as a ‘powerful indication that they do not feel safe to openly express themselves’ and he points to the events of August 2023 as an example of this reminding me that this was something that was so powerful that they ‘well up with emotion at the mention of August 2023 and they are unable, even now, to discuss it any further’
The Judge continued at paragraph 49:
“The Guardian comments that their views that their mother is the unfair parent, should be considered in light of their father’s controlling behaviours and observes that neither child presented the idea to him with any conviction.  It is also significant that neither objected to the recommendations in the report of no face-to-face contact at the meeting related above. In the Guardian’s view, they understand the reality more than they want to verbalise and that is extremely challenging and harmful for them.  It impacts their ability to be fully transparent with their mother, and that chimes with my findings in previous judgments. The father’s controlling behaviours, he says, must be considered in the context of domestic abuse.  He identifies that if these behaviours do not abate, then those are ongoing risks for the children.  Risks would be reduced by [the Father] developing his insight into his behaviours, but that seems unlikely given the position that he has adopted throughout.”
The Judge accepted the Guardian’s evidence and analysis. She took into account all the evidence when doing so. She concluded at paragraph 74 of her judgment of April 2024:
“I agree with the Guardian that these boys are the victims of domestic abuse themselves. It is easier for them to say that they want to see him 50/50 because then there is no backlash. Children and young people can be direct victims of coercive control and they can experience it in much the same way as adults do, feeling confused and afraid, living constrained lives and being entrapped and harmed by the perpetrator. There is clear evidence that the false narrative peddled around fairness, for example, by the father has resulted in the children verbalising an inaccurate and distorted view of their mother. Their willingness to suffer their father’s behaviour, his anger, not telling us about what happened in August, is no different to the situation in which the adult victims of domestic abuse find themselves.  Excusing the perpetrator’s behaviour, persuading themselves that it is not that bad and it can be tolerated, and for these boys it must be tolerated because it is the only way that they get to see their dad, who they love.  These are the risks that present if we move to the father’s regime of a 50/50 division.  The boys may feel that a 50/50 division will bring them some sort of peace but I am satisfied, as I was in Dec 2022, that this would be momentary because I am quite clear that his campaign will not stop with a 50/50 division.”
The Judge’s reference to “what happened in August” was to an incident on 9 August 2023. The boys had been spending time with the Father in accordance with defined arrangements. They were due to spend more days with him but, as the Father conceded in the September 2023 hearing, he had felt “overwhelmed by the proceedings”. He effectively rejected the boys and had no contact with them for four days. They returned to the Mother who reported that they were very distressed. They have still not spoken openly about what happened that day.
The Judge continued at paragraph 75 of her April 2024 judgment:
“The Guardian proposes the only other alternative. That is to stop face to face contact between the father and the children and limit indirect contact to only that which is initiated by them.  Stopping face to face contact is a very draconian step and has troubled me.  The children have powerful feelings for their father. That was why I left the contact in place.  But [the Father] has abused this from the moment the order was made, because it was not what he wanted. The risks to their emotional wellbeing posed by their father would support a recommendation that there should be no contact at all but [the Guardian] recognises the strength of their feeling and also the need to enable them to become the arbiters of how and when they see him.”
The Judge then considered the pros and cons of the proposal but ultimately concluded that the cessation of face to face contact was in the best interests of each of the Children. She also determined that the Children could, as and when they wish, contact their Father by telephone or electronic communications but he could not contact them otherwise than in response. She recognised the risk that he would nevertheless seek to manipulate them through such contact.
The Judge further determined that the existing s91(14) order should be extended during their minority because “these children need peace. The father, although he is not ostensibly engaging in these proceedings … is perpetuating them… He is weaponizing them in order to undermine the mother’s parenting of the boys, and using the opportunity visit more turmoil on them in so doing.”
At the end of her judgment, after prompting by Counsel, the Judge gave reasons for refusing the father’s application to her to recuse herself. She recorded that she would, again, write to the Children, which she subsequently did.
The Law on Appeal
By the Family Procedure Rules 2010 r30.3(7):
“Permission to appeal may be given only where –
the court considers that the appeal would have a real prospect of success; or
there is some other compelling reason why the appeal should be heard.”
FPR 30.12(3) provides that an appeal may be allowed where either the decision was wrong or it was unjust for serious procedural or other irregularity. The court may conclude a decision is wrong because of an error of law, because a conclusion was reached on the facts which was not open to the judge on the evidence, because the judge clearly failed to give due weight to some significant matter or clearly gave undue weight to some other matter, or because the judge exercised a discretion which ""exceeds the generous ambit within which reasonable disagreement is possible, and is, in fact, plainly wrong"": G v G (Minors: Custody Appeal) [1985] FLR 894.
The appellate court must consider the judgment under appeal as a whole. In Re F (Children) [2016] EWCA Civ 546 Munby P summarised the approach as follows:
Like any judgment, the judgment of the Deputy Judge has to be read as a whole, and having regard to its context and structure. The task facing a judge is not to pass an examination, or to prepare a detailed legal or factual analysis of all the evidence and submissions he has heard. Essentially, the judicial task is twofold: to enable the parties to understand why they have won or lost; and to provide sufficient detail and analysis to enable an appellate court to decide whether or not the judgment is sustainable. The judge need not slavishly restate either the facts, the arguments or the law…
The task of this court is to decide the appeal applying the principles set out in the classic speech of Lord Hoffmann in Piglowska v Piglowski [1999] 1 WLR 1360. I confine myself to one short passage (at 1372):
""The exigencies of daily court room life are such that reasons for judgment will always be capable of having been better expressed. This is particularly true of an unreserved judgment such as the judge gave in this case … These reasons should be read on the assumption that, unless he has demonstrated the contrary, the judge knew how he should perform his functions and which matters he should take into account. This is particularly true when the matters in question are so well known as those specified in section 25(2) [of the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973]. An appellate court should resist the temptation to subvert the principle that they should not substitute their own discretion for that of the judge by a narrow textual analysis which enables them to claim that he misdirected himself.""
It is not the function of an appellate court to strive by tortuous mental gymnastics to find error in the decision under review when in truth there has been none. The concern of the court ought to be substance not semantics. To adopt Lord Hoffmann's phrase, the court must be wary of becoming embroiled in ""narrow textual analysis"".
The appellate court should be slow to interfere with findings of fact. As Lewison LJ said in Fage UK Ltd & Anor v Chobani UK Ltd & Anor [2014] EWCA Civ 5, at paras114 to 115:
""Appellate courts have been repeatedly warned, by recent cases at the highest level, not to interfere with findings of fact by trial judges, unless compelled to do so. This applies not only to findings of primary fact, but also to the evaluation of those facts and to inferences to be drawn from them….The reasons for this approach are many. They include,
The expertise of a trial judge is in determining what facts are relevant to the legal issues to be decided, and what those facts are if they are disputed.
The trial is not a dress rehearsal. It is the first and last night of the show.
Duplication of the trial judge's role on appeal is a disproportionate use of the limited resources of an appellate court, and will seldom lead to a different outcome in an individual case.
In making his decisions the trial judge will have regard to the whole of the sea of evidence presented to him, whereas an appellate court will only be island hopping.
The atmosphere of the courtroom cannot, in any event, be recreated by reference to documents (including transcripts of evidence).
Thus even if it were possible to duplicate the role of the trial judge, it cannot in practice be done.
It is also important to have in mind the role of a judgment given after trial. The primary function of a first instance judge is to find facts and identify the crucial legal points and to advance reasons for deciding them in a particular way. He should give his reasons in sufficient detail to show the parties and, if need be, the Court of Appeal the principles on which he has acted and the reasons that have led him to his decision. They need not be elaborate. There is no duty on a judge, in giving his reasons, to deal with every argument presented by counsel in support of his case. His function is to reach conclusions and give reasons to support his view, not to spell out every matter as if summing up to a jury. Nor need he deal at any length with matters that are not disputed. It is sufficient if what he says shows the basis on which he has acted.""
More recently Lewison LJ set out the principles to be applied again in Volpi and ors v Volpi [2022] EWCA Civ 464 at [2], principles cited by Baker LJ in T (Fact-Finding: Second Appeal) [2023] EWCA Civ 475:
An appeal court should not interfere with the trial judge's conclusions on primary facts unless it is satisfied that he was plainly wrong.
The adverb ""plainly"" does not refer to the degree of confidence felt by the appeal court that it would not have reached the same conclusion as the trial judge. It does not matter, with whatever degree of certainty, that the appeal court considers that it would have reached a different conclusion. What matters is whether the decision under appeal is one that no reasonable judge could have reached.
An appeal court is bound, unless there is compelling reason to the contrary, to assume that the trial judge has taken the whole of the evidence into his consideration. The mere fact that a judge does not mention a specific piece of evidence does not mean that he overlooked it.
The validity of the findings of fact made by a trial judge is not aptly tested by considering whether the judgment presents a balanced account of the evidence. The trial judge must of course consider all the material evidence (although it need not all be discussed in his judgment). The weight which he gives to it is however pre-eminently a matter for him.
An appeal court can therefore set aside a judgment on the basis that the judge failed to give the evidence a balanced consideration only if the judge's conclusion was rationally insupportable.
Reasons for judgment will always be capable of having been better expressed. An appeal court should not subject a judgment to narrow textual analysis. Nor should it be picked over or construed as though it was a piece of legislation or a contract.""
Recusal
The Legal Framework
I was not referred to the Court of Appeal decision in AZ (A Child) (Recusal) [2022] EWCA Civ 911 but it contains a very helpful summary of the law relating to recusal. At paragraph 54 the Court of Appeal noted:
“As Hildyard J observed in M&P Enterprises (London) Ltd v Norfolk Square (Northern Section) Ltd [2018] EWHC 2665 (Ch) at paragraph 16:
""The right to a fair trial, both under the common law and Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights (the House of Lords in Lawal v Northern Spirit Limited [2003] UKHL 35 having confirmed that there is no difference between the requirements in each) includes the right to a trial and decision conducted and made by a decision-maker free not only from actual bias but also from the appearance of bias. Justice must both be fair and be seen to be fair.""
The Court of Appeal endorsed the observations of Leggatt LJ in Bubbles & Wine Ltd v Lusha [2018] EWCA Civ 468 where he said at [17]:
""The court must first ascertain all the circumstances which have a bearing on the suggestion that the judge was biased. It must then ask whether those circumstances would lead a fair-minded and informed observer to conclude that there was a real possibility that the judge was biased: see Porter v Magill [2001] UKHL 67; [2002] 2 AC 357, paras 102-103.""
The Court of Appeal observed that there is a degree of overlap between general unfairness and apparent bias, before setting out ten points relevant to the appeal with which it was concerned:
The overriding objective in Part 1 of the Family Procedure Rules 2010 requires a judge ""to deal with cases justly, having regard to any welfare issues involved."" The Rules require active judicial case management and so family judges are expected to intervene in proceedings to a far greater extent than in earlier times.
The child’s welfare is the court’s paramount consideration and “children’s proceedings are, for the most part, quasi-inquisitorial rather than adversarial.”
Apparent bias is an area of the law which requires an intense focus on the essential facts of the case.
The fair-minded and informed observer will adopt a “balanced approach” and is “neither complacent nor unduly sensitive or suspicious.”
It is necessary to consider the proceedings as a whole in engaging in the objective assessment of whether there is a real possibility that the tribunal was biased.
Bias means prejudice against one party or its case for reasons unconnected with the merits of the case.
The mere fact that the Judge had, earlier in the case, commented adversely on a party or witness or had found their evidence to be unreliable would not without more found a sustainable objection. But if there was room for doubt, that doubt should be resolved in favour of recusal.
A Judge should not prematurely express conclusions suggesting a closed mind, but does not act amiss if they indicate scepticism or the need for particularly compelling evidence to persuade them of a fact.
If a fair-minded and informed observer, having considered the facts, would not conclude that there is a real possibility that the tribunal will be biased, then the objection to the judge must fail even if that leaves the objecting party with a sense of injustice.
Litigants can usually be expected to cope with different judicial approaches and styles provided judicial behaviour does not stray outside acceptable limits.
Here, in his oral submissions, the Father asserts both actual bias and an appearance of bias. In his written grounds and skeleton, prepared by Counsel, the only point taken on the recusal decision is that of “procedural unfairness in that the Court did not consider and give reasons on the recusal issue before the substantive judgment there being substantive reasons for looking at the matter anew.”
Application for Recusal and Judge’s Determination
The Father had previously applied for the Judge to recuse herself, in response to which the Judge had delivered a 42 paragraph ruling on 14 September 2023, the transcript of which I have read, lengthened due to interruptions by the Father whose final remark was that “You’re judge, jury and executioner, this is not the way democracy works.” In that ruling, HHJ Atkinson properly set out the law on recusal and applied it to the application. The Father did not appeal that ruling but shortly before the next hearing, in January 2024, he wrote a lengthy letter to the Court to the effect that the Judge should recuse herself. He made a number of points in his letter but in substance his one point was that the Judge was biased against him and had already determined that he should be excluded from the Children’s lives. He also maintained that the Guardian was involved in a similar campaign against him.
In his submissions to me, the Father went so far as to assert that Cafcass is institutionally biased against fathers and that, in accordance with that systemic approach, the Guardian had deliberately sought to build a case against him. The Judge had been a willing participant in what amounted to a conspiracy to deprive the Father of a relationship with his children.
At the case management hearing on 29 January 2024 the Judge recorded that the Father submitted documents late which showed that he “may be seeking to make a further application for HHJ Atkinson to recuse herself from hearing this matter.” She recorded that if the Father were to issue such an application, she would deal with it at the final hearing. The Father did not issue such an application and he did not attend the final hearing for the purpose of making an application for recusal orally or for any other purpose.
At the April hearing, the Judge did not expressly address the issue of recusal at the beginning of her judgment but she said at paragraph 33:
A major theme throughout all his documents is that I should recuse myself. He made that ‘application’ in January of this year.  The father did not issue an application as such, he simply sent a statement. He did not attend to argue it.  It came on the morning of the hearing of 29th Jan, so I declined to deal with it as I had to deal with the substantive issues and then get on with my already very busy list.  Ever since, he has persistently emailed the court, my clerk, another judge in this court (a lay Magistrate), encouraging them to ensure that I am removed from the case or insisting that I consider the recusal application by a deadline he has set for me. I have declined to engage outside the formality of this hearing.  I will deal with the recusal point at the end of this judgment.  Suffice to say it adds nothing to the application that he made previously and therefore I have dismissed it.”
Then, having made her determinations on the child arrangements order, the non-molestation order, and the s91(14) extension, the Judge was reminded of the recusal issue by Counsel for the Guardian. At that point the Judge referred to a “recusal application”. She noted that there was “nothing new” in the Father’s written “reasons for recusal” when compared with the previous application. She distinguished between proper grounds for recusal and a party’s dislike of the decisions the Judge had previously made. Without reciting authority on the issue - which she had previously set out in her ruling in September 2023 -  the Judge dealt summarily with the application, finding that there were no grounds to conclude that she had demonstrated bias or that there was an appearance of bias. As noted, she had recorded her dismissal of the application to recuse herself earlier in the judgment.
Analysis and Conclusion
Although the Appellant’s grounds and skeleton argument do not assert actual bias, the Father effectively did so during his oral submissions. I can deal with that submission briefly. He has not provided any evidence at all of bias. He has not referred to any conduct or statements of the Judge outside the proceedings as a basis for the claim of actual bias, nor could actual bias be inferred from the judgments or orders the Judge had given and made prior to the hearing in April 2024. The distinction between making findings against a litigant and a Judge being prejudiced against them is obvious, but the Father’s protests of bias amount to little more than a complaint that the Judge has made findings against him. He protests that he is effectively bound by those decisions and that there is nothing that he can do about them unless or until he has a different Judge. He invited me, as a Judge new to the case, to take a “broad view” and to make a different child arrangements order. He was disappointed that I did not use further court time to re-address the CAO as though I were dealing with it at first instance. I told him that I was sitting in an appellate capacity and was bound by the rules and law relevant to appeals, but he would not accept that. Litigants cannot select the judge who is to hear their case. Subject to appeal, factual findings made are indeed binding on the parties. Naturally, the Father is frustrated that he has not persuaded the Judge of his case on various matters, but it does not follow that the Judge is prejudiced against him.
As to any assertion that there was an appearance of bias, again I need to say, for the benefit of the Father, that his mere assertion is not sufficient, however many times he makes it. He has not in fact identified any factual basis for contending that there was an appearance of bias that should have precluded the Judge for hearing the case. It is true that the Judge had made serious findings against the Father but it did not follow from that fact alone that her mind was closed in relation to any further applications, issues, and orders. The Judge’s rulings and judgments demonstrate her focus on the evidence and the best interests of the Children, and her analytical approach.
In his skeleton argument on appeal, Counsel for the Father contends that since the Father’s previous application for recusal, the Judge had ordered an interim cessation of direct contact and there had been a breakdown in communication between the Father and the Court. Furthermore the Father had been concerned that the Court was refusing to allow evidence which he considered to be admissible. I reject the suggestion that these amounted to substantial fresh grounds for a further application to recuse. The interim cessation of contact was a fully reasoned decision made after a hearing. There was no breakdown of communication, but rather a decision by the Father to disengage from proceedings other than  by sending repeated email communications to the Court and others. No appeal was made against the September orders nor against subsequent case management decisions. They were not challenged. The “new features” identified by Counsel were no more than further grievances harboured by the Father. The continuing or growing discontent of a litigant is not a proper ground for repeated recusal applications.
No fair-minded observer informed of all the relevant circumstances would have concluded that there was a real possibility that the judge was biased – that is not an arguable case in my view.
I now turn to procedural issues relating to recusal. In her case management order of 29 January 2024 the Judge had noted that no (fresh) application to recuse had been made but that if one were made, she would consider it at the final hearing. The Father took no further steps to make an application but, when reminded of the issue when giving her judgment at the final hearing, she addressed recusal as if an application had been made. This was inconsistent but it was favourable to the Father. The Judge did not dismiss the issue on the grounds that no application had been made. The procedural point taken by Counsel for the Father when drafting the grounds and skeleton on appeal, is that the Judge failed to deal with the issue of recusal at the outset of the hearing. In fact she addressed the issue at paragraph 33 of her judgment, prior to stating her conclusions on any substantive decisions, recording that “I have dismissed” the application to recuse made in January 2024. There is no substance to the Father’s case that the Judge failed to deal with the recusal application until after she had given her substantive judgment. It is fair to note that the Judge gave reasons for dismissing the recusal application at the end of her judgment, after being reminded by Counsel of the issue, but those were her reasons, not her decision. In any event, the Judge was perfectly entitled to decide to proceed with the hearing and to give her reasons for doing so later.
Judges in family cases often have unrepresented parties appearing before them. One or more of those parties may become very unhappy with decisions made by the judge during the course of proceedings. Naturally, such litigants may wish to change the Judge, but it is recognised as important to maintain judicial continuity where possible and it would be unjust and unfair to the other parties and the children involved to change the judge just because one party did not agree with the judge’s previous findings and decisions. The great majority of litigants in person accept the court’s decisions but sometimes a family judge receives repeated entreaties by an aggrieved litigant in person to recuse themselves. As HHJ Atkinson did, it is good practice to make a formal ruling on an initial application. However, repeated applications can disrupt proceedings and cause delay unless properly managed. The court may properly decide, as here, to require a formal application to be made before they consider a repeat application to recuse.
Here, the Judge did in fact consider the repeat application and dealt with it firmly, but with reasons. There was no need for her to set out once again the law on recusal because she had done so in detail in a previous ruling. She was entitled to deal with the repeat application in summary fashion, in particular since the Father had not troubled to attend the hearing to pursue the application.
The Judge clearly reached the correct decision to refuse to recuse herself. There was no procedural irregularity rendering the decision unfair or unjust. There is no real prospect of success on the appeal on this ground and no other compelling reason why the appeal on this ground should be heard. Permission to appeal on this ground is refused.
The Child Arrangements Order
The Legal Framework
Children Act 1989 (CA 1989) s8 defines a child arrangements order as meaning an order regulating arrangements relating to with whom a child is to live, spend time or otherwise have contact and when a child is to live, spend time or otherwise have contact with any person. By CA 1989 s9(6):
“No court shall make a section 8 order which will end after the child has reached the age of sixteen unless it is satisfied that the circumstance of the case are exceptional.”
But s9(6) does not apply to a child arrangements order if the arrangements regulated by the order relate only to either or both of the following: “(a) with whom the child concerned is to live, and (b) when the child is to live with any person.” – see CA 1989 ss6A and 6B. In the present case the child arrangements order made on 25 April 2024 did not relate only to either or both of those matters. Furthermore, the Judge did not make a section 8 order that extended beyond the Children’s 16th birthdays and did not refer to any exceptional circumstances that would justify such an extension.
By CA 1989 s91(10):
“A section 8 order shall, if it would otherwise still be in force, cease to have effect when the child reaches the age of sixteen, unless it is to have effect beyond that age by virtue of section 9(6).
CA 1989 s91(10A) disapplies s91(10) to provision in a child arrangements order regulating arrangements relating to with whom a child is to live or when the child is to live with any person. Hence the Judge’s s8 orders in respect of C and D’s face to face time and indirect contact with the Father, which the father seeks to appeal, will cease to have effect once each child is 16.
Submissions
The Father’s Grounds of Appeal and Skeleton Argument contend that the Judge gave insufficient thought or analysis as to whether the children should have been separately represented or, in the alternative, their wishes and feelings. The boys had enjoyed time with their father and there was evidence that they wanted an even division of time between their parents. They were worried about their father. Separate representation should have been considered because there appeared to be a difference between what the Children were saying to the Guardian, and their actual wishes and feelings, a discrepancy which the Father was anxious to scrutinise by way of disclosure of the Guardian’s notes of his meetings with the Children.
The Order made on 25 April 2024
The CAO was that the children shall live with their mother and that the father shall not have face to face contact with the children or contact them by telephone, video calls, online gaming, social media, WhatsApp or any other form of communication save by way of reply to a communication sent to him by either child, and then only out of school hours.
Analysis and Conclusion
The Judge acknowledged the risks involved in making her CAO for the Father to have no direct time with the Children and for indirect contact to be initiated only by the Children:
The Guardian proposes the only other alternative. That is to stop face to face contact between the father and the children and limit indirect contact to only that which is initiated by them.  Stopping face to face contact is a very draconian step and has troubled me.  The children have powerful feelings for their father. That was why I left the contact in place.  But [the Father] has abused this from the moment the order was made, because it was not what he wanted. The risks to their emotional wellbeing posed by their father would support a recommendation that there should be no contact at all but [Mr A] recognises the strength of their feeling and also the need to enable them to become the arbiters of how and when they see him.
The drawbacks of this arrangement are that it is highly likely that the father will continue to seek to influence the children into seeing him or speaking with him and no order I can make, given their ages, can prevent that.  It also leaves them having to decide when to see him – something that we usually avoid in cases involving children.  However, [Mr A] has argued a powerful case for the need for these boys to be able to develop their own agency in this situation.  They need to be able to stand up to their father and tell him if it is not convenient to see or speak to him.  If they are to develop into decent, well rounded and emotionally mature young men, they also need to recognise when their father is unfairly negative about their mother and be able to call him out or at the least ignore his comments.  That is about developing independence and the ability to speak freely.  Something that they cannot do at the moment in his presence.”
The Judge recognised that the CAO was draconian and did not coincide with the stated wishes of the Children who were of an age when their wishes and feelings carried considerable weight. Nevertheless, in a detailed judgment, which followed the earlier detailed judgments from November 2022 and September 2023, the Judge explained why she had reached her determination. In making the order she accepted the fully reasoned recommendation of the Guardian. I have already set out extracts from the judgment which referred to the exceptional conduct of the Father which, the Judge concluded, was abusive of the Children as well as the Mother, harmful to them, and likely to continue for so long as he had face to face time with the Children. This is not an ordinary case. The Father’s emotional abuse and controlling behaviour has been relentless. He either has no insight into his conduct and its effects or, worse still, he pretends to have no such insight. Whether disingenuously or not, he purports to be an ordinary, loving parent who cannot understand why he is being so unfairly victimised by the Guardian and the Judge. The CAO allowed continuing indirect contact, which has been taking place, even though the Judge had reservations about the way the Father would exploit it. Those reservations may have been well-grounded: the Father told me that he is having to use “secret signals” with the boys during his communications with them. Their video asking to spend face to face time with their father raises concerns about the Father’s continuing role in influencing them.
Reading the judgment as a whole, it is clear that this very experienced Judge had each child’s best interests as her paramount consideration and took into account all the matters and circumstances relevant to her determination of the section 8 order that served that end. I can detect no error of law and find the Judge’s mastery of the evidence and her analysis to be impressive.
The Judge expressly considered whether the Children should be separately represented, noting that no suggestion had been made to that effect by the Children. The Guardian had not raised it and the Father had not attended the hearing to argue for it. Clearly, the Judge was very concerned about the influence of the Father on the Children’s expressed views, and their wishes and feelings. She took that into account – indeed it was a matter central to her judgment. She was acutely aware that what the boys said in different circumstances to different people might not reflect their true wishes and feelings. Great care was taken by the Judge to consider the wishes and feelings of each child. There were no grounds for suspecting that the Guardian had done anything other than faithfully report his meetings with the Children. There would have been no benefit or justification at the time in separate representation, even if it had been proposed. The Court took full account of the Children’s wishes and feelings.
The Judge did recognise that the risk of harm to the Children from contact with the Father would continue through the indirect contact she allowed, but her decision to prevent face to face contact was a legitimate means of seeking to mitigate the harm to the Children. It cannot reasonably be argued that the Judge was not entitled to preclude face to face contact because she was allowing indirect contact.
The Judge accepted the recommendations of the Guardian. The Judge was very familiar with the family and history of the case. Her reasoning in her judgment was clear and comprehensive. No error of law has been identified and no procedural irregularity. I can find no merit in this ground of appeal. It has no real prospect of success and there is no other compelling reason why it should be heard on appeal. I refuse permission to appeal the child arrangements order.
Non-Molestation Order
The Legal Framework
By s42 Family Law Act 1996:
“42 Non-molestation orders.
In this Part a “non-molestation order” means an order containing either or both of the following provisions—
provision prohibiting a person ( “the respondent”) from molesting another person who is associated with the respondent;
provision prohibiting the respondent from molesting a relevant child.
The court may make a non-molestation order—
if an application for the order has been made (whether in other family proceedings or without any other family proceedings being instituted) by a person who is associated with the respondent; or
if in any family proceedings to which the respondent is a party the court considers that the order should be made for the benefit of any other party to the proceedings or any relevant child even though no such application has been made.
In subsection (2) “family proceedings” includes proceedings in which the court has made an emergency protection order under section 44 of the M1Children Act 1989 which includes an exclusion requirement (as defined in section 44A(3) of that Act).
Where an agreement to marry is terminated, no application under subsection (2)(a) may be made by virtue of section 62(3)(e) by reference to that agreement after the end of the period of three years beginning with the day on which it is terminated.
…
(4B) In this Part “the applicant”, in relation to a non-molestation order, includes (where the context permits) the person for whose benefit such an order would be or is made in exercise of the power conferred by subsection (2)(b).]
…
In deciding whether to exercise its powers under this section and, if so, in what manner, the court shall have regard to all the circumstances including the need to secure the health, safety and well-being—
of the applicant . . . ; and
of any relevant child.
A non-molestation order may be expressed so as to refer to molestation in general, to particular acts of molestation, or to both.
A non-molestation order may be made for a specified period or until further order.”
A non-molestation order which is made in other family proceedings ceases to have effect if those proceedings are withdrawn or dismissed.”
FLA 1996 s45 provides:
“45 Ex parte orders.
The court may, in any case where it considers that it is just and convenient to do so, make an occupation order or a non-molestation order even though the respondent has not been given such notice of the proceedings as would otherwise be required by rules of court.
In determining whether to exercise its powers under subsection (1), the court shall have regard to all the circumstances including—
any risk of significant harm to the applicant or a relevant child, attributable to conduct of the respondent, if the order is not made immediately;
whether it is likely that the applicant will be deterred or prevented from pursuing the application if an order is not made immediately; and
whether there is reason to believe that the respondent is aware of the proceedings but is deliberately evading service and that the applicant or a relevant child will be seriously prejudiced by the delay [F1involved] in effecting substituted service.
If the court makes an order by virtue of subsection (1) it must afford the respondent an opportunity to make representations relating to the order as soon as just and convenient at a full hearing.”
FPR Rule 4.3 states:
The court may make an order of its own initiative without hearing the parties or giving them an opportunity to make representations.
Where the court has made an order under paragraph (4) –
a party affected by the order may apply to have it set aside (GL), varied or stayed (GL); and
the order must contain a statement of the right to make such an application.
An application under paragraph (5)(a) must be made –
within such period as may be specified by the court; or
if the court does not specify a period, within 7 days beginning with the date on which the order was served on the party making the application.”
The standard template non-molestation order (template order 10.1) includes the following wording for orders concerning contact with children:
The respondent, [respondent name], must not telephone, text, email or otherwise contact or attempt to contact the relevant child[ren] (including via social networking websites or other forms of electronic messaging) [except for such contact as may be agreed in writing between the applicant and the respondent or in default of agreement ordered by the court].
The respondent, [respondent name], must not [between the hours of 8.30am and 4.00pm] go to, enter or attempt to enter the school premises known as [school name], and must not go [along the road[s] known as [road(s) name(s)]] / [anywhere within the territory of the map annexed hereto], except [by prior written agreement with the applicant] / [by prior written invitation from the school authorities].”
The President of the Family Division issued Practice Guidance on Non-molestation Injunctions in July 2023. In relation to ex parte (without notice) injunctions, paragraph 6 of the guidance states:
“The court must at all times balance the applicant’s need for protection with the need to limit interference with the respondent’s rights to that which is proportionate. Although FLA 1996 s 45 does not establish a test of exceptionality, authority at High Court level (R v R [2014] EWFC 48 and DS v AC [2023] EWFC 46) has held that a FLA order should only be made without notice to the respondent in exceptional circumstances. Orders made without notice should not have the effect of barring a respondent from their home or place of work or other necessary location without very careful consideration and specific evidence to justify such an extensive infringement of the respondent’s rights. Any order having that effect should be regarded as exceptional.”
And at paragraph 13:
“The ex parte order itself can be for a substantial period, such as 6 or even 12 months, but the return date must be listed within 28 days at most. The period of the order is a matter for the discretion of the judge, who will also want to consider how soon a fact-finding hearing is likely to be listed, if the application is contested.”
And at paragraph 19:
“An order made without notice must contain a statement of the right to make an application to set aside or vary the order under rule 18.11 in accordance with FPR 18.10(3). The phrase ‘liberty to apply’ is not sufficient for this purpose. The order must spell out that the respondent is entitled, without waiting for the return day, to apply to set aside or vary the order. If the respondent does apply to set aside or vary the order the court must list the application as a matter of urgency, within a matter of days at most.”
The Guidance also addresses the use of orders to impose an exclusion zone on the respondent. At paragraph 18, it is stated:
“If the court decides to exclude the respondent from a geographical area, the order should specify a named road or roads or a clearly defined area and avoid the use of expressions such as ‘100 metres from the applicant’s home’. The use of maps, which can become detached, should likewise be avoided unless they are embedded into the body of the order.”
The Non-Molestation Order Made on 25 April 2024
In the present case the Judge made the NMO of her own motion – there had been no application for one.  On the face of the NMO order made on 25 April 2024 the Court recorded:
“The Guardian had set out in his analysis dated 15 January 2024 at paragraph 57 his recommendation: “Given [the Father’s] multiple breaches of orders to date, I consider that a power of arrest should be added to the penal notice in respect of in-person time (physical contact) occurring in the UK. [The Father] could then be arrested without the need for [the Mother] to return the matter to Court if he were to breach the order following the conclusion of these proceedings.”
The Guardian repeated his recommendation in his addendum analysis dated 18 April 2024 at paragraph 17: “I remain of the opinion that it not safe for the boys to spend in-person time with their father, including in the event that [the Father]  returns to the UK, and that a power of arrest should be added to the penal notice in respect of this.”
The father confirms he has been given notice of the Guardian’s recommendation in his position statement dated 19 April 2024 where he refers to the Guardian’s recommendation and responds: “I state quite clearly if you seek to enact the power of arrest, I will deliberately breach an order to seek the intervention of a new judge. I am tired of being bullied and feel absolutely vilified I did not speak with this individual from cafcass.”
A power of arrest cannot be added to a CAO. A penal notice conventionally appears at the head of a CAO, as was the case with the orders made in these proceedings. Breaches of the order may result in enforcement proceedings, as also occurred here. As a last resort, contempt proceedings may be brought for breaches of CAOs with penal notices attached, but no power of arrest may be added. As is clear from the reasoning set out in her judgment of 25 April 2024 the Judge accepted the principle articulated by the Guardian that the Father should be liable to be arrested for future breaches of the Court’s CAO. She adopted, of her own motion, the mechanism of an NMO. The order reads, as relevant:
“IMPORTANT NOTICE TO THE RESPONDENT [NAME OF FATHER]
YOU MUST OBEY THIS ORDER. You should read it carefully. If you do not understand anything in this order you should go to a solicitor, Legal Advice Centre or Citizens Advice Bureau. You have a right to apply to the court to change or cancel the order.
WARNING: IF, WITHOUT REASONABLE EXCUSE, YOU DO ANYTHING WHICH YOU ARE FORBIDDEN FROM DOING BY THIS ORDER, YOU WILL BE COMMITTING A CRIMINAL OFFENCE AND LIABLE ON CONVICTION TO A TERM OF IMPRISONMENT NOT EXCEEDING FIVE YEARS OR TO A FINE OR BOTH.
ALTERNATIVELY, IF YOU DISOBEY THIS ORDER, YOU MAY BE HELD TO BE IN CONTEMPT OF COURT AND MAY BE IMPRISONED, FINED, OR HAVE YOUR ASSETS SEIZED.
The court was satisfied that [The Father]  had been provided with sufficient notice of the possibility that an order would be made against [the Father] whereby he could be arrested if he had face to face contact with either or both of his children….
Non-molestation order
[The Father] must not have in person contact with [R and/or S]
[The Father] shall not instruct or encourage anyone else to contact [R or S] on his behalf.
[The Father] must not attend the children’s school, [address stated] or their home at [address stated].
[The Father], who does not currently live in the UK, must not go within 1 mile of the children’s school {address stated] or [home address stated]
Duration of the Non-Molestation Order
Paragraphs 1- 4 of this order shall be effective against [the Father] once it is served upon him.
Permission is granted for the order to be served electronically in light of [the Father’s address being unknown and the parties being given to understand that he is in Australia currently though planning to come to the UK on 2024-May-10.
Paragraphs 1-4 of the order shall last [for the whole of the Children’s minorities].”
At paragraph 82 of her judgment the Judge explained her decision to make the NMO as follows:
My reasons are that the Guardian was quite clear that we need to end these proceedings. With that I wholeheartedly agree.  The pressure is enormous on these children and every time a hearing approaches, as demonstrated recently, [the Father] increases the pressure on the children.  It has to stop.  Making an order, as I did previously, and leaving the mother to enforce it, means that when breached she has to issue an application and come back to court.  I consider that the risks to these children are such that they justify the making of a non-molestation order.  The requirement in the order that he should not initiate contact with the children and he must not have any in-person contact is essential in order to enforce this order, and it is essential to ensure that they are kept safe from harm.  On that basis, I am justified, in my judgment, in making a non-molestation order to support the contact order and to keep the children free from harm.”
The Ground of Appeal and Submissions
The Appellant’s first ground of appeal is that:
“The Court was wrong to make the NMO in that: (a) there was serious procedural irregularity, in that F had no notice and there was no opportunity given for F to apply to vary or set-aside the order, and (b) the decision was substantively wrong, in that: (i) it should not have been made ex parte; (ii) the order was not necessary in the circumstances of the other orders, and (iii) it was for an unjustified, and unjustifiable, duration.”
The Father was living in Australia at the time when the NMO was made but was intending to return to England, as he subsequently did. He told me that he had been put in the same category as a paedophile by being made subject to arrest simply for loving his children and wanting to see them. He said that his sons wanted to see him as shown by their position statement made now that they have separate representation. In Counsel’s skeleton argument on behalf of the Father the Court is reminded that the Father was a litigant in person and it is submitted that a full hearing, or return date, was not listed, which was a procedural irregularity. The fact that no notice had been given, that there was no return date, and the duration of the order (over three years) in combination rendered the imposition of the NMO unjust. Further, the NMO was unnecessary because a penal notice was attached to the CAO.
In response, the Mother and the Guardian point to the notice given to the Father, as recorded on the face of the NMO, that consideration would be given at the April 2024 hearing to an order that would allow for the Father’s arrest for breach of the CAO. They also remind the Court of the history of repeated breaches which the Judge found, as she noted at paragraph 15 of her judgment of 25 April 2024:
“… evidence an almost pathological inability in the father to comply with an order with which he did not agree.  I considered that the breaches showed a comprehensive failure on the part of the father to comply with the detailed terms of the court order.  In addition, he had used the boys to communicate changes and arrangements, fixing them with the responsibility for letting mum know his plans for them or the arrangements, and the blame agenda against the mother continued unabated.”
The Father had already stated his intention to disregard any such order. The circumstances were exceptional in that the Father had already repeatedly demonstrated that the attachment of a penal notice alone was insufficient to secure compliance with court orders.
Analysis and Conclusion
At the conclusion of the hearing I announced my decision that I would grant permission to appeal on this ground on that basis that it had a real prospect of success. I made it clear to the Father that I had not yet determined the appeal itself and that he should not assume, as he had indicated he was doing, that he would inevitably succeed on the appeal itself.
The Judge had the power to make a non-molestation order. The fact that a penal notice was attached to the child arrangements order which prevented the Father from having face to face contact with his children did not preclude the making of a non-molestation order to the same effect. The latter order allowed for an arrest upon breach, the former did not. For the reasons articulated by the Judge at paragraph 82 of her judgment, there was some justification on the striking facts of this case for supporting the child arrangements order with a non-molestation order. The Father had repeatedly and unapologetically breached previous child arrangements orders and had evinced an intention not to be bound by any further orders with which he did not agree.
There had been no application for a non-molestation order and so there was no ex parte (without notice) application. This was an order made of the Court’s own motion under FLA 1996 s42(2)(b). As such FLA 1996 s45 does not apply – notice to the Father was not required by the rules or the Act.
The Court made the order of its own initiative, as it was entitled to do, but having done so without hearing from the Father, the requirements of FPR r4.3(4) and (5) applied. Whilst the Father had been made aware that consideration might well be given to making an order allowing for his arrest for breach of any order in relation to face to face contact with the children, and he had responded by saying that he would deliberately breach any such order, he had not been heard. He had not been forewarned of the possibility of his being excluded from a zone one mile from the children’s school or from their home, nor that he might be arrested if he instructed or encouraged anyone else to contact the children. Nor had he been warned that orders might be made extending to the Children’s 18th birthdays.
The exclusion zones of one mile from the boys’ school and one mile from their home were large and no consideration appears to have been given as to the practical impact of such a large exclusion area. The Father was in Australia but it was known that he was intending to return to England. As it is, I have not been told that the exclusion zones are, in themselves, causing him any particular difficulty, but he did not have any notice of the possibility of exclusion zones being imposed and he was not heard on that provision.
The order did state that “you have a right to apply to the court to change or cancel the order”, but there was no return date, the order was to last for over three years, and on the same date as it made the NMO, the Court ordered that “the father is prevented from “making any further application in relation to the children for the duration their minority without permission of the court.” I shall address that particular s91(14) order later in this judgment, but a litigant in person might believe that they were not entitled, without permission, to challenge the non-molestation order which related to the children.
By operation of CA 1989 ss91(10) and 9(6), the child arrangements order in relation to contact will cease to have effect when the Children are 16. The NMO was made to remain effective until the Children are 18. It has the effect therefore of continuing the order for no face to face contact for a further two years without the Court having found exceptional circumstances to justify the extension of the direct contact arrangements in the CAO beyond the Children’s 16th birthdays.
The obvious answer to the complaint that the Father was not heard on the non-molestation order is that he had chosen to absent himself from the hearing. He accepted to me during his oral submissions that because the particular Judge was continuing to hear the proceedings, he considered it futile to participate. Accordingly, it can be inferred that had the Father been informed by email or otherwise, that the Court was contemplating making an NMO to include exclusion zones and a prohibition on his using others to contact the children, he would not have engaged with the Court for so long as HHJ Atkinson was conducting the case.
There was no return date specified in the non-molestation order but there is no requirement in the FPR for a return date when the Court makes such an order of its own motion.  FPR r4.3 requires that the affected party is given an opportunity to be heard. The Father knew that a power of arrest was being considered, had indicated that he would deliberately breach any such order which carried with it a power of arrest, and had chosen not to participate in the hearing. I am satisfied that he was given an opportunity to be heard. FPR r4.3 also requires that an order made of the court’s own motion includes a statement of the right to have it set aside, varied or stayed. The order contained a statement that the Father could apply to change or cancel the order. The requirement was therefore met. It was stated to be a right and the s91(14) order was made in a separate order relating to the CAO. There is no evidence that the Father was confused by the orders – it is no part of his appeal that he believed that the s91(14) order applied to the NMO. The non-molestation order was made for a long period but its length was not in excess of the powers given to the Court by FLA 1996 s42.
The NMO was an exceptional order to make and I have carefully considered whether it was necessary but I am satisfied that the Judge was entitled of her own motion to make an NMO that the Father must not have in person contact with the Children and must not instruct or encourage anyone else to contact them on his behalf. The Father was given an opportunity to be heard and was told of his right to challenge the NMO once made. The Judge might have included a specific return date and might have made it clearer that the s91(14) order did not apply to the NMO, but no error of law was made in those respects. The Judge gave reasons why, given the exceptional non-compliance of the Father and the harm to the Children caused by his breaches and the need for the Mother to then seek enforcement, it was necessary to make an NMO alongside the CAO.
However, in one respect the NMO does not reflect the reasons given by the Judge for making it. The NMO prohibits the Father from encouraging or instructing any third party to contact the Children on his behalf but, unlike the CAO, it does not prohibit him from initiating contact (other than having contact in person). At paragraph 82 of her judgment (quoted above) when justifying the making of the NMO,  the Judge said, “The requirement in the order that he should not initiate contact with the children  … is essential in order to enforce this order, and it is essential to ensure that they are kept safe from harm.  On that basis, I am justified, in my judgment, in making a non-molestation order to support the contact order and to keep the children free from harm.” But the NMO did not support the CAO in that particular respect because it did not prevent the Father from initiating contact with the children. Naturally, the absence of an order within the NMO barring the Father himself from initiating indirect contact is not the subject of appeal. There is no cross-appeal by the Mother who is a litigant in person.
I have two remaining concerns about the NMO:
The exclusion zone order ought to have been expressed differently to be in accordance with paragraph 18 of the President’s Guidance from 2023. I have not been told that it has caused any practical difficulties for the Father going about his day to day business in England. Nevertheless, the Guidance ought to have been followed.
The NMO lasts two years longer than the CAO. This discrepancy was not addressed by the Judge in her judgment. The Judge did not find any exceptional reasons for extending the CAO for time with and contact with the Father beyond the Children’s 16th birthdays. The NMO was therefore more than a mechanism for backing up the child arrangements order: it had the effect of extending the prohibition on direct contact for two years beyond the CAO. Nor did the Judge address the duration of the NMO in her ex tempore judgment.
These points were not addressed by the parties at the appeal hearing. Only after I had taken time to consider my judgment on the appeal did they come to the forefront of my mind. I therefore informed all parties of my concerns about these matters and gave them opportunity to make further written submissions if they desired. They did so. The Mother rightly said that the points above had not been raised by the Appellant, but he is a litigant in person and, having noted these concerns, I must address them. Counsel for the Children submitted that the Judge was wrong to make a non-molestation order effectively barring face to face contact with the children to age 18. She submitted that the contact provisions of the CAO cease to have effect when the Children are 16 and therefore making an NMO to last until they were 18 was disproportionate.
The experienced Judge made clear in her judgments that the Father was one of the most unbending, angry and non-compliant litigants she had ever encountered. Her findings that he was causing significant harm to the Children were ones she was entitled to make. Her legitimate goal was to protect these Children and she considered that the making of an NMO to support the CAO was required. However, she did not give reasons for why the NMO would be made until the Children were 18. I cannot import to this part of her decision-making, the reasons she later gave for making a s91(14) order for the whole of the Children’s minority. Had she expressly addressed whether there were exceptional circumstances to extend the CAO in relation to time with the father to the Children’s 18th birthdays, then perhaps she may have made that order. But she did not do so. The orders made were not coterminous as perhaps the Judge had intended. Making the NMO  to remain in force until the Children were 18 was an exceptional course and required justification.
With misgivings because of the consequent prolongation of these proceedings, I have concluded that the appeal against the NMO should be allowed on the grounds that the Judge did not give reasons for making an NMO of a longer duration than the similarly (but not identically) worded CAO which she intended to use the NMO to “support”. The Judge did not give reasons for making an NMO until the Children were 18. The Judge did not expressly consider the duration of the NMO in the context of the CA 1989 provisions about extending CAO’s beyond a child’s 16th birthday. To make an NMO barring the Father from having direct contact with the Children until they were 18 ought to have been recognised by the Judge as an exceptional course, requiring specific justification. These were errors which mean that the appeal against the NMO should be allowed.
As for the exclusion zone provisions within the NMO, I do not consider them to be an error of law or an irregularity causing injustice such that the appeal should be allowed on that ground. However, given the orders I shall make, as set out below, the Judge will have an opportunity to reconsider the terms of any exclusion zone orders.
S. 91(14) Order
At the hearing I announced that I would give permission to appeal the s91(14) Order. The order was an exceptional one in that it would last for over three years and until the children were 18. I was giving permission to appeal the NMO which also lasted until the Children were 18 and it seemed to me that there was a compelling reason to consider the appeals against both grounds in order to analyse how the orders sat together and alongside the CAO. As noted above, I emphasised to the Father that the grant of permission was not an indication of success on the appeal itself.
The Legal Framework
CA1989 s91(14) provides:
“On disposing of any application for an order under this Act, the court may (whether or not it makes any other order in response to the application) order that no application for an order under this Act of any specified kind may be made with respect to the child concerned by any person named in the order without leave of the court.”
CA 1989 s91A provides:
This section makes further provision about orders under section 91(14) (referred to in this section as “section 91(14) orders”).
The circumstances in which the court may make a section 91(14) order include, among others, where the court is satisfied that the making of an application for an order under this Act of a specified kind by any person who is to be named in the section 91(14) order would put—
the child concerned, or
another individual (“the relevant individual”),
at risk of harm.
In the case of a child or other individual who has reached the age of eighteen, the reference in subsection (2) to “harm” is to be read as a reference to ill-treatment or the impairment of physical or mental health.
Where a person who is named in a section 91(14) order applies for leave to make an application of a specified kind, the court must, in determining whether to grant leave, consider whether there has been a material change of circumstances since the order was made.
A section 91(14) order may be made by the court—
on an application made—
by the relevant individual;
by or on behalf of the child concerned;
by any other person who is a party to the application being disposed of by the court;
of its own motion.
In this section, “the child concerned” means the child referred to in section 91(14).”
Hence, s91(14) orders may only be made in respect of applications for orders under the CA1989. They may be made of the Court’s own motion. They may be made in respect of applications in relation  to “the child concerned” whatever the age of the child (provided they are a child and therefore under 18) and there is no prohibition on a s91(14) order having effect until a child reaches the age of 18 as was ordered in the present case.  Nevertheless, in In the matter of S (Children) [2006] EWCA Civ 1190, the Court of Appeal held at [85] and [90]:
“[85] In our judgement, however, orders made without limit of time, and orders expressed to last until a child is 16 should be the exception rather than the rule, and where they are made, the reasons for making them should be fully and carefully set out.
[90] Section 91(14) of the Act has been described as both draconian and flexible. Both descriptions are apt. Its use, however, has to be carefully controlled by the court as part of its over-arching strategy, which is to preserve and foster relationships wherever possible. An order which is indeterminate, or which is expressed to last until the sixteenth birthday of the relevant child is, in effect, an acknowledgement by the court that nothing more can be done. As we have already made clear, cases in which the court reaches the end of the road do exist, and there are cases in which it is essential for the welfare of the children and the physical health and sanity of the resident parent that an indefinite halt is called to litigation. But if the court has indeed reached that stage, it needs to spell out its reasons clearly, so that the parents – and in particularly the parent who is the subject of the s 91(14) order knows precisely where he or she stands, and precisely what issues he or she had to address if an application for permission to apply is going to be possible.”
As is clear from that judgment, such orders are permissible but they give the appearance that the Court is “permanently shutting the door of the court in the litigant’s face” and so should be rare.
Analysis and Conclusions
No notice was given to the Father that the Court would consider extending or otherwise varying the s91(14) order initially made on 9 December 2022. That original order had prevented the Father from making “any further application in relation to the children save only in respect of any application seeking permission to remove them from the jurisdiction for the purpose of a holiday. The order was to remain in force until the children concluded their GCSEs (when each would be nearly 16). On 25 April 2024 the Judge ordered,
“S91(14) Children Act 1989 Order
The father is prevented from making any further application in relation to the children for the duration of their minority without permission of the court. Any application for leave to apply shall be reserved to HHJ Atkinson.”
I am satisfied that, as a s91(14) order, it only applied to applications under the CA 1989 in respect of the two children. However, it was wider than the previous s91(14) order because it covered all applications under the Act in respect of the Children, and was to be remain effective until they reached the age of 18.
As noted, the contact arrangements within the child arrangements order made on 25 April 2024 will cease to have effect when the Children reach the age of 16. The “lives with” order will continue to have effect beyond that age. Without the s91(14) order the Father would also be entitled to bring applications for prohibited steps or specific issue orders. Hence, it was not illogical to make a s91(14) order that persists beyond the Children’s 16th birthdays. Nevertheless, as the Court of Appeal made clear in In the matter of S (Children) (above) orders of that kind should be the exception rather than the rule and the reasons for making them should be fully and carefully set out.
The Judge explained her reasons for extending the s91(14) order as follows:
Section 91(14): my original section 91(14) order was to extend until the children had finished their GCSEs, I think, anticipating that the father might have made a further application in relation to their schooling at that point.  In fact, these children have not had a moment of the peace. So, I am going to extend the 91(14) order.  I am removing the limited permission to apply in relation to a holiday.  I am extending the 91(14) order during their minority. These children need peace.  The father, although he is not ostensibly engaging in these proceedings, he is perpetuating them, in my judgment. He is weaponizing them in order to undermine the mother’s parenting of the boys, and using the opportunity to visit more turmoil on them in so doing.  I anticipate that this decision will bring more challenges and further applications to vary – perhaps with the return of the father to the UK, or simply because he decides not to return and seeks orders which reflect that.”
The Judge did not recognise that she had not extended the contact arrangements in the CAO beyond the Children’s 16th birthdays but she was entitled in law to make a s91(14) order that had effect during the whole of their minority and she gave reasons for taking that exceptional course.
The Father’s skeleton argument contends that the use of the term “minority” within the s91(14) Order was insufficiently clear, but a “child” is defined at CA 1989 s105 as a person under the age of 18 (save for an exception which is of no present relevance). In context “minority” meant the period until the Children reached the age of 18.
The Father’s skeleton also contends that it was not made sufficiently clear to the Father what he needed to do in order to be given permission to make an application. I reject that submission – the Father’s unacceptable conduct had been the subject of a number of judgments and the Judge’s condemnation of his harmful behaviour could not have been made more clear. Likewise, the need to protect the Children from the Father “weaponizing” litigation to “visit more turmoil” on them was spelled out by the Judge. Hence, any future application by the Father during the Children’s minorities would have to be devoid of those characteristics for the Court to be able to consider giving permission. The Court cannot spell out in advance precisely what would be required for permission to be given but the Judge has made clear where the Father stands and what he has to change in order for the grant of permission to be possible. Sadly, the Father shows no signs of accepting the Judge’s findings and analysis, but the Judge has made it clear that so long as the Father continues his use of proceedings to undermine the mother and bring turmoil on the Children, future permission to bring applications under the Act is unlikely to be granted.
The Father’s conduct was regarded by the Judge as being exceptional and she was entitled to conclude that it called for an exceptional order. The Judge made no error of law; there was no injustice caused by procedural error, the judge was entitled to make the order that she made and she gave her reasons for doing so. I dismiss the appeal against the s91(14) order.
Final Conclusions and Disposal
For the reasons given I refuse permission to appeal the Judge’s decision not to recuse herself, and against the making of the CAO. I grant permission to appeal the s91(14) order but dismiss the appeal against that order. I grant the appeal against the NMO.
As noted, the Children are now separately represented and they have expressed views about the NMO through Counsel in this appeal. The question of whether those views are independent of paternal influence is another matter. A further change since the Judge made the NMO in April 2024 is that the Father has returned to England to live. It is of course possible that he will not remain but he is now living here.
I have considered the Court’s powers on appeal. In the present case the Judge was not wrong to make an NMO but the duration and terms of the NMO were not consistent with the CAO it was intended to support, and no reasons were given for the duration of the NMO which was in any event inconsistent with the duration of the CAO. Furthermore, considerable time has passed since the NMO was made and the Children are now separately represented. If the NMO is to be reconsidered then it should be reconsidered in its entirety. In my judgement the appropriate order is to set aside the NMO but to remit the case to HHJ Atkinson for reconsideration of the making and terms of the NMO. I have refused permission against the recusal decision. It is appropriate for the same Judge to reconsider the making and terms of the NMO. At the same time, in order to allow the Judge fully to consider the duration and consistency of the orders, I shall refer the issue of the duration of the CAO to HHJ Atkinson.
I must advise the Appellant Father that this appeal decision does not mean that all the Judge’s previous orders are open for reconsideration. The appeal against the s91(14) order has been dismissed. Permission to appeal the CAO has been refused. Given the history of this case it is important that there is clarity as to what the Judge must reconsider in the light of my decision. I shall direct that the NMO be set aside and that the case be remitted to HHJ Atkinson for her to give directions, on paper, for a with notice hearing to reconsider the following matters:
The making of an NMO against the Father.
The terms of the NMO and in particular:
The wording of any exclusion zone orders;
The wording of any orders concerning the Father initiating contact with the Children by himself of by encouraging or instructing others.
The duration of the NMO, any extension of the contact provisions of the CAO beyond the Children’s 16th birthdays, and the consistency of the duration of the CAO and any NMO that the Court may make.

MR JUSTICE SHELDON
Mr Justice Sheldon :
Dare International Ltd (“Dare”) seeks damages and injunctive relief against two former employees, Stephen Soliman (D1) and Ashely Hikmet (D2) (D1 and D2 will be referred to collectively as “the Defendants”). D1 and D2 worked for Dare as Senior Traders. They have accepted offers of employment with Dare’s principal rival, Onyx Capital Management Limited (“Onyx”) to work in their nascent Dubai office. (Footnote: 1) Dare invites the Court to (i) enforce post-termination restraints by way of final injunction; (2) grant springboard relief to cancel the unlawful advantage gained by the Defendants’ alleged wrongdoing whilst employed by Dare; and (3) make findings on liability with respect to alleged breaches of contract and fiduciary duty. Quantum (if any) will be addressed at a further hearing. Dare also alleges that the Defendants were unjustly enriched on the basis that they were paid their base salary under a mistake of fact: that the Defendants were too sick to work.
On 18 July 2024, Anthony Metzer KC, sitting as a deputy judge of the High Court, accepted undertakings from the Defendants that they would comply with the terms of the post-termination restraints contained in their contracts of employment, and ordered a speedy trial. Prior to the trial, there were a number of applications to determine case management matters.
The trial of the claim took place over 13 days, starting on 5 November 2024. At trial, I was asked to hear evidence in private with respect to (i) Dare’s alleged confidential information; and (ii) D1’s medical condition. I agreed to these requests on the basis that, in my judgment, with respect to (i) there was a strong prima facie case that the material which would be discussed was confidential to Dare and would cause damage if it was publicly aired. With respect to (ii), it was clear to me that the medical information went to the heart of D1’s right to private life under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights. In respect of both sets of information, I considered that a fair trial could only be ensured by holding parts of the hearing in private, and this outweighed the open justice principle on the very specific facts of this case.
At trial, I also made a number of restricted reporting orders, prohibiting the publication of very specific information that had inadvertently been mentioned in the public hearing regarding aspects of Dare’s alleged confidential information and D1’s confidential medical information.
During the trial, I heard evidence from Ayman Rahman, Dare’s Chief Executive Officer and one of its founders, and Jonathan Ooi, Dare’s Chief Investment Officer and Head of Trading and another one of Dare’s founders. The Defendants gave evidence on behalf of themselves. The Court also heard evidence from four medical experts.
I did not hear evidence from Thomas Law, another former Senior Trader who had resigned from Dare at around the same time as D1. Dare also issued legal proceedings against Mr Law, and a speedy trial was ordered to commence on 20 January 2025 (Footnote: 2). I heard some evidence about Mr Law, and will be required to make some findings about his conversation with D2 on 8 May 2024 at the Oka restaurant, and whether or not D2 sought to solicit Mr Law to work for Onyx.
As I will explain, I have found that some of the information that Dare has sought to protect as confidential is rightly to be treated as confidential. So as to safeguard the confidentiality of that information, I shall refer to it generically in this judgment (and remove specific references from quoted documents) and will provide more detail in a short confidential annexe. I will also produce a confidential annexe which sets out more details of D1’s medical condition and the evidence that was presented to the Court about it.
Approach to evidence
The Court was provided with voluminous written evidence. The Court also heard from each of the key actors over a period of days. I consider that each of the witnesses tried to be helpful to the Court and gave truthful and reliable evidence on most of the matters about which they were asked. For each of them, however, there were aspects of their evidence which was not reliable. As a result, contrary to the submissions of the parties, I do not automatically prefer the evidence of Dare’s witnesses or that of either of the Defendants whenever there is a dispute between them with respect to a particular event or matter.
To give a flavour of some of the difficulties the Court had with the truthfulness or reliability of each of the witnesses, I will set out some examples. There were occasions when their oral evidence flew in the face of contemporaneous materials written by them or by third parties. For instance, Mr Ooi was asked questions about the mental health of traders at Dare, and in particular the email from Tris Murley (Dare’s Performance Manager) dated 3 December 2023 which described Mr Murley’s concerns about traders’ mental health. Mr Ooi said in evidence that what was being described related only to the period following D1’s resignation. That was plainly wrong. Whilst it may be the case that matters got worse after D1’s resignation, the email from Mr Murley was clearly referring also to the period before D1’s resignation. Similarly, Mr Rahman’s evidence about whether or not he had used the term “partnership” with the Defendants when discussing a new arrangement for them in early 2021 was not reliable, as it was directly contradicted by a document that was disclosed by Dare, and produced to the Court, on day 9 of the trial (discussed further at paragraphs 35-39 below).
There were occasions when seemingly important evidence was provided to the Court which ought to have been included in their extensive and carefully crafted witness statements raising doubts as to its reliability. There were occasions when witnesses did not recall certain events or conversations. I found that this was defensive and was intended to conceal potentially harmful evidence from the Court, rather than a genuine expression of a failure in memory. Whilst I do not doubt that witnesses could not recall the detail of every conversation or meeting, there seemed to be an element of selectivity: remembering information that was thought to be helpful to one’s case. This was especially the case with D1 who repeatedly said that he could not recall the content of conversations that he had with John Beckwith, the Chief People Officer of Onyx, but could remember details of other matters that occurred around the same time.
D2 belatedly acknowledged that he had deliberately deleted certain evidence -- emails from Mr Beckwith -- which had been drafted for D2 to send on to Dare in response to various requests or communications. D2 admitted that he had been requested to delete these emails by Mr Beckwith. This was presumably done so as to conceal Mr Beckwith’s involvement in that correspondence if litigation did transpire. D2 also allowed his solicitors to give a false impression as to what happened to those emails when asked specifically about them in pre-trial correspondence with Dare’s solicitors: Allen & Overy LLP (now A&O Shearman). The fact that D2 had done this meant that the Court was alive to the possibility that other relevant correspondence may have been deleted, and that other aspects of the evidence may not be totally reliable.
D2 had also allowed his solicitors to give a false impression to Dare’s solicitors in their response to the letter before claim sent on 11 June 2024. In that letter, Fox Williams, the solicitors for D2, wrote that “Since his resignation, our client has not spoken to either Mr Soliman or Mr Law (nor any other employee of Dare) about his resignation from Dare or his plans for future employment”. This was plainly untrue, as D2 had had the conversation with Mr Law at the Oka restaurant on 8 May 2024. In cross-examination, D2 said that he had not seen the reference to Mr Law in the letter when it was shown to him by his solicitors, but only the reference to D1. This was not a credible response: the letter did not just refer to D1 and Mr Law, it referred also to “any other employee of Dare”.
Both Defendants have suggested that they did not always set out their true feelings and thoughts in some of the pre-resignation correspondence with, in particular, Mr Rahman. They both stated that they hid their disappointment with, and on occasion opposition to, Mr Rahman’s statements or activities so as not to upset him. I accept that this may have happened on occasion, but it was not always the case. Mr Rahman accepted in cross-examination that when discussing the Dubai venture (discussed at paragraphs 31-34 below), D1 told him that he no longer trusted him, and he accused Mr Rahman to his face of lying.
The Defendants sought to convey to the Court that they were scared of Mr Rahman. I do not find that this was how they viewed Mr Rahman during the period before their resignations from Dare. Overall, the evidence demonstrated that the Defendants had a good relationship with Mr Rahman. The numerous exchanges between them that were seen by the Court were friendly. I accept that Mr Rahman did raise his voice on the trading floor, and had the reputation of being something of a “warrior” when trading, but he was not alone in shouting on the trading floor. There was evidence that the trading floor was a loud place. The shouting was generally directed at junior employees, and the evidence was that D1 participated in this. There was evidence that on one occasion Mr Rahman had shouted at and belittled D1, but this was an isolated incident. There was also an occasion, on 26 September 2023, when Mr Rahman had spoken negatively to the Senior Trader group about their performance (see paragraph 177 below).
After they handed in their resignations, however, I find that both Defendants believed that Mr Rahman would be somewhat vengeful towards them during and after their notice period. That was reflected in the exchanges that D2 had with Mr Beckwith and later with Mr Law, discussed further below. Their concern about what Mr Rahman might do infected some of their responses and reactions in the post-resignation period.
The Court was shown a website called “Glass Door” which included anonymous reviews of the merits of working at Dare. The postings that I saw did not reflect well on Dare, as Mr Rahman accepted when this was put to him. One review posted on 17 May 2024 (after the departure of a number of staff) stated that:
“Extremely toxic and cult like environment (known to be by far the worst in the industry). Not only do people overtly shout for no reason at juniors, it is actually encouraged. People have had to “make juniors cry"" to get promoted. The better you fit into this toxic environment the more you get rewarded . . .”
On the other hand, a review posted on 24 January 2024 stated that:
“I get the impression that if you are a trader, it's a really great place to work”.
I do not regard these materials as being of any real help in determining what the environment was for the Defendants themselves. It is clear that the reviews were written by, or in respect of, junior traders and did not reflect the reality of the working life and experiences of Senior Traders.
A great deal of the evidence that was shown to the Court involved messages between various key actors in the events that the Court was required to consider: both WhatsApp messages and messages on the Microsoft Teams platform. For the period up until the time of the Defendants’ resignations, I regard these messages as, by and large, reflecting and representing the reality of the situation involving the various actors and their genuine motivations and intentions. These messages were sent as part of the free-flow of communications between the senders and recipients, without thought of litigation and that they would be subject to the forensic scrutiny of a trial. They were also not written by, or with the assistance of, lawyers or others who had an interest in a particular narrative being developed. That situation changed following the resignations, when the spectre of litigation loomed large in the minds of the key participants, and so I treat the content of some of that later correspondence with more suspicion.
Factual Background
It is not possible to set out all of the evidence that was presented to the Court, and it would not be proportionate to do so. Rather, I intend to set out the key background facts and then focus on some of the areas which are of direct relevance to the main issues of dispute between the parties and have a bearing on the relief that Dare seeks. The fact that other material is not referred to does not mean that it was not properly considered in producing this judgment.
The key background facts are as follows. Dare is a proprietary trading business operating in the global energy markets. It trades securities on its own behalf and uses its own money to make profits. The securities that it trades are derivatives of energy commodities. Dare is based in London. The Defendants were Senior Traders at Dare: D1 was Head of the Propane and Naphtha desk, and D2 was Head of the Crude Oil desk.
D1 commenced employment for Dare on 11 February 2019. He had previously been a bond trader with Santander Corporate and Investment Banking. Following the end of his employment at Santander and before starting work with Dare, D1 travelled the world extensively and enjoyed what he described as “a year abroad”. D2 commenced employment for Dare on 19 February 2018. He had previously been an energy trader with EDF.
Fresh contracts of employment
On 1 January 2021, the Defendants entered into fresh employment contracts with a previous corporate incarnation of Dare – Vercer Limited. The new contracts of employment required the Defendants to give 12 months’ notice of termination, and subjected them to post-termination restraints for 12 months, with (as I shall subsequently discuss) the possibility of the restraint period being reduced according to the terms of a “Garden Leave” clause.
The contracts contained express obligations on the Defendants:
“to disclose to the Company full details of his own wrongdoing and any wrongdoing by any employee of any Vercer Group Company where that wrongdoing is material to that employee’s employment by the relevant company or to the interests or reputation of the Company and/or any Vercer Group Company”.
See clause 3(c)(6).
“to keep the Company (and, where appropriate the board of directors and/or members of any other Vercer Group Company) fully informed of his conduct and of the business, finances, or affairs of the Company or any other Vercer Group Company in a prompt and timely manner”.
See clause 3(c)(7).
Clause 10 of the contract imposed obligations if the Defendants were absent from work as a result of sickness:
If at any time Employee is unable to attend work by reason of sickness, ill health, or injury, he is required to contact his Manager by 10:00am on the first day of absence. Employee should explain the reason for absence, give an estimate of his expected return date, and indicate any outstanding matters that require attention while he is not at work.
On Employee's return to work, he must confirm the dates and reason for absence in writing by completing a self-certification form. For absences of seven or more consecutive days (including weekends), Employee is required to provide a doctor's medical certificate and to carry on providing certificates to cover the whole period of sickness, ill health, or injury absence. Failure to document adequately an illness, injury, or accident when requested to do so may be grounds for disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment.
. . .
If Employee is absent from work due to sickness or injury, or at any other time at the reasonable request of the Company, the Company may require Employee to undergo a medical examination by a medical practitioner appointed by the Company at any time. By signing this Agreement, Employee consents to being examined by a doctor or specialist selected by the Company and Employee authorizes that medical practitioner to disclose to the Company any report or test results prepared or obtained as a result of that examination and to discuss with it any matters arising out of the examination which are relevant to Employee's employment”.
The post-termination restraints were as follows:
CONFIDENTIALITY AND NON-DISCLOSURE
Employee acknowledges that by virtue of this Agreement and Employee's employment with the Company, Employee has been or will be exposed to or has had or will have access to confidential and proprietary information regarding Vercer and the Vercer's Group's business, all of which are proprietary to Vercer and the Vercer Group. This information includes various trade secrets and other highly confidential information of Vercer and the Vercer Group that is not in the public domain, including, without limitation, (1) marketing and business development methods and plans, (2) any financial information relating to Vercer and/or the Vercer Group, (3) Vercer and/or the Vercer Group investor and other client lists, (4) information relating to existing and prospective brokers, market makers and other intermediary and trading counterparties, (5) confidential information received from prospective brokers, market makers and other intermediary and trading counterparties, (6) software, databases, financial models, trading tools, formulae, methodologies, and related technology used by Vercer and/or the Vercer Group in their business, (7) compensation and employment information regarding Vercer and/or Vercer Group employees or contractors, (8) targeted revenue opportunities, (9) information related to access to key brokers, market makers and counterparties, (10) information relating to or constituting source code for front end systems, information relating to technical connections to exchanges at which Vercer and/or the Vercer Group conducts business or is seeking to do business, structures of Vercer and/or the Vercer Group's internal network connections between servers and computers, and database management techniques and protocols, and (11) the historical performance return of any fund or entity of Vercer or the Vercer Group, whether held in hardcopy, electronic or other form (all of the above are collectively referred to herein as ""Field Materials"").
. . .
POST-TERMINATION COVENANTS
Employee acknowledges that by virtue of this Agreement and Employee's employment with the Company, Employee has or will become familiar with Vercer's and the Vercer Group's Field Materials, all of which are highly confidential and proprietary to Vercer and the Vercer Group. Employee further acknowledges that Vercer and the Vercer Group have expended substantial time and resources in the development of their Field Materials, that Vercer and the Vercer Group have a protectable business interest in their Field Materials, that Vercer and the Vercer Group have taken reasonable and appropriate precautions to protect the confidentiality of the Field Materials, and that if the Field Materials were to be obtained by a competitor of Vercer or the Vercer Group, it would materially and irreparably diminish Vercer's and the Vercer Group's competitive advantage. Additionally, Employee acknowledges that Vercer and the Vercer Group have expended substantial time and resources in the development and maintenance of relationships with brokers, market makers and other intermediary and trading counterparties and other client relationships, and in the recruitment, development, and training of their employees, consultants and contractors and Employee will acquire personal knowledge of and influence over such brokers, market makers and other intermediary and trading counterparties and the employees and contractors of, the Company and Vercer Group.
In this paragraph 13, the following expressions have the meanings set out below:
""Prospective Restricted Contact"" means any person who is acting or might act in the capacity of a broker, market maker or other intermediary or trading counterparty to Vercer or any Vercer Group Company to whom Vercer or any Vercer Group Company has offered to supply services or has provided details of the terms on which it would or might be willing to supply services or has had any negotiations or discussions regarding the possible supply of services;
""Relevant Period"" means the period of 12 months prior to the Termination Date; and
""Restrictions Payment"" means a sum accruing during the Restrictions Payment Period at the annual rate equal to the yearly base salary payable under clause 5 as at the Termination Date;
""Restrictions Payment Period"" means the period between the Termination Date and the expiration of the restrictions in paragraph 13(c), having regard, in particular, to the effect of paragraph 13(d);
""Restricted Contacts"" means any person acting in the capacity of a broker, market maker or other intermediary or trading counterparty to Vercer or any Vercer Group Company;
""Termination Date"" means the date Employee's employment terminates for any reason whatsoever.
In recognition of Vercer's and the Vercer Group's efforts to protect their legitimate business interests in the Field Materials, relationships with Restricted Contacts, Prospective Restricted Clients and valued employee and consultant relationships and in recognition of the Restrictions Payment, Employee covenants and agrees that he will not, directly or indirectly, for his own account or for any other person, whether as a director, employee, agent, consultant, or otherwise, during the course of Employee's employment with the Company and:
for the period of twelve (12) months following the Termination Date, establish, carry on, be engaged, concerned, interested in, or employed by any business which is in competition or about to be in competition with the business of Vercer or the Vercer Group (other than the passive holding of not more than 5% of the issued shares of a company which is listed on a recognized stock exchange), and with which Employee was materially involved at any time during the Relevant Period or in relation to which he had access to Field Material;
for the period of twelve (12) months from the Termination Date canvass or solicit (or attempt to canvass or solicit) in competition with the business of Vercer and/or any Vercer Group Company with which Employee was materially involved at any time during the Relevant Period the investment business of (or introduced by) any person who was at any time during the Relevant Period, a Restricted Contact and with whom during the Relevant Period Employee had material dealings and/or in relation to whom he had access to Field Materials;
for the period of twelve (12) months from the Termination Date canvass or solicit (or attempt to canvass or solicit) in competition with the business of Vercer and/or any Vercer Group Company with which Employee was materially involved at any time during the Relevant Period the investment business of (or which might be introduced by) any person who was at any time during the Relevant Period, a Prospective Restricted Contact and with whom during the Relevant Period Employee had material dealings and/or in relation to whom he had access to Field Materials;
for the period of twelve (12) months from the Termination Date in competition with the business of Vercer and/or any Vercer Group Company with which Employee was materially involved at any time during the Relevant Period deal with any person who was at any time during the Relevant Period, a Restricted Contact and with whom during the Relevant Period Employee had material dealings and/or in relation to whom he had access to Field Materials;
for the period of twelve (12) months from the Termination Date in competition with the business of Vercer and/or any Vercer Group Company with which Employee was materially involved at any time during the Relevant Period deal with any person who was at any time during the Relevant Period, a Prospective Restricted Client and with whom during the Relevant Period Employee had material dealings and/or in relation to whom he had access to Field Materials; and/or
for the period of twelve (12) months from the Termination Date employ, engage or entice away from (or attempt or assist to employ, engage or entice away from) Vercer and/or any Vercer Group Company any person who was during the Relevant Period, an employee, director, officer, agent, partner, contractor, or consultant of Vercer and or any Vercer Group Company, whom Employee managed, with whom he had material dealings or worked closely at any time during the Relevant Period and/or who is in possession of Field Materials and is likely to be able to assist or benefit a business in, or proposing to be in, competition with Vercer and/or any Vercer Group Company.
The periods for which the restrictions in paragraphs 13(c) apply shall be reduced by any time Employee spends on Garden Leave immediately prior to the termination of his employment.
Employee acknowledges and agrees that the Company and the Vercer Group's business is global in nature, that the Restricted Contacts and Prospective Restricted Contacts served or who might be served by the Company and the Vercer Group are not dependent on the geographic location of personnel or the businesses by which they are employed, and that the Field Materials could be wrongfully disclosed and/or used to the irreparable detriment of the Company and the Vercer Group's business from any geographic location in the world with electronic access to exchanges that make markets in in any product, security, commodity, derivative, or contract during the eighteen (18) months preceding the date of determination.
Employee acknowledges that he has received sufficient consideration for the restrictions set forth in this paragraph 13 by virtue of entering into an employment relationship with the Company on the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement (including and in particular the consideration offered in the Restrictions Payment and the period of notice to which he is entitled under paragraph 6(a) and he agrees that each of the restrictions in paragraph 13(c) is reasonable (including  having regard to the ability of Employee to earn a living) and extends no further than is necessary for the protection of the legitimate business interests of Vercer and the Vercer Group.
Each of the restrictions contained in paragraph 13(c) constitutes an entirely separate and independent covenant. If any covenant is found to be invalid this will not affect the validity or enforceability of any of the other covenants.
If Employee applies for or is otherwise offered employment or an engagement, appointment, or consultancy at any time during his employment, Employee will immediately inform the Company of such offer of employment or engagement and Employee will provide a copy of this paragraph 13 to the person or entity that he has applied to or has made such offer.
. . .
Provided that and for so long as Employee complies with the terms of paragraph 13, the Company will pay to Employee the Restrictions Payment in respect of the Restrictions Payment Period . . .”
The “Garden Leave” provision was as follows (clause 7):
Following service of notice to terminate Employees employment by any party, or if Employee purports to terminate his employment in breach of contract, the Company may at its discretion require Employee not to perform any services (or to perform only specified services) for the Company until a specified date or the termination of Employee s employment (“Garden Leave”).
During any period of Garden Leave, the Company shall be under no obligation to provide any work to, or vest any powers in, Employee who shall have no right to perform any services for the Company. The Company may assign Employee other duties and may appoint another person to carry out Employee s duties in substitution for him. Employee shall continue to receive his basic salary and all contractual benefits in the usual way, shall remain an employee of the Company and be bound by the terms of this Agreement, particularly in relation to any duties of confidentiality and fidelity. Employee must not be employed by or provide services to any third party during any period of Garden Leave.
During any period of Garden Leave, Employee shall not, without the prior written consent of his manager, attend his place of work or any other premises of the Company; nor, without the prior written consent of his manager, contact or deal with (or attempt to contact or deal with) any officer, employee, consultant, broker, market maker, other intermediary or trading counterparty, supplier, agent, distributor, shareholder, adviser, or other business contact of the Company or the Vercer Group; shall provide such assistance as required to effect an orderly handover or his duties and responsibilities to the best of his ability; and (except during any periods taken as holiday in the usual way) ensure that his manager knows where he will be and how he can be contacted during each working day, shall make himself available to deal with requests for information, and shall comply with any written requests to contact a specified employee, officer or consultant of the Company at specified intervals.
Employee acknowledges and agrees that the exercise by the Company of any of its rights under this clause 7 is fair, reasonable and necessary to protect the legitimate business interests of the Company and Employee anticipates, without prejudice to the other terms of this Agreement, that the Company is likely to exercise such rights”.
The fresh contracts of employment were not foisted on the Defendants. The Defendants were provided with time to consider them in draft. Among other things, D1 asked further questions about the post-termination restraints and the interaction with the notice period. In an email exchange on 8 February 2021, D1 asked whether Dare could confirm that “if I were to leave the firm, I can definitely work somewhere else from 12 months after my notice is handed in? It's not totally clear if it's 12 months after the notice is given, or if it's 12 months after you stop working (ie. If one is made to work their notice period)”.” Mr Rahman’s response was “Our intention would be to keep leavers out for only 12 months”. This response was somewhat ambiguous, but D1 has not pleaded that there was any misrepresentation made by Dare when the contract of employment was signed. As I will explain, on its face the contract of employment allows Dare to require staff to work out their notice and then stay out of the market for a further 12 months, assuming that the post-termination restraints are enforceable.
The Defendants’ roles at Dare
The Defendants headed their respective trading desks and set the gameplan for the trades carried out on those desks. They were successful traders and were very well remunerated for their efforts. They were an important part of Dare’s business, being personally responsible for a significant portion of Dare’s revenue.
At the date of D1’s resignation, there were two other significant traders on the Propane and Naphtha desk: Georgi Belinchev who was D1’s ‘number two’, and Rowan Nijjar, who was in charge of trading the Naphtha book. There were also two Associate Traders and two other employees working on the desk. D1 made the majority of the trading decisions on Propane. D1 had no decision-making authority with respect to hiring and firing staff who worked on the desk. D1 did not know the specific bonuses or salaries of those working on the desk. He occasionally carried out appraisals and managed performance of traders working on his desk, and had some participation in interviewing candidates for roles at Dare. D1 had no involvement in the formal or structured training of staff, but acknowledged in evidence that staff who spent time on the desk would learn from him and I have no doubt that he sought to provide them with on-the-job type training.
In the period before his resignation, D1 was in discussion with Mr Rahman about trading a different product. D1 attended a dinner hosted by the exchange for that product and was introduced as the future of Dare in that product.
D2 worked with four junior traders on the Crude Oil desk. They would rotate individually onto the desk, and he provided them with day-to-day on the job training. This was evidenced by a WhatsApp message sent by D2 to Mr Beckwith of Onyx on 15 February 2024 (two days after D2’s resignation) in which he referred to his having “trained to senior associate or associate level employees on my desk Amir and Erman”. D2 was not involved, however, in hiring or firing decisions on these junior traders, and did not know their individual remuneration packages.
The possibility of Dare opening an office in Dubai
In 2023, a number of Senior Traders proposed to Mr Rahman that Dare should open an office in Dubai. Dare spent time and money in exploring the logistics of the move and drafting relevant contracts of employment. The Defendants were both interested in the proposal, with D2 being especially keen. D2 and his wife even took a number of concrete steps towards relocating to Dubai in anticipation of the move: they turned down school places in London for their daughter and D2’s wife resigned from her job as an in-house lawyer.
Ultimately, the Senior Traders did not agree to sign up to the fresh contractual arrangements which they regarded as unfair and disadvantageous to them as compared to their arrangements in the London office. From Dare’s perspective, the proposed arrangements for Dubai were necessary to provide similar protections to what they could achieve via the non-competition restraints in senior traders’ contracts. I am told that the Courts in Dubai are less willing to enforce non-competition covenants than domestic courts.
The Defendants blamed Mr Rahman for what had taken place. D1 said that Mr Rahman had actively encouraged him to go to Dubai, and that Mr Rahman had lied about the contractual arrangements that would be put in place.  D2 said that Mr Rahman had changed his mind about the move to Dubai, having originally been supportive of it. Mr Rahman said in evidence that whilst he had been content for the Senior Traders to move to Dubai, he did not want the venture to introduce unnecessary risk to the business.
It is not necessary to make findings about what actually happened. What is relevant to this case is that both Defendants were clearly disappointed that the move to Dubai had not taken place, they blamed Mr Rahman for it, and it did lead to a loss of trust in Mr Rahman. It also made both Defendants feel less wedded to Dare, so that when a generous offer from Onyx to work in Dubai was dangled before them, they seized it.
Growth Share Plan
A further cause of disappointment for D1 was the Growth Share Plan that Dare presented to him in August 2023. D1 told the Court that he had been promised by Mr Rahman that he would be made a partner and would get a significant equity stake in the business. The Growth Share Plan that was produced by Dare did not meet D1’s expectations and, after taking legal advice, he did not sign up to it.
In his witness statement, Mr Rahman had said that
“Starting in around 2020/2021, I wanted to develop a scheme that would reward and incentivise the most senior employees of Dare, and encourage them to stay with us for the long term. I began to discuss with senior staff the idea of introducing a management incentive plan. At this stage, it was just an idea, and entirely separate from the employment contracts which were being varied around that time”.
He had also said that
“We had not promised anyone anything. I was not required to introduce the scheme at all”.
In cross-examination by Mr Adam Solomon KC, Mr Rahman denied that he had promised any form of partnership to D1, and that they had only discussed equity allocation.
Q.  We have talked about the new contract in 2021, the one that is extant now. The reason he entered that is because he was promised by you that he would be made a partner in Dare, isn't it?  That is the basis?
A.  No.
Q.  The Soliman agreement in 2021 doubled the length of the non-compete, didn't it?
A.  Correct.
Q.  He understood that he would get a significant equity stake at some point in Dare, didn't he, and you knew that's what he understood?
A.  No, I did not.
Q.  He had consistently talked about being made a partner?
A. I don't agree.
Q.  You don't agree that he had?
A.  I don't agree that he had consistently spoken about being a partner, no.
Q.  He had mentioned being a partner from time to time and you were aware of that?
A.  Partnership was never a point of discussion.
Mr Rahman was asked “The reason that he said partner was because that's the way it was referred to by him, isn't it?” to which Mr Rahman answered: “That is the way Stephen referred to it, yes”.
The cross-examination continued:
“Q.  And you know he referred to it as the partnership?
A.  If he referred to it to me, then I will be telling him it's not a partnership, it's an equity allocation or growth shares.
Q.  All right, I'll ask Mr Ooi why he didn't say that.  But I am suggesting you didn't ever say that to him and he was led to believe it was partnership?
A.  I don't agree”.
The implication of Mr Rahman’s evidence was that the term “partnership” was something that may have been used by D1, but was not something that he had referred to. This evidence was contradicted, however, by a document disclosed on day 9 of the trial, after Mr Rahman had given evidence. That document made clear that Mr Rahman had himself referred to the proposed arrangement as a “partnership”. The disclosure was of a WhatsApp message from Mr Rahman to senior traders dated 14 January 2021, in which he stated:
“you'll shortly be receiving an email from Steve Burden with your amended contracts as discussed in our catch up last year. Shouldn't be anything contentious or surprising, the only changes being the notice period and the option to draw from the bonus. Any questions let me know. Once this is done, we can move forward to structuring the partnership deals”.
(emphasis added).
The WhatsApp message disclosed on day 9 does not substantiate the allegation that a “promise” was made that if D1 signed the new contract of employment he would be made a partner. Nevertheless, it does demonstrate a close relationship between the two matters and certainly explains why D1 felt let down by Mr Rahman when he saw what was ultimately offered to him in the summer of 2023, making him less wedded to Dare and more amenable to Onyx’s generous offer. D2 was not positive about the Growth Share Plan, but did sign up to it in October 2023.
The Defendants’ resignations
I shall set out in some detail the circumstances surrounding and subsequent to the Defendants’ resignations as these are key to the various issues that the Court needs to resolve.
D1’s resignation
On 20 November 2023, D1 resigned, giving one year’s notice as he was required to do under the contract of employment. Prior to his resignation, D1 had been offered a position with Onyx and had negotiated a contract of employment and indemnity agreement.
D1 had been in discussion about working for Onyx since 19 September 2023. On that date, D1 was in Singapore attending a conference on behalf of Dare’s Direct Sales team. When he was there, D1 had a conversation with a head-hunter: Ms Sandhu. Between that date and 20 November 2023, D1 discussed the possibility of joining Onyx with Omar Kayaam (Co-Founder of Onyx), Mr Beckwith (Chief People Officer), Luke McDermott (a senior trader) and Greg Newman (another Co-Founder and Onyx’s Chief Executive Officer). Onyx competes with Dare, and its founders had previously worked with Mr Rahman earlier on in their careers.  There was a degree of rivalry between the two businesses.
In cross-examination, D1 stated that he had made it very clear to Ms Sandhu and others that he would not be discussing any of Dare’s information with Onyx. I accept that D1 did not share information about Dare with Onyx at this time. Similarly, following his resignation, although it is clear that D1 discussed and shared with Onyx his exchanges with Mr Rahman, there is no evidence that he disclosed any of Dare’s confidential information to Onyx.
On 19 November 2023, D1 was sent an offer letter from Onyx. It was explained that the notice period would be 3 months on either side, and that the post-termination restraints would be for 6 months. The contract of employment contained a very generous remuneration package, with a large sign-on bonus and a substantial earn-out bonus. D1 was also provided with an indemnity from Onyx. The indemnity agreement would cover any costs or award incurred by D1 in respect of a claim brought by his former employer in relation to a breach of his employment contract. This would not apply to any claim where the conduct or behaviour of D1 had not been expressly approved or authorised by Onyx in writing. The indemnity was conditional on D1 commencing employment with Onyx on 1 January 2025, unless Onyx did not set up trading operations in Dubai, but D1 was ready, willing and able to commence employment there on that date.
The indemnity was subsequently renegotiated on 29 December 2023, amending the commencement date to 1 January 2026. This was required by D1 as a result of the position taken by Mr Rahman that he wanted D1 to work during his notice period. In cross-examination, D1 accepted that the amendment provided him with an element of relief. He stated that: “It relieved the stress of the financial exposure”.
When D1 met with Mr Rahman on 20 November 2023 to inform him of his resignation, he was tearful and emotional. He explained to Mr Rahman that he needed some personal time and a change. This was reflected in the message that Mr Rahman sent to Mr Ooi shortly after D1 had resigned. Mr Ooi asked what D1 had said about his reason for resigning, and Mr Rahman replied: “Personal reasons, health reasons, needs a change… He was in tears”. Mr Rahman said to Mr Ooi that he had asked D1 if he was going to Onyx; D1 said that he could not say, but Mr Rahman would not be surprised if he was. Mr Ooi replied: “would make sense to go there and take over propane in dubai”. Mr Ooi also said that “Interesting that he was in tears, sounds kinda genuine”. Mr Ooi told Mr Rahman to get the solicitors ready to enforce the non-compete in Dubai. Mr Ooi expressed surprise that D1 was “so emotional about it”, to which Mr Rahman said “I think he just genuinely likes us”. This perception of D1 was, in my judgment, a correct assessment of D1’s views towards Dare, and towards Mr Rahman and Mr Ooi as individuals.
Mr Rahman and Mr Ooi discussed how to deal with D1’s departure. There was no suggestion that D1 would be back working on the Propane and Naphtha desks. Mr Rahman said that they had 3 staff members who had “enough knowledge to know what to do”. Mr Rahman expressed the view that “We are gonna be fine. Probably gonna be hard work . . . but we’ll figure it out”. In a further exchange on 6 December 2023, Mr Rahman stated that “Floor is fine . . . We are gonna turn this into something good”.
Following their meeting on 20 November 2023, D1 sent an email to Mr Rahman, thanking him for “being so gracious and understanding” in their meeting, and thanking him “for the last five years at Dare. It has been an absolute pleasure being part of the team”. He attached a letter of resignation.
D1’s resignation letter stated as follows:
“I refer to our meeting at 10:30 this morning when I informed you I had received an offer of employment. For the avoidance of doubt, I confirm that I have also provided the offeror with a copy of paragraph 13 of my contract of employment, in accordance with the requirements of paragraph 1 3(h) of the contract. I told you in the same meeting that I had decided to accept the offer.
I really appreciate the gracious way you responded to my news. In particular, I am grateful for your understanding that I have made my decision for a mixture of reasons after really careful thought and I cannot be persuaded to change my mind.
This letter is my formal written notice to terminate my employment. Under paragraph 6(a) of my employment contract I am required to give the company 12 months' written notice to terminate, therefore my last day of employment will be 20 November 2024.
As you know, apart from doing the requested handover this morning before going home, I have not spoken to any colleagues about my decision other than you and Jono (who, with your permission, I called after I left the office), nor have I said anything to any brokers. As you requested, if anyone contacts me in the next couple of days to ask about my situation, I will simply say that I am taking some time off.
I do want to agree as soon as possible what Dare would like me to say in response to the inevitable questions about my resignation. As I said in our meeting, I am keen that my decision is not seen as reflecting badly on Dare.
I look forward to hearing from you regarding next steps.
Like you, I sincerely hope that we will remain friends and thank you once again for the past five years at Dare”.
The reference to “handover” was to a “risk handover” that Mr Rahman asked D1 to do as an immediate thing. The reference to remaining “friends” was, in my judgment, a genuine reflection of how D1 felt towards Mr Rahman.
Mr Rahman responded to the resignation letter on 22 November 2023. He explained that he was
“very sorry that you have taken the decision to resign, but I am grateful to you for taking the time to inform me in person. I appreciate that the meeting was emotional for you and this was not a decision you have reached lightly.
You have been a highly valued and important employee during your time with Dare, and that continues to be the case as you move into your notice period. I note that you have said that you cannot be persuaded to change your mind about your decision to leave Dare, and I will respect that and not ask you to stay, however, there is a lot of interesting work that you can do over the next 12 months, whilst you are serving your notice period.
Please do take the rest of this week off, but we would like you to come into the office on Monday (27 November 2023), so that we can discuss what the next 12 months will look like and what work you can do that that will be beneficial to both you, and Dare”.
The letter went on to remind D1 of his contractual obligations to Dare, and that he remained subject to all of his “fiduciary duties as a senior employee of Dare”.
Mr Rahman met with Mr Murley to discuss D1’s resignation. Mr Murley gave Mr Rahman an update as to the capabilities of the various members of the “Light Ends Team” (the description of those working on the Propane and Naphtha desk), and gave some advice as to how they should be spoken to by Mr Rahman. Mr Murley suggested that the matter should be
“frame[d] as a ""1 year intense preparation before going to war"". Need them to fully believe they can dominate the LE market before Stephen gets back and crowd him out (punish him even?)”.
It was clear from this remark that Mr Murley did not anticipate that D1 would be returning to his trading job on the Propane and Naphtha desk during the notice period. It also reflects the rivalry between Dare and Onyx. Mr Rahman responded to say that he would speak to the members of the team one-to-one “because I feel that this impacts them all slightly differently.” Mr Rahman told Mr Murley that he was “genuinely excited” about the way forward with the team.
D1 met with Mr Rahman on 27 November 2023. In advance of that meeting, Mr Rahman had written to D1 to say “just to be clear, you are still a Dare employee and owe all the same duties - including attendance at work”. At the meeting, Mr Rahman requested D1 to attend the office as normal the following day. D1 did not commit to doing this and indicated that he had medical appointments booked over the course of the coming week. Mr Rahman said he could take time off to attend any health-related appointments.
At their meeting, Mr Rahman explained the tasks that he wished D1 to perform during the initial stages of the notice period and set them out in writing later that evening in an email:
“The initial tasks that I would like you to carry out, are:
Propane Desk tasks
Prepare full write-ups of all the Propane strategies that Dare has been pursuing. This should include a full summary of all the strategies you use on the Propane desk, as well as the thinking and reasoning behind each strategy.
Prepare a breakdown of the [redacted] statistical analysis method and the reasoning behind that.
Prepare a summary of the Propane brokers you work with, including who they are, the interests they manage, their behaviour and anything that it would be helpful to know from an inter-personal perspective.
[Other sector] Desk tasks
Research marketing strategies for the [exchange] for the following product sectors: [6 sectors identified]
The marketing strategies should include:
Inter-dealer broker and category 1/2/3 broker analysis and recommendations for coverage and interaction.
Direct trading opportunities.
Broker screen analysis.
Daily volume by hour (busy periods etc analysis).
Volatility of each product and any correlations.
Hedging strategies / large ticket hedging strategies.
[exchange] select bid / offer vs broker market analysis.
Settlement methodology.
Main sources of data - what should be used i.e. Bloomberg, broker screens, tray port etc.
[confidential] methodology including historical ticker analysis.
Any possibilities for inter product arbitrage.
Any opportunities for financial vs physical arbitrage.
Cross exchange arbitrage opportunities.
[redacted trading strategies].
Analysis of market participants.
Fundamental analysis of main price drivers.
Proprietary trade analysis with regards to high and low levels on all traded structures within each product.
Any seasonality / [redacted] price structure analysis.
Tail risks of trading each product.
Recommendation for book structure including inter product spreads.
As discussed, I suggest that we sit down each four-month period to discuss and agree your tasks for the next four-month period. Some other tasks that you could do later in your notice period could be leading the Sales Desk strategy and potentially trading on another desk.”
It can be seen that there was no intention for D1 to return to work on the Propane and Naphtha desk, although there might be the possibility that D1 would trade on another desk later in the notice period. The reference to “the Sales Desk strategy” was to a matter that had been discussed at their meeting. According to the script prepared for the meeting, Mr Rahman told D1 that “A further opportunity I see is leading up the sales desk strategy — I see you being able to turn this side of Dare around and it will also allow you to continue to work with counterparties in the market. I see this as a big opportunity”.
D1 described these tasks as “mundane” and said that he did not have the skill sets or experience to perform them. The tasks may have been somewhat dull for D1 to perform, especially when compared to trading on the markets. Nevertheless, I find that D1 had the skill sets and/or experience to perform them. D1 was well educated (he had gained degrees in Architecture and Mathematics) and he described his approach to the markets as being “analytical”. Much of what D1 was being tasked to do required him to think analytically about different markets.
In his email of 27 November 2023, Mr Rahman also made reference to the fact that D1 had not taken his work phone home with him. This was subsequently sent to his home by Dare. Mr Rahman concluded the email by saying:
“Good to see you this afternoon - and sorry to hear that you haven't been feeling well. Hopefully you'll feel a bit better today as we met just after you had flown back from Berlin”.
D1 responded to this email a couple of hours later, stating as follows:
“As I said at the end of our meeting this afternoon, I do need to take a bit of time out for the sake of my [redacted]. I have told you more than once recently that I am totally exhausted. If there was any doubt about that, my emotional reaction when I met with you last Monday to let you know I had received an offer was a genuine symptom of my level of exhaustion and stress. My taking a weekend break in Berlin was intended to help me relax and unwind a bit. I think your comment about that is unwarranted and if I am honest I feel under even more pressure now.
As I told you this afternoon, I do have some medical appointments booked this week and apart from these I do also need to take a few days away from the office to try to feel better. You have always said that health comes first so I trust you will understand. I will keep you updated but it is my intention to take the rest of this week as sick leave. I will be grateful if you will let HR know so that the absence is properly recorded”.
On 3 December 2023, Mr Murley emailed Mr Ooi, providing him with a debrief of what had taken place in the past two weeks when Mr Ooi had been away on holiday. Under the heading “Team psychology”, Mr Murley wrote:
“I doubt I'm saying anything ground breaking here, but despite external appearances, most of the ELT are feeling vulnerable and, for want of a better work, pretty terrified right now. The majority of them share one particular trait: the pressure they put on themselves. This outweighs anything which the company has put on them, and I have had to mandate holiday for the majority of them at one time or another as they visibly approach breaking point. As an aside, Whoop data proving invaluable here, and already I have intervened to address issues with individuals.
The pressure they feel to perform pushes them into unhealthy behaviours, neglecting self-care, and believing they are accountable for far more than reality dictates. They also have a belief that admitting vulnerability is a weakness which will delay their progression. On the last point, I have managed to break through this barrier with them all, however I don't believe they fully admit their weaknesses to anyone else outside of myself and Holly, so one to always be aware of.
This naturally permeates through the junior ranks to an extent. However, with the new structure, I cannot understate the significance of the opportunity to make changes to the culture and materially improve performance.
With the level and amount of talent in the team, we can now focus on ensuring every trader is doing appropriate hours and has several opportunities to reset during the week. Essentially, I want them to diverge from the belief that the best way to progress is to pull a 14-hour day without a break, 5 days a week. Optimising how they work will improve performance. The corollary to this is that in order to have these benefits, they will need to show the appropriate discipline and rigour in their roles. For the desk to be seen to have traders taking time off in the day or working shifts covering lates to allow others to leave early, they have to show that when at desk, they maintain the highest of standards”.
The reference to Holly was to Holly Bosson. She was a counsellor who had been brought in to work with staff at Dare. It is clear from the evidence that staff at Dare, particularly traders, had experienced ill health from working excessive hours.
D1 had experienced periods of ill health himself as a result of working too hard for Dare. In an email dated 8 February 2021, D1 referred to Dare’s holiday allowance, and said that “I think this needs to be addressed so people are able to/forced to take time off for mental health. I, for example, have taken very little time off in the last 2 years I've been at the firm and I'm exhausted!” There were also other occasions where D1 conveyed to Mr Rahman that he was suffering from working too hard. On 18 January 2023, for instance, D1 conveyed that he was suffering from “exhaustion”, and Mr Rahman told him “to get some rest”.
D1 did not return to work after his meeting with Mr Rahman on 27 November 2023. From 5 December 2023, his absences were covered by letters from his treating physicians. On 5 December 2023, the consultant treating D1’s chronic condition (who I shall refer to as E) wrote “To whom it may concern” that “This patient has been known to me for several years. He has a chronic condition which is now significantly active and impacting on his health. I have advised him to avoid working on medical grounds for four weeks as from week commencing 4 December”.
One month later, on 1 January 2024, D1 emailed Mr Rahman to say: “Unfortunately my symptoms haven't improved and my doctor has instructed me to take a further 4 weeks off. Please find the email from my doctor below. I will of course update you if there is any progress”. The email from E, referred to by D1, was dated 29 December 2023. It stated: “Based on ongoing medical reasons, I have asked you to avoid working for a further four weeks as from and including 2 January”. A formal note, on E’s headed notepaper, was sent to Mr Rahman on 3 January 2024. This stated that:
“Based on ongoing medical reasons I have asked you to avoid working for a further four weeks as from and including 2 January”.
Following receipt of D1’s email, Mr Rahman replied to say:
“I am sorry to hear that you continue to be unwell.
The letters you have provided from your doctor do not set out the actual reason for your absence — your doctor has only said that you have a chronic condition and that you are off for ongoing medical reasons. In line with Dare's sick leave policy, please could you provide a letter from your doctor which sets out details of the reason for your absence and when he expects that you will be fit to return?
I am conscious that you have been working for Dare for almost five years and in that time you have only had 5 days off sick (and these were all over a year ago, in 2022), and now you have eight weeks' sick leave from the commencement of your notice and it is not clear what the reason for this is. I'm mindful that long-term sick leave is something that should be avoided, if possible, and therefore I am keen to see if there are any adjustments that Dare could make to enable you to start working again. Would it be possible (if you haven't already) to speak with your doctor about whether there would be any adjustments that Dare could make that would enable you to return to work (such as a phased return to work, reduced hours etc.) and provide a letter from him on this? If not, then we can arrange an Occupational Health referral for you.”
The reference to 5 days of sickness absence was based on what was recorded on Dare’s internal system. That was not accurate or totally reflective of D1’s sickness absences, however, as some of these absences had been agreed by Mr Rahman directly and had not been recorded.
D1 responded by email sent on 5 January 2024. This stated that:
“The letter I sent you on the 5th December does explain that I have a chronic condition and I have been seeing [E] for several years. You will also have seen that he is a [medical specialty]. . . . I will provide you with an update in due course when I have it and feel better. However, not for the first time, you have made insinuations to question whether or not I am ill. I think this is particularly unreasonable, not only because I have already made clear that it is neither warranted or appreciated, but because you appear to also be questioning the advice of a specialist doctor that has been seeing me for years. In any event, please appreciate that I am finding such repeated comments to be stressful to deal with in circumstances where I am already unwell, so I do hope that they will not continue to be repeated”.
Mr Rahman responded by email on 8 January 2024 to say:
“I, of course, had reviewed your doctor's letter of 5 December 2023 and I appreciate what it says — namely, that you have a chronic condition. Unfortunately, it says nothing further and you will appreciate that this isn't detailed enough for me to understand why you are off sick — and, also, whether you'd be able to do some work if Dare made adjustments to accommodate you.
I am not questioning the advice of a specialist doctor — I just want to understand how this works with respect to ability to work. Would it be possible to speak to your doctor on this?
I can ask HR to schedule an Occupational Health referral which may be simpler?”
In my judgment, Mr Rahman’s correspondence with respect to this matter was totally reasonable. D1 had not had significant periods of sickness absence during his employment at Dare (even if the 5 days recorded on the system was not accurate). Mr Rahman was not aware of D1’s “chronic condition”. The tone of the messages was not hostile. Although it was inquisitive, that was appropriate given the paucity of information that D1 and his specialist were providing to Dare. Mr Rahman was justifiably seeking to understand if there were adjustments that could be made to the working arrangements so that D1 could return to work.
On 11 January 2024, D1 emailed a response. He stated that:
“The condition I have is a [specific] chronic condition with symptoms that flare-up and are exacerbated as a result of being under stress.
You will recall that in the weeks leading up to me handing in my resignation and at the time of resigning I explained that I was feeling mentally exhausted. My doctor has since asked me to take time off work to avoid my condition worsening. Accordingly, I am on sick leave.
You will appreciate that it is, in itself, stressful to have to go back and forth on this issue when I have been advised to take time off.
Thank you for your offer, but I am already seeing a consultant and specialist who is the appropriate person to be assisting me and so I do not need to see anyone else for this condition”.
On 17 January 2024, D1 emailed Mr Rahman. D1 described the various tasks that he had been asked to perform during his notice period. D1 said that he understood that he was “currently on Garden Leave as defined by cl. 7(a) of my contract of employment”, and asked for confirmation that he would be entitled to join any business that he liked after 20 November 2024. The contractual description of “Garden Leave” was not the same as the colloquial understanding of the term “garden leave”, which is the situation when no work is performed by an employee during all of part of the notice period. It is clear that D1 was well aware that he had not been placed on “garden leave” as that term is colloquially used. On 2 April 2024, in an email to his tax advisor with whom he was engaging with respect to his plans to leave the United Kingdom, D1 stated that “I am still employed technically and will be until 2024-November-20 although I have not been in the office nor worked since I resigned on 2023-November-20. I am on sick leave while I am on my Notice period (I have not been put on garden leave). I have been in contact with my lawyers and my boss to discuss my sick leave but I have not done my usual job in the office nor online” (emphasis added).
On 26 January 2024, Mr Rahman responded to D1’s email of 17 January 2024. He informed D1 that “my main concern is your health, and you being well enough to return to work. Please focus on getting better and taking all possible steps to improve your health so that you can start working again — even, as I said, with adjustments. That's why I asked if ok to go to OH — as that's the sort of thing they look at”. Mr Rahman asked D1 to attend an OH (that is, Occupational Health) appointment as he was concerned about “the level of medical advice I have received to date”. He told D1 that he was “excited about the work we can do together during your notice period and I'm keen to get started”.
Mr Rahman then addressed legal matters. He explained that
“You are not on garden leave. You have been on sick leave since 28 November 2023, and you continue to be on sick leave. You have not been placed on any form of leave by Dare”.
Mr Rahman disputed D1’s interpretation of the contract of employment stating that:
“You appear to be suggesting that any direction to perform ""specified services"" during your employment automatically places you on garden leave. This is not correct — and I'm surprised you're making it, particularly whilst on extended sick leave.
It is a ridiculous suggestion - you are still an employee of Dare, and you have a duty to follow reasonable instructions. Unsurprisingly, your contract requires you to perform all the necessary duties associated with your position, as well as ""any other duties"" assigned to you by Dare (clause 3(a)). The same clause says that you understand and agree that your duties and responsibilities may be changed from time to time, reasonably consistent with your skills, experience, and competencies.
It is entirely normal, as an employee approaches the end of their employment, for them to be asked to do slightly different tasks (especially tasks relating to continuity, succession, and transition). But this does not mean that you are on garden leave.
In any event, as you went on sick leave immediately following our meeting on 27 November 2023, you have not actually carried out any such services. Therefore, even on your own suggestion, you could not be on garden leave”.
Mr Rahman asked D1 to confirm that he was not on “Garden Leave”. He also asked D1 to confirm that he was bound by the post-termination restraints.
D1 responded to Mr Rahman on 30 January 2024, and provided him with detail of his health condition. He explained that he had seen a different consultant who had advised him to stay off work for 3 months, in the first instance, whilst he underwent treatment. D1 had met with a consultant (who I shall refer to as F) for consideration of a different medical condition on 22 January 2024. F wrote a letter ‘To whom it may concern’ on that date to say that D1 was unlikely to be fit for work for the next three months while he engages in the necessary treatment. F’s letter said that it might be helpful for D1 to get away from his current situation which would include getting away from London.
The reference in F’s letter to D1 needing to get away had been prompted by D1.  Following the consultation with F, D1 contacted F’s secretary to say that “One thing I forgot to ask is if the doctor approves of me travelling during my sick leave and if so, if she could write me a letter clarifying this so that I do not have any issues in the future with my current employer. Please could you ask her for me?”. On the basis of this exchange, and other matters, Mr Goulding KC, representing Dare contended that F acted as an “advocate” for D1, insinuating that F’s statements as to D1’s condition were not reflective of the real situation. I disagree. F was not merely acting as an “advocate” for D1. Whilst D1 prompted F to add this recommendation to the letter of 22 January 2024, it was entirely consistent with F’s overall opinion as to D1’s condition.
Later on 30 January 2024, Mr Rahman responded to D1 thanking him for providing the letter from his consultant, and told him to take all possible steps to improve his health. Mr Rahman continued:
“It is of course important that you respond to my email of 26 January 2024 so that I can be comfortable that you understand the obligations that you owe to Dare. Hopefully you have chance to absorb this over the next few days and I look forward to hearing from you once you have - obviously I am happy to chat instead if that is easier for you. I will follow up with you on that next week if I don't hear from you.”
On 6 February 2024, Mr Rahman wrote to D1 to say:
“I hope you're feeling okay.
I just wanted to follow up to see if you'd had a chance to consider my email of 26 January? If not, could you let me know when you might be able to respond?
On 9 February 2024, D1 responded to say:
“Thank you for your email. I have not forgotten about your previous email and I will try to get back to you regarding this in the future but for now I really want to focus on my health and I do not know how long this will take”.
On 13 February 2024, Mr Rahman responded to say:
“Thanks for your email and sorry to hear you are still unwell. Please do continue to rest up and follow the advice of your doctor.
As you are not currently well enough to respond to my email, I do think that it would be helpful for you to see Occupational Health so that they can advise whether there are any adjustments that could be made to support a return to work — I am conscious that none of the medical advice you have provided so far has dealt with this and it is important. Occupational Health will be best placed to advise on this, so please can I ask you to sign and return the consent form attached to my email of 18 January 2024? As we have previously discussed, there are a lot of exciting things for you to work on during your notice period and I am looking forward to picking up with you in this regard when you are feeling a bit better.
For the avoidance of doubt, I believe I have already made myself clear but I just want to reiterate — you are not on garden leave (you are on sick leave) and your non-compete restriction will apply for 12 months following the termination of your employment (i.e. until 20 December 2025).
Look after yourself and look forward to catching up in a few weeks.”
On 22 February 2024, Mr Rahman wrote to say:
“Hi Stephen
I just wanted to check in to see how you are doing? I hope the time off work is helping and that you will be able to think about a return to work when your sick note expires in April.
Obviously, your health is our priority. Given you have been signed off work for so long (over five months), I want you to attend an Occupational Health appointment. I have asked you to do this before but I haven't heard back from you. This is an appropriate and reasonable request for me to make. As such, please can you sign and return the consent form that I have previously sent to you. Please could you send this back to me by Wednesday 28 February 2024.
I know before you went off sick that we briefly talked about some possible amended duties for your notice period — you went off sick immediately after this conversation and haven't returned since. I am conscious that your doctor has said that your anxiety is precipitated from your current work situation and given the timing of your sickness absence (immediately following our conversation about potentially amending your duties), I thought it might be helpful for me to re-iterate that the conversation about your notice period was exploratory only, and I am happy for you to continue trading as normal on the Propane desk when you come back to work if that is preferable — of course, if you do not want to do this, I am open to considering letting you carry out other work which is commensurate with your role and seniority (for example, trading on another desk). Obviously, I will still need you to carry out handover-related tasks and train up juniors to take over from you. I really hope this helps to relieve any anxiety flowing from our conversation.
There is a really good opportunity for impact in the Propane market at the moment. If you were well enough to come back and trade on that desk, I would be willing to agree that you could receive a bonus in the usual way, notwithstanding that you are not entitled to a bonus because you are under notice. Of course, I would need certainty from you that you understood and would abide by your restrictive covenants before agreeing to this. Happy to chat about this.
Finally, I note that you left the ""Tech-oil"" work WhatsApp group yesterday afternoon. I know you were using your personal number for that group, so I will add your work number now as I am keen to make sure you stay in the loop generally. It would be good if you can check it every now and again.
As a reminder, while you are out you should still comply with all of Dare's policies, which includes the protection of our confidential information and retaining information on work devices that is relevant to the business.”
The email of 22 February 2024 was the first time following D1’s resignation that Mr Rahman had mentioned the possibility of D1 returning to trade on the Propane market during his notice period. There was a proper rationale for this suggestion. Mr Rahman’s evidence was that he had learned from market contacts on 14 February 2024 that Luke McDermott was no longer trading for Onyx. I accept this evidence as it was referred to by Mr Rahman in a normal business exchange with Mr Murley in which he stated “as an fyi the propane trader from Onyx is out of the market as of yesterday, so we're really the only market maker on note involved currently”. As a result, Mr Rahman considered that Dare had an opportunity to make a lot of money in the Propane market, and he believed that D1 could help Dare take advantage of the situation.
Mr Rahman followed this up on 29 February 2024:
“I hope you are feeling okay and your health is improving.
I just wanted to follow up on my email below, as I haven't received a response from you. Please could you sign and return a copy of the Occupational Health consent form? As per my email below, given your long-term absence, I think it is appropriate and reasonable to obtain some advice from Occupational Health so that I can get a better understanding of your illness and prognosis.
Of course, to the extent you want to discuss anything else in my email below, just let me know and I would be happy to discuss.
Please could you acknowledge receipt of this email?”
D1 responded on 4 March 2024,
“I am writing in response to your emails.
As you know, I'm still signed off work on sick leave. Following my doctors' advice, I am taking some time away from London to try and recuperate. . . .
I would like to confirm that I am not checking work emails or work group WhatsApps and I have not done so since being on sick leave.”
Mr Rahman replied on 6 March 2024:
“Thanks for your email
I totally get you're on sick leave — but hope you appreciate that I've had scant medical information as to why and, more importantly, if there is anything we can do to facilitate a return to work, even on a phased / part time basis.
Could you please therefore sign the Occupational Health consent form and return it to me this week. I consider this a reasonable instruction, especially in light of the comments you have made below.
I will then arrange for an Occupational Health appointment to take place when you are back from your trip. Please could you let me know what date you will be back?
In respect of work emails and WhatsApp, obviously I am not expecting you to be keeping up to date with these on a regular basis, but I do want to make sure you are keeping in the loop generally so that you are in the know when you return. As such, I would like you to check these every now and again to make sure you know what is going on generally.”
On 26 March 2024, Mr Rahman wrote to D1 to say:
“I hope you enjoyed your trip and that you have had time to rest and recuperate.
I'm conscious I never heard back from you in response to my email below, please could you:
• Let me know if you are back from your trip now and if not, confirm when you will be back.
• Sign and return a copy of the Occupational Health consent form I sent to you previously.
• Acknowledge receipt of this email.”
D1 wrote back on 28 March 2024, informing Mr Rahman that he was back from his trip, but still needed a complete break from work. D1 also enclosed a letter from his consultant F dated 27 March 2024, in which she stated that she had reviewed things with D1, and “He continues to be unwell, . . . and cannot recover as communication from work continues whilst he is on sick leave and making symptoms worse. Whilst on sick leave he needs to have no contact from the office about business matters. These contacts are causing prolongation of symptoms and lengthening his sick leave”.
On 30 April 2024, D1 sent Mr Rahman a letter from F explaining that he would not be fit for work for a further 3 months, and that she found it “difficult to see that from a health perspective that he would ever be able to work for this company again”. D1 stated that he would update Mr Rahman further in July when that note had expired. He requested Mr Rahman to “respect the medical advice that I have received and let me recover in peace without further contact from work”.
As can be seen from the correspondence, on repeated occasions D1 had refused to attend an Occupational Health referral as requested by Mr Rahman. This changed on 11 June 2024 when his agreement to attend an appointment with Occupational Health was conveyed to Dare by his solicitors, Farrer & Co., in their response to a letter of claim that had been sent by Dare’s solicitors on 14 May 2024. D1’s solicitors stated that “The repeated demands . . . to see Occupational Health appear nothing more than harassment. Notwithstanding this, [D1] will agree to see Occupational Health”.
During the period following his resignation, D1 travelled considerably. He went to Berlin, Budapest, Mexico, Seoul, Japan, and Bali. D1 also messaged Mr Law on a number of occasions, and they went out for a “night on the town” on at least a couple of occasions. On 4 February 2024, D1 messaged Mr Law to say “How about a drink tomorrow night before we bugger off and get healthy!”. D1 returned home in the early hours of 6 February 2024, having had what he described as an “Awesome night”. After a further night out on 3 April 2024, D1 messaged Mr Law to say “Dead dead dead . .. But bloody good fun . . . I was in bed by 4 [am] and I’m a mess”.  In cross-examination, D1 was asked how this fit with him being too sick to work: he said that the two matters were unrelated, “If anything, meeting a good friend and having a night out takes my mind off things”. I accept this evidence. It was consistent with F’s diagnosis of D1’s condition.
D1 also had many communications with Mr Beckwith during the period from the date of his resignation until his termination from Dare on July 2024. Unlike the WhatsApp messages between Mr Beckwith and D2 which involved detailed exchanges about D2’s interactions with Dare, the messages between D1 and Mr Beckwith are not particularly revealing. What is clear, however, is that they had many substantial WhatsApp audio calls (Footnote: 3), and some of these took place around the time of key communications between D1 and Mr Rahman at Dare. For instance, on 21 February 2024, the day that D1 removed himself from the Dare WhatsApp group for the Propane and Naphtha desk, they had a WhatsApp call which lasted just under 37 minutes. D1 said in evidence that he could not recall talking to Mr Beckwith about leaving WhatsApp groups. I do not accept D1’s evidence and find that they did have such a conversation. The timing of the call and the departure from the WhatsApp group was not a mere coincidence.
D1 made brief notes to himself about some of the various calls. These notes were not particularly revealing to the Court as much of the content had been redacted for the purposes of legal professional privilege. That is presumably because D1’s lawyers were also in attendance on some of the calls. I find that many of the calls with Mr Beckwith involved discussions of strategy and how D1 should deal with and communicate with Dare. That was clearly what took place with D2, and I see no reason why the same did not apply with D1. Onyx had a vested interest in getting D1 to join them as soon as possible.
D1 also had several lengthy communications with Mr Kayaam between his resignation and termination dates. On 20 November 2023, Mr Kayaam asked D1 if he was free for a catch up, to which D1 responded “Now?”. They then had a conversation, as a few hours later, D1 messaged Mr Kayaam to say: “Resignation letter sent. Thanks Omar for all your help. Exciting journey ahead!”. Mr Kayaam subsequently messaged to say: “Let me know when gardening leave is confirmed and we will get the get our team firing away on Dubai licenses and what needs to be done”. I find that the communications between D1 and Mr Kayaam were not simply for social purposes or general updates. They were proximate to key communications with Mr Rahman and undoubtedly involved discussion of those and advice as to what D1 should say or how he should react (Footnote: 4).
There was no evidence of communications between D1 and D2 during this period, and no evidence that D1 ever revealed to D2 whom he was going to work for.
D2’s resignation
On 14 February 2024, D2 resigned from Dare, also giving the required one year’s notice. Prior to his resignation, D2 had been offered a position with Onyx and had negotiated a very remunerative contractual package and indemnity agreement.
D2 had been in discussion with Onyx since the summer of 2023, when he had informal conversations with a crude oil trader at Onyx. On 20 December 2023, D2 met up with Mr Kayaam. On 2 January 2024, Mr Kayaam and D2 had a lengthy WhatsApp exchange about the remuneration package that Onyx would offer D2. This must have been based on information about the profit and loss (“the pnl”) of the Crude Oil desk that D2 had sent through to Onyx at some earlier point, as it was mentioned in the messages between them. Thus, Mr Kayaam stated that:
“greg and i have run through the numbers, on rough projections of what your pnl has been roughly for last 3 years, and come up with a fair proposal for what we would offer as a sign on"".
“greg” was a reference to Mr Newman, Onyx’s Chief Executive Officer.
They also discussed the fact that D1 was moving to Onyx, as this was also reflected in the message sent by Mr Kayaam:
“I wouldn't speak to Stephen [that is: D1] about anything or mention anything as it'll make things messy but we will make sure before you were to resign you and your lawyers are happy with everything and also that, the next steps of legal cover are organised”.
D2 and Mr Kayaam had a call lasting just over 47 minutes on 3 January 2024. They then had a WhatsApp exchange in which D2 referred to the percentage rebate of Dare’s clearing and exchange fees that were reflected in his “pnl”. I will not set out the detail of this message, or some of the other similar messages, in this open judgment as it contains Dare’s confidential information which D2 was sharing with Dare. I will set out the detailed correspondence in the confidential annexe. I do not find that this sharing of information was malicious or intended to harm Dare. Nevertheless, as I will explain, it was still a breach of the duty of fidelity that D2 owed to Dare.
D2 had a further WhatsApp exchange with Mr Kayaam on 4 January 2024. Mr Kayaam asked D2 about the breakdown of his work for Dare “in terms of dated and dubai [that is, Crude products] what % would u say u do on screen compared to broked”, and D2 provided a response. Mr Kayaam’s reply was: “we currently don't have such aggressive deals, on the crude programme, but we will be pushing to get it soon, and additional market share will def mean we get it when or before u start. we have [redacted] on dubai etc”.
On 8 January 2024, D2 sent himself various documents, including the “pnl” document for his desk. This set out the calculation of gross and net profit, and included among other things precise information about the Crude Desk’s Total Revenue, the total brokerage fees, the ICE fees (that is, the fees that Dare paid for its trades on the Intercontinental Exchange, an electronic platform used for the trading of, among other things, energy related products), rebates for ICE fees, the “Admin Charge”, and the Desk Bonus Pool. In a WhatsApp exchange on 17 January 2024, D2 said to Mr Kayaam:
“I just wanted to be clear what would be the annual desk trading fixed cost?
He told Mr Kayaam what he was currently “paying” Dare as his fixed cost: that is, the sum that was taken off his revenues for the purpose of calculating his bonus.
On 31 January 2024, D2 had a WhatsApp exchange with Mr Beckwith. The conversation included the following:
“D2: “Hi, thanks for the update. I was hoping to ask a question regarding the strategy should we get to the point I hand in my notice. Essentially I was looking to know if you would expect me to need to work after that point? More for my personal logistics will need to book a trip to Dubai potentially over the half term break. Appreciate you might not have the answers yet.”
Mr Beckwith: “We are keen for you to resign asap. Obviously want you to be happy (ie sign) the offer docs”.
D2: “More to say once I have resigned if they ask me to work my notice do you think I wouldn't need to under the current plan”.
Mr Beckwith: “We need a session to discuss strategy so that you are happy with next steps”.
D2: “Agreed. When do you think would be the right time to go through that?”.
Mr Beckwith: “Next week”.
D2: “Ok great. Will hold off booking any trips till we go through that. Thanks and look forward to catching up soon.”
Whilst these exchanges were taking place between D2 and Onyx, D2 was discussing with Mr Rahman “a new crude business line” for Dare. D2 had agreed to create a “business plan for a new crude business line detailing the roles and skill gaps we need to fill”. As far as Mr Rahman was concerned, D2 was still committed to working for Dare.
On 6 February 2024, D2 had a WhatsApp exchange with Mr Beckwith in which Mr Beckwith asked whether D2 could meet that week with Mr Kayaam to “go through [a] few things”. It was explained that, in addition, “Omar wants to check in with you for support considering next big step for you to tell Ayman.” They met the following day, and D2 had a further meeting with Mr Beckwith on 12 February 2024.
On 13 February 2024, D2 received his offer letter from Onyx. Later that day, D2 met with Mr Rahman to inform him that he was resigning from Dare. D2 told Mr Rahman that he was leaving to pursue an opportunity in Dubai: he did not tell him that it was with Onyx. D2 explained that his wife was extremely upset and had never forgiven Mr Rahman for what had happened over Dubai. This sentiment was reflected in the email that D2 sent to Mr Rahman the following day confirming the decision to resign from Dare.
Before meeting with Mr Rahman to inform him of his resignation, D2 had a WhatsApp call with Mr Beckwith for 8 minutes or so. This had been preceded by a series of WhatsApp messages, including one in which D2 asked Mr Beckwith to “remind me of any key points for the meeting with Ayman”. After D2’s meeting with Mr Rahman, D2 messaged Mr Beckwith to say that: “Brokers already asking questions. Better to just not reply I guess as still too early?”. In reply, Mr Beckwith said “Maybe leave replies to the brokers tomorrow”. D2 then informed Mr Beckwith about his holiday that had been approved for a few days, and asked whether he could “go abroad with the family”. He also mentioned that brokers were asking him where he was on “bids/offers” and he asked whether he could “just say please speak to the junior?” Mr Beckwith replied by saying that D2 could go anywhere he wanted to while on booked leave, and that his junior had “to handle trading questions- and he should defer to Ayman if he gets stuck”.  This exchange was typical of the communications between D2 and Mr Beckwith during the notice period. D2 sought advice and guidance from Mr Beckwith about how he should conduct himself and how he should deal with correspondence from Mr Rahman.
After D2 had informed Mr Rahman of his resignation, he also messaged Mr Kayaam to say that he was “extremely excited to join Onyx and looking forward to contributing for many more years to come. Thank you for the opportunity”. Mr Kayaam asked D2 if he would be travelling. He responded “Honestly not planned anything yet but definitely will have to do something serious. Don't think I'm going to have this opportunity again for a very long time”. Later that evening, D2 and Mr Khayam had a WhatsApp call.
Also that evening, D2 messaged Mr Beckwith to say that he had just received something from Mr Rahman. Mr Beckwith messaged back to say
“It is up to you ie how you feel about going back in. Personally I would just to get closure. Or you could reply and say that you are out tonight and will call him in the morning .. whichever way, I will guide you.”
D2 responded with
“Honestly I would rather not want to go in at this point I kind of have mentally closed that chapter off. And given that I said how upset I was about things I think it could be fair to say that I am not keen to come back.  Not sure what you think. I also think he will be better prepared this time and won't be to any advantage”.
Mr Beckwith replied, saying
“Yep, just text him and say you are out with your family because they are relieved you have resigned. Say that you will call him in the morning.”
D2 told Mr Beckwith that he had messaged Mr Rahman, to which Mr Beckwith responded: “if he gets heavy saying you must come in - then I will cover that in your resignation letter.” In reply, D2 asked: “Will I actually need to call him? Is there any benefit to us at this stage? I feel I covered it all and just Incase we can use the letter to cover it off?” Mr Beckwith answered, saying “Very unlikely to have a call and the letter will create a disconnect effect”.
Mr Rahman responded to D2’s message, and this was forwarded to Mr Beckwith. Mr Beckwith described Mr Rahman’s response as “Slippery. And predictable. . . . All games.” D2 told Mr Beckwith that he was not going to respond to Mr Rahman’s message, “Unless you think I should”.  Mr Beckwith said: “Don't respond”. This pattern of messaging was repeated over the next month or so. D2 would share with Mr Beckwith the correspondence that he received from Mr Rahman, and then Mr Beckwith would provide D2 with wording for a reply. This was reflected in their exchange the following day.
In the morning of 14 February 2024, Mr Beckwith messaged D2, telling him that a letter was coming from his personal email and asking for D2’s personal email. Mr Beckwith asked D2 to “cut and paste into your personal email and send” it to Mr Rahman, copying in his personal email. D2 told Mr Beckwith that he was happy with the letter that had been drafted. D2 informed Mr Beckwith that he had received an email from Mr Rahman; in response, Mr Beckwith said “Games. Send the email and it will change everything . . .  Your stance will be that relationship is broken”. Mr Beckwith told D2 to ignore Mr Rahman’s earlier email. Mr Beckwith also said that D2 should “Expect Ayman to wriggle out of Dubai not materialising. His lawyer will use excuses in their response. All part of the game. The key point from your side will be that having made your decision after considerable pain there is no point going back in when the relationship is broken.” Mr Beckwith informed D2 that “you will get a snotty letter tomorrow from Dare reminding you of your duties etc.... All just idle threats.”  Mr Beckwith informed D2 that “the fun and games will begin. As you know, [Mr Law] just disengaged from the nonsense. But whatever nonsense comes, we will deal with it.” D2 replied: “Sounds like a good approach”.
The resignation letter that Mr Beckwith had penned for D2 and was sent to Mr Rahman contained the following:
“As I explained yesterday, I was expecting to transfer my employment and relocate to Dubai last year with my wife and family as planned and agreed with you. My wife and I have continued to be filled with disappointment because this relocation never transpired. [I] cannot emphasise enough how important the move to Dubai was to me and my wife. Unfortunately, I have been unable to get over the immense disappointment caused by the way in which the Dubai relocation was handled.
From my perspective, I do not see how it is possible to salvage my relationship with the company given what happened last year. The relocation to Dubai represented a major event in my life, and when it did not materialise, the impact and disappointment was inordinate.
Having made the decision to resign I can now focus on pursuing other career opportunities in Dubai.”
D2 asked Mr Beckwith what he should say to brokers. Mr Beckwith said that “Personally i would wait for a response from ayman to your letter but by the end of the day yes to messages from brokers saying you are leaving but be cautious… Who you respond to ie close relationships first”. D2 asked what he should do about his internet provider as this was paid for by Dare. Mr Beckwith replied that “If you are using your provider extensively for personal [use], then maybe switch. But honestly don't worry too much”.
Later that evening, D2 passed on the response that he had received from Mr Rahman. In this response, Mr Rahman expressed surprise at D2’s resignation, noting that they had been chatting “over the last couple of weeks regarding future plans and strategy during which you appeared fully engaged in our go forward plans.” Mr Rahman also stated that:
“I get that you were disappointed that the move to Dubai didn't ultimately materialise, but you must realise that Dare invested significant funds to make Dubai a possibility for you and others. We did this because you asked me to — not because I wanted a move to Dubai. And given this, we obviously sought contractual assurances from those considering the move — which you ultimately did not accept.
This all happened some time ago and we've since been focused on the success at Dare which you've been invested in — indeed you signed up to be a Growth shareholder in Dare after this issue which demonstrated your long term commitment to Dare. We were also recently discussing your future and aspirations within Dare. The below email does not sound like you and does not ring true.”
Mr Rahman reminded D2 of his 12 month notice period and said that, for at least the next six months, D2 was to continue trading on the Crude desk in his current role, which required him to be in the office as normal. He also said he wanted D2 “to focus on training up at least one Senior Associate / Associate Trader on the Crude desk, so that they can take over the desk when you eventually leave”. Mr Rahman suggested that during the summer they would consider what would happen in the remainder of the notice period. Mr Rahman noted that D2 had not been in the office that day and said that he did not know why. He asked D2 to be in the office the following day. With respect to his new employment, Mr Rahman asked D2 to confirm if he had applied for or been offered any employment, engagement or consultancy with any other company. If he had, he wanted confirmation that D2 had provided them with a copy of his post-termination restraints. Mr Rahman informed D2 that he continued to owe fiduciary obligations to Dare as well as other contractual obligations. D2 was asked to confirm that he did not have any Dare documents on any personal devices and that he had not shared any Dare information with any third parties. Mr Rahman also drew D2’s attention to the terms of the post-termination restrictions.  He stated that these prevented D2 from joining any company that is competitive to Dare, anywhere in the world, for 12 months: until 14 February 2026. D2 was asked to confirm that he understood this restriction and would abide by it. Mr Rahman concluded the letter stating that he looked forward “to chatting all this through and moving forward constructively — exciting times ahead and you're still very much part of Dare”.
After D2 had told Mr Rahman on 13 February 2024 that he was resigning from Dare, Mr Rahman contacted Mr Ooi to give him the news. Mr Ooi asked what reasons D2 had given for leaving, and Mr Rahman said “Dubai falling through. Created a lot of issues for him at home. And alluded to other firms offering softer worded contracts”. Mr Ooi replied to say: “Guess going with Stephen and Tom out to dubai, probably onyx I guess”. He added, “Can't believe this dubai shit has created so much beef”.
Mr Ooi asked Mr Rahman what he wanted to do about the Crude Oil desk. They discussed putting two traders, Erman Afzali or Amir Abbou, into D2’s seat as a “stopgap”. Mr Ooi realised that Mr Abbou was signed off sick, so asked Mr Rahman whether there was “anyone else that would understand how to derisk that book initially?” Mr Rahman replied, “Only maybe Erman - but we're gonna ask Ash [that is, D2] to work his notice . . . Ok I think as a initial favour we should ask ash to derisk his book as much as possible at the front”. Other personnel were mentioned as assisting with the desk: Max Glen-Doepel, a Graduate Training Analyst, and Comrooze Zandiyeh.
Mr Rahman also contacted Mr Murley to inform him that D2 had resigned. This was described by Mr Rahman as “an additional spanner/opportunity”. Mr Rahman also explained that the immediate plan was to move Mr Afzali to the desk, and probably to move Mr Zandiyeh there once Mr Abbou was back. Mr Murley said that “I think if we offered [Mr Abbou] Crude he'd jump at it”.
It is clear from the contemporaneous correspondence that immediate steps were taken by Dare to try to safeguard the operations of the Crude Oil desk. Whilst it was not known if D2 would return to work, the initial intention of Mr Rahman was that D2 would be asked to trade by derisking his book. It was not the case, as was suggested to Mr Rahman in cross-examination, that there was never an intention of having D2 back in a trading role. I find that Mr Rahman was not merely “pretending” when he requested D2 to carry on trading during his notice period.
Mr Rahman and Mr Ooi paid close attention to the Crude Oil desk, and were provided with regular reports of the trades that were being done. Advice was given by Mr Rahman to the traders. On 19 February 2024, for instance, in a Teams Chat for the Crude Oil Desk, Mr Rahman advised that they should “think about what strategies you think the market makers (particularly Onyx) are running around CFDs into the platts window and see if you can start dipping your toes”. In addition, Mr Rahman said that “We should get you all of Ash's historic trade activity, particularly his biggest pnl days (particularly live pnl) and analyse our market share on those days too... The aim being to figure out the trading strategy from looking at the trade history” and indicated that Mr Ooi would be able to assist with this. According to a comment made by Mr Ooi in a Teams Chat sent on 15 March 2024, he was spending “maybe 1/3 of time” focussing on the Crude desk.
A similar message was sent by Mr Rahman to Mr Afzali on 22 February 2024, in which he stated:
“Keep a close eye on your market share. Compare it to what Ash was active in as a starting point. Look at which products his activity was concentrated in.
If you haven't already- you need to also closely analyse his trading activity yourself over the last few years. See what trade cycles he's done via the trade feed, look at his biggest pnl days, try to figure out if it's live pnl or overnight or what products. Yes it's a bit of work to unpick this, but the value in accelerating your trading is massive. If you need help with formatting or access to information work with Jono who can assign recourse to help you.
Let's also get you a daily report showing how much brokerage we spent, and comparing it to what we used to do when Ash was around. Ultimately the aim is to get back there and then beat those activity levels whilst making good pnl. I've cc'd Ugo & Chris to assist.
None of this will happen overnight, but it's good to know where we want the desk to get to.
Really think hard as a team why our competitors are doing the trades they do. Having established traders in the market is actually one of the best ways to learn, establish views on the market, and slowly build your own spin on it to take your trading to the next level. Imitation is easier than innovation.
First step is to figure out how other are making money and copy it. After that we innovate.
Good job on doing some [redacted]  business, next time I want an even higher % of the total traded”.
It was suggested by Niran de Silva KC, acting on behalf of D2, that these exchanges indicated that D2 did not use confidential information when trading on the Crude Oil desk; that D2’s trading patterns and decisions were part of his general skill and knowledge which could be replicated by others merely by analysing past performance. I agree with the general proposition that D2 did use his general skill and knowledge in making trading decisions, and that analysis of his trading patterns could assist others in making trading decisions of their own. That does not mean, however, that D2 did not have access to or use Dare’s confidential information when making any of his trading decisions, as I shall explain further below.
On 14 February 2024, there was an email exchange between a recruitment consultant and a Dare employee about a request from Mr Rahman to headhunt a gas and power trader. The base salary of the individual concerned would be between “120-125k but open depending on the candidate”. Further details of the specification were provided on 16 February 2024: bonus of a particular percentage range. The employee would report to Mr Rahman and Mr Ooi. They need to understand how a curve works, like a market maker. It was stated that Mr Rahman was looking for someone who understands markets properly, but may not have “risk ownership in their current role (maybe as their senior is in charge)”. In terms of output, there was reference to the size of the “pnl” that they wished to be at within one year and by year 2/3.
In his oral evidence, Mr Rahman said that the person who was recruited was not a replacement for D2, but was a proprietary trader. The role that they were advertising for, he said, was not for liquidity provision which was the core of the work that D2 had been doing for Dare. The person who was actually recruited, Mr Aadil Khan, was given the title of Portfolio Manager- Fundamental Trading. Mr Rahman said that this was a new desk for Dare. Mr Khan’s starting date was 19 June 2024. I do not reach a conclusion as to whether or not Mr Khan was a replacement for D2 as this is not necessary for my decision on liability.
As for the impact of D2’s departure, it was believed by Mr Ooi and Mr Rahman that, with the right staffing, the Crude Oil Desk could be more profitable without D2. This was reflected in a WhatsApp exchange on 19 February 2024, in which Mr Ooi said to Mr Rahman: “I reckon if we put a good trader on crude we’d make a lot more than [D2], and it’s more like a 2 maybe even 3 trader + grad desk imo”. Nevertheless, in an email dated 26 February 2024 (see below at paragraph 142), Mr Rahman stated that the desk was down by a particular amount since D2 had stopped working. In a Teams chat on 27 March 2024, Mr Cammell informed Mr Ooi that Mr Rahman had mentioned that
“we should record how much pnl we have lost since Ash left to yesterday on crude (around [redacted amount] he thinks)
This loss has all come from derisking losses, please could you share on exactly what positions while it's still fresh in your mind. Ayman mentioned a lot of this is from . . . losses, and . . . spreads, and . . . [redacted] which AH left on the portfolio.
Ayman mentioned we should be able to evidence the position and the price changes from AH's leaving date to yesterday to give a clear sense on how much this stuff cost Dare.”
Mr Ooi looked into the matter and produced a document on 3 April 2024. He explained that “its a [redacted]  loss on CFDs, [redacted]  on BFOE, and [redacted]  on DFLs”.
Returning to the chronology of the exchanges between Mr Rahman and D2 and the involvement of Mr Beckwith after D2’s resignation, D2 messaged Mr Beckwith on 15 February 2024 to tell him that he had a home computer, a laptop, and a work mobile belonging to Dare. He asked Mr Beckwith if he should still be checking his work phone.  They subsequently had an audio call for just under 30 minutes. In a further WhatsApp exchange after their call, D2 asked whether he could meet up with a couple of brokers who had made contact with him, and Mr Beckwith said not to. Mr Beckwith also told D2 that he would send him a letter first thing, adding “Just want our lawyers to check”. D2 responded: “No problem whatever is best. Thanks. Starting to already feel very angry about how long this non-compete is for seems very unfair. I can't believe I was pressured into signing it. Anyway appreciate all the effort thus far.”
On 16 February 2024, D2 messaged Mr Beckwith to ask him about getting visas for Dubai. D2 said that “we would ideally like to start my daughter in September at school there. Would it be possible to get visas in time for June/July to secure rentals etc and schooling? Completely appreciate if not but would be useful to understand timeframe so we can plan”. Later that day, Mr Beckwith messaged D2 to tell him that he had sent him an email response to Mr Rahman which he should “copy and paste”. D2 asked Mr Beckwith about mentioning the work phone and home computer and Mr Beckwith said that they would do this in a following email.  D2 also said that he would like to discuss with Mr Beckwith or Mr Khayam about “what happens now”.
The email that was sent to Mr Rahman was as follows.
“Your comments about me not moving to Dubai are bewildering and attempt to diminish the significance of the matter. While the matter in question happened last year, I remain deeply disappointed with the way Dare handled the whole situation (especially the outrageously unfair and draconian contract that you expected me to sign to move to Dubai). You are also ignoring the fact that my wife and I had set everything in place to move our family to Dubai (including arranging schools). I hoped that my wife and I would get over the disappointment of feeling let down, but this has not been possible. My wife and I had many arguments about the whole situation for months. It is not helpful or healthy for me and my wife to continue feeling this level of apathy towards my job. This is why I must resign. You are mistaken about me and how I feel about the situation.
To the extent that I have received an offer of employment I confirm that I have adhered to my contractual obligations pursuant to clause 13”.
Mr Rahman replied a few hours later, saying that he did not think that the email correspondence was “constructive”. He requested D2 to come into the office on Monday morning (19 February 2024), as he thought it would be “more productive and helpful “for them to meet “in person”. Mr Rahman reminded D2 that he was “a very senior employee of Dare and you have been remunerated accordingly. You have a 12-month notice period and as per my last email, there is a lot of exciting work to do during that time”.
D2 shared that reply with Mr Beckwith. Mr Beckwith’s response to Mr Rahman’s email was “Hilarious! Temper tantrum”. D2 asked if there was anything to reply to, adding “Seems like he's just wasting time”. D2 went on to say that “It's crazy because when Stephen left (that is: D1) he said to all the seniors individually he was going to basically constructively dismiss him to make him work in another role to ensure he spent 2 years out of the market and now he’s trying to do it to me” (emphasis added). Mr Beckwith responded by saying that “Well, that is a lousy strategy if he wants to do that with you or stephen. Think we are dealing with some clowns their end. Embarrassing and emotional”. D2 said that he would wait to hear from Mr Beckwith as to what or whether to respond. Mr Beckwith replied: “Yep, will figure it out. He thinks he can manipulate you. That email to you was a rant. He is cracking very quickly”.
I find that, following D1’s resignation, Mr Rahman did say to D2 that he was going to make D1 work in another role to ensure that he spent 2 years out of the market, and said something about how he would be treating D1 which D2 interpreted as amounting to D1’s constructive dismissal. Not only was this mentioned by D2 in this exchange with Mr Beckwith, but it was consistent with what D2 said to Mr Law in their conversation at the Oka restaurant on 8 May 2024, a conversation which D2 did not know was being taped or would be subject to scrutiny at trial. At Oka, D2 told Mr Law: “what did it for me actually, what really pushed me over the edge was when Stephen resigned, and he was like, he took us to a side and basically said ""I'm going to fuck ..trying to [inaudible] him [inaudible] for 2 years"". Like that was the final straw for me, this guy is literally just...”.
On 18 February 2024, Mr Beckwith contacted D2 in the morning and asked if he was free for a call. They spoke in the late afternoon for just under 45 minutes. After the call, Mr Beckwith messaged to say “Doubt you will need to go into the office. Let's play be ear. Hopefully, he will send a strong message to you demanding that you take a new role. If he does, then good news for you in terms of removing yourself from any further discussion”.
In his email to Mr Rahman sent at 8:18pm, D2 informed him that he was away with his family, but would be back on Tuesday. He continued with:
“I am not sure what to make of your last email. At first glance, it reads as unnecessarily patronising. Nonetheless, I will come into the office on Tuesday to meet you. Please let me what time you would like to meet.”
In the morning of 19 February 2024, D2 had a WhatsApp exchange with Mr  Beckwith. D2 asked whether he should message Dare’s IT guy for them to collect their stuff or should wait. Mr Beckwith said “just wait . . . all games”. D2 received a message from Mr Rahman and forwarded it to Mr  Beckwith. D2 commented: “More of the same tbh”. The message from Mr Rahman (sent at 10:58am) contained the following:
“Thanks for your email — my email wasn't intended to be patronising — I am trying to move things along in a constructive manner and ensure that we continue to have an effective working relationship during your notice period.
Let's catch up at 10:45am tomorrow morning in my office. It is up to you whether you come in before that meeting or not, but after our meeting I will be expecting you to continue with your role. That means getting back to your desk and getting on with things. Obviously, we will want you to have one eye on training people up for after you go.”
On reading the message from Mr Rahman sent at 10:58 am, Mr Beckwith said “The guy is delusional”. D2 said “Keen to get this done to be honest. Thanks for the help”. Mr Beckwith replied: “He obviously thinks he can dominate you and order you back to work. Strange guy”. D2’s response was “It's ridiculous”. D2 questioned: “How could I go back to earn sub standard living not doing my job.” Mr Beckwith responded with: “It is strange that he has taken the weakest position possible in terms of a strategy. Peculiar. Good for us and you though”. They subsequently had an audio call for 22 minutes. After the call, Mr Beckwith sent D2 an email, which D2 said he would “copy and paste”. D2 commented that the response drafted by Mr Beckwith “summarises things well. Thanks. Let's just hope it draws this to a conclusion.”
D2’s email was sent at 7:10 pm. It read:
“I have just returned from leave and seen your email.
It is beyond belief that you would expect me to sit on the desk tomorrow and resume trading as though nothing has happened. It feels like you are dismissing my reasons for leaving with ridicule. In any case, expecting me to trade after resigning is a situation offering no possibility of a favourable outcome. Whether my desk incurs losses or generates strong PnL, it will not benefit me.
As demonstrated in the last few days, the desk can run without me. Many of the brokers in the market know that I am leaving Dare (presumably someone from Dare has already told them).
I am not comfortable coming into the office to discuss this with you. From my perspective, it now seems that the intention is to make an example of me in front of the other employees because I am leaving Dare (albeit extremely disgruntled).”
Mr Rahman responded to this email at 21:09. He said:
“That is not the intention - the intention is absolutely to get the most out of your notice period. I presumed your preference would be doing the same role. Happy to discuss that. We can't afford to lose your expertise. As you know this is extremely damaging to Dare and I expect you to honour your notice period.
Please come in tomorrow and we can chat it through - always better in person. Also happy to meet outside in a coffee shop if that's easier for you?”
D2 forwarded the response from Mr Rahman to Mr Beckwith. Mr Beckwith’s immediate reaction was that Mr Rahman “is going to cut you a deal to leave”. D2 replied to say that “Ok I'm still maybe less optimistic. Just have cautious scepticism. Look forward to speaking tomorrow morning. Will await our chat before I reply with a time to go in etc”. Mr Beckwith replied with “I am so sceptical, and will always over analyse but there is a predictable position he is playing. Speak in the morning”.
D2 had a call with Mr Beckwith the following morning, 20 February 2024, for nearly 52 minutes. Later that day, D2 forwarded an email that Mr Rahman had sent to him, commenting “Makes me feel more confident it wouldn't have been a constructive meeting”. Mr Rahman’s response (sent to D2 at 5:21 pm) stated that:
“You didn't turn up for our meeting today or send me anything to tell me you would not be attending. It is not acceptable to ignore my emails or refuse to meet with me. As mentioned below, I do expect you to work your notice period and to continue to engage with me.
Please come in to meet with me tomorrow at 10:30. As per my email below, if you would prefer to meet outside the office before coming in, then let me know and we can do this.
Please acknowledge receipt of this email and confirm that you will attend the meeting tomorrow”.
D2 forwarded this email to Mr Beckwith, who responded with some text for D2 to put in an email to Mr Rahman:
“I have already explained my position and reasons for resigning. These email interactions are becoming increasingly hostile and indicate that a meeting in person could become challenging, if not argumentative. I will take legal advice and will respond accordingly”.
D2 sent this email to Mr Rahman at 6.23pm.
Mr Beckwith commented on Mr Rahman’s message of 5:21pm: “It is like you are a naughty child.. to him.. incredible cheek to write to you in the way he does”; to which D2 responded: “I feel like I'm back at school being told off”.  Mr Beckwith told D2 that: “these guys are not respecting you.. Enough is enough”. D2 asked Mr Beckwith: “What do you think is the next step”. Mr Beckwith replied: “Hopefully he will lose his mind and send an absolutely horrible message”. D2 responded: “I think we chose the right path to be honest the way this guy is speaking makes me think it would have been a wasted meeting which I would have minded but just a waste of energy and time.” Mr Beckwith replied: “What he should do ie properly and correctly, is apologise and start again. Doubt he will, which plays into your hands. It is called poke the bear on purpose. Ego vs logic. Logic prevails!”. D2 remarked that “That one was definitely a heated email from him. Anyway thanks for the help. Will keep you posted”.
Late in the evening of 21 February 2024, D2 informed Mr Beckwith that he was seeing “a daily journal sent to my email of all the trades Erman is doing who was the associate trader I trained. It looks like he is managing fine in terms of de-risking the book. Can I use any of these emails to help us? Guess not”. D2 also notified Mr Beckwith that he had received a further email from Mr Rahman and he forwarded it on. Mr Beckwith said that they would discuss it the following morning, and commented that “He kept emailing Stephen. Similar pattern of behaviour”.   Mr Beckwith stated that Mr Rahman “is stuck repeating the same nonsense.. quite pathetic really. No substance.. will deal with it.” D2 commented: “This to me seems ludicrous”.
The email that Mr Rahman had to D2 sent was as follows:
“I am simply asking you to work your notice period —this is an entirely normal and standard request for an employer to make.
I note that you are taking legal advice. Please do this and respond as soon as possible, but in any event, by no later than Wednesday 28 February 2024.
In the meantime, I repeat my point that you are a senior employee, you have a contractual notice period and I want you to work it — there is loads to do and you being out is really hurting us financially.
As a reminder, while you are out you should still comply with all of Dare's policies, which includes the protection of our confidential information and retaining information on work devices that is relevant to the business. Please can you respond to my question (in my email of 14 February 2024) and confirm that you do not have any Dare documents on any personal devices, and that you have not shared any Dare documents with any third parties?”.
On 22 February 2024, Mr Beckwith and D2 messaged about material to put in a response to Mr Rahman’s latest email. During the course of their messaging, D2 asked: “If they have 5 staff on my desk of multiple levels of seniority. How is it I'm not allowed to trade? It's just my earnings that seem to be taking a hit in terms of not being able to earn a bonus etc. surely a court would see that? Curious to hear from your perspective”. Mr Beckwith responded: “He is implying in his emails that he wants you to work. But that could mean trading or some bullshit job. He isn't being clear”. D2 replied: “No I meant start working for onyx now . . . Seems grossly unfair that in theory I can't earn my normally living whilst they can trade as normal just curious to hear the legal perspective”. This reference to “legal perspective” indicates that D2 thought that Mr Beckwith was some kind of lawyer, or at least had knowledge of legal matters.
Mr Beckwith sent D2 an email to respond to Mr Rahman’s latest message to him. Before sending it on to Mr Rahman, D2 asked Mr Beckwith: “Should I leave the WhatsApp groups now? On my personal phone?”. Mr Beckwith said that that is what he would do. D2 said that he would do that before sending the email to Mr Rahman. D2 explained to Mr Beckwith what property of Dare he retained. They then had a call for over 11 minutes. They also spoke again the following morning for just over 8 minutes.
Mr Rahman emailed D2 on 23 February 2024 at 11:12 am. This was before D2 had sent on the email that Mr Beckwith was drafting for him. In his email, Mr Rahman stated:
“I have noticed that you left the 'Tech-oil"" work WhatsApp group last night. As you know, you are still employed and you are not on any form of leave, therefore it is important that you remain on the WhatsApp group so you can stay up to date. I am adding your work mobile number to the group this morning.
Please respond and confirm that you will keep your work mobile on and that you will regularly check your emails and the WhatsApp group.”
D2 forwarded this email to Mr Beckwith. They discussed some revised wording for D2 to send back. D2 commented on the draft that Mr Beckwith sent over, suggesting some changes to the wording: “So can we reword the first paragraph? Perhaps to say will no longer access from this point on? Or better am no longer using”. D2 sent the revised draft back to Mr Beckwith and asked him if it was “OK”. D2 commented: “But you saw he's going to re add me to a WhatsApp group”, to which Mr Beckwith replied: “Pointless. The guy is an idiot”. D2 responded: “lol”. They had further discussion about the wording of the email and what Mr Rahman had said in his email. D2 said: “The only thing is the comment about dare not being financially hit he could say I would have earnt them more if I was there”. Mr Beckwith said that Mr Rahman was saying that D2 had “lost them money. Which is an insult and unfair”, to which D2 replied: “Agreed”.
D2 sent his email to Mr Rahman on 23 February 2024, at 12:15 pm. It stated the following:
“This email is to confirm that I am no longer using company-issued devices and equipment in my possession. This includes a work iPhone, a work desktop pc with accessories, a Bloomberg b-unit, a work pass, and a work laptop with accessories. I have left all WhatsApp groups and I do not have access to company emails on my personal devices or by any other means. All electronic items that are the property of Dare are powered down and are available for collection.
Except for my own personal employment-related documentation from Dare, I do not have any other confidential and proprietary printed documents belonging to Dare in my possession. I understand my implied duty of confidentiality in addition to those duties that are expressly stated in my employment contract. I take these duties extremely seriously. I understand that Dare must protect its commercially sensitive information. I trust that Dare will reciprocate in terms of protecting information about me.
You have asked me to ""work"" my notice period. Please explain what you mean by this. I have resigned from my position aggrieved with Dare. On one hand your last email infers that you are concerned about confidentiality given that I have resigned, but on the other hand you expect me to continue to trade the markets (or perform some other work in the office). More to the point, you are expecting me to attend work as though everything is very satisfactory and pleasant between us. I would also like to add that several brokers are already aware that I have resigned, which would make it extremely difficult for me to ""carry on"" as normal. The desk has operated effectively without me since I have resigned. Your comment about me being away from the desk hurting Dare financially is ridiculous.
In any case, your instructions about me returning to the office regard me more as chattel than as a person who has been badly let down by Dare.
You still do not recognise or wish to acknowledge the disappointment caused when my relocation to Dubai failed to materialise. While you can shrug off the Dubai situation as something that is no longer relevant, I (and my family) have been unable to forgive Dare for the way I was treated and let down”.
Mr Rahman responded to D2 on 26 February 2024 at 18:28:
“I'm a little taken aback by your emails. I appreciate that you were disappointed that the Dubai move didn't materialise. That was some time ago, back in early July 2023. You have worked as normal since then up until your resignation and indeed at the beginning of February 2024 you were happily discussing your future with Dare with me, and were keen to develop a new crude business line (I trust you remember our meeting of 1 February 2024 in this regard). So I don't really know where this is all coming from.
I thought it would be sensible to remind you of your contractual obligations, which you agreed to. I hope we can then move forward with you returning to your role given what I've previously said - we are losing a lot of money without you in seat”.
Mr Rahman then discussed the “Notice Period” and explained that D2 had not been put on Garden Leave. He continued:
“I have asked you to continue working your notice period. You are not on any form of authorised leave. As such, you are under a contractual obligation to continue attending the office and carrying out your duties as normal. In your case, this means being in the office five days per week and trading as usual on the Crude desk. It doesn't matter if brokers are aware that you have resigned - employees resign from their employment every day and this won't impact your ability to carry out your role. I am not asking you to do anything unusual here. This is an entirely standard and normal request.
I want to be clear about something, and I think it is important to be upfront. Your ongoing refusal to come to work and carry out your contractual obligations is a breach of contract. It is causing significant damage to Dare, and I understand from my lawyers that you are personally on the hook for that loss because it flows from your breach.
Your trading desk (Crude) brought in an average profit of [figure redacted] — you were the head of this desk and responsible for the majority of the profits. Dare is no longer able to bring in such a profit on the Crude desk. The desk is down circa. [particular amount] since you stopped working. As such, Dare are suffering actual losses as well as loss of profits - and even this is not the full extent of the loss, which will continue and will compound over time.
Obviously, I have no interest in holding you liable for this loss. What I want is to get you back to work so we are all profiting. I am therefore asking you again to come in, so that we can talk and so that you can carry on working. I would even consider compensating you through some form of bonus arrangement - (notwithstanding that you are not contractually entitled to a bonus) - which shows you how much we are losing / will lose without you”.
Mr Rahman asked D2 to meet him at the office the following day: 27 February 2024. He also discussed D2’s contractual obligations, saying that:
“Given the tone of your emails and the fact that you are currently absent without leave, I am very concerned about your compliance with the ongoing contractual obligations that you owe to Dare”.
Mr Rahman asked D2 to confirm that his employment would not end until 14 February 2025, that he understood that he had a 12-month non-compete period which runs from the end of his employment, and that he would not be able to start employment with a company that competes with Dare (in the United Kingdom, Dubai or anywhere else) until 14 February 2026. D2 was asked to confirm that he would comply with this restriction, along with other restrictive covenants. D2 was also asked if he had been offered or accepted a role with another company, and was told that he was contractually required to provide this confirmation. Mr Rahman also referred to Dare’s confidential information, and said that:
“my concern was that I did not want you to have any such information on your personal devices (which you should not have anyway). I have no issues with you accessing Dare's confidential information through your work devices and you will need to do this to carry out your role anyway.
Let's move forward constructively”.
D2 and Mr Beckwith discussed Mr Rahman’s response in a series of WhatsApp messages. D2 said that the response
“Looks pretty sinister this time... Talking about me being personally liable for losses they . . . Supposedly have accrued since I've been off. For your guide I left the book in good shape and think it's absurd the amount they are saying. Also I have no idea what trades they are putting on and have heard they are trading actively”.
Mr Beckwith commented: “That's so desperate their side. It is baseless. Pure intimidation which will only make their position so weak. Interestingly, would you know what the position is or book has done since you resigned? Obviously without asking anyone at Dare that is. From the brokers say?”. D2 replied: “One of my brokers told me they are trading actively”. He also said that “I saw in one of the last emails a dramatic change to my position. It showed the whole position.” Mr Beckwith asked “As in loss?”, to which D2 responded: “No the position. I think it was down around [redacted amount]  since I left. But that was last week And they have traded very actively so no idea how we could attribute that to me or their trades.” Mr Beckwith remarked: “This is desperate their side. And you can equally claim for the loss of income.. it is just a stupid argument their end.”
The conversation continued:
“D2: I think he's super deceitful and this email has made me very very upset. I had some very good positions on which I know would have done well as well. So no idea how they claim to have lost that much. In any case the book was up close to [redacted amount] for the new year when I left.
Mr Beckwith: It is hard mate, you see some people for what they really are. Horrible. I see this time and time again. Good people just shake hands and wish you the best. Dont take it personally. It is all just noise.
D2: I don't like the fact this guy is threatening me. It's disgraceful after how much I personally have made this guy over the years. I'm very shocked and dissapointed. Honestly I hope we can put him in his place at this stage and be done with this back and forth. In any case please let me know how you wish to proceed.
Mr Beckwith: The odd thing about it is that if he met you he wouldn't say anything of this. Well, he has taken the bait and what we needed ie to draw a line underneath it. He is being unreasonable and harassing you. Leave it with me. It is upsetting and will naturally make anyone feel super pissed off. But look beyond the strife and his anger. We will take care of it.
D2: Thanks. I assume I won't be going to meet this crazy guy tomorrow.
Mr Beckwith: Not if you're being threatened with losses.
D2: Thanks I will await to hear from you with regard to next steps. Hope this all counts to speed the ending of this crazy saga.
Mr Beckwith: Indeed. It is all a matter of him trying to intimidate.. Nasty man but weak. Money doesn't buy you brains. Plenty of rich idiots on this planet.
Will deal with Patrick”.
Patrick was a solicitor working for Reynolds Porter Chamberlain, the firm that Onyx had instructed.
On 27 February 2024, D2 had a conversation with Mr Beckwith in the morning that lasted more than 22 minutes. In the early evening, D2 received another email from Mr Rahman. He forwarded this to Mr Beckwith. Mr Beckwith said that Mr Rahman was “Pressuring you... you would have thought he had a business to run”. He said that Joanna (a solicitor at Fox Williams, the firm that D2 had instructed) and Patrick were “on the case. All this hassling you will be thrown back at him with a harassment case.” Mr Beckwith agreed that D2 should send the email to the solicitors. Mr Rahman’s email stated the following:
“You haven't responded to my email below and you didn't show up for the meeting today. You are still a senior employee of Dare and it is not acceptable for you to refuse to engage with me, or to attend a meeting with me. Please can you come into the office tomorrow so that we can discuss this? Please come in at 12:30p.m..
Please could you also respond to the questions set out in my email below? Your failure to respond to my email or attend a meeting with me is increasing my concern about the obligations you owe to Dare and we are continuing to suffer loss as a result of your refusal to come to work”.
The following day, 28 February 2024, at 11:00 am Mr Beckwith crafted a message for D2 to send back to Mr Rahman. This stated the following:
“I am unable to attend the meeting at 12:30 today that you would like me to attend.
The accusations you are making and the way you are addressing my resignation is causing me to feel extremely anxious and uncomfortable. Your emails carry the strong indication that a meeting with you would become confrontational and argumentative.
I have forwarded your emails to my legal advisor”.
This was described by Mr Beckwith to D2 as a “holding email ie so that you could not be criticised for not attending”. They spoke later that afternoon for over 41 minutes. After their call, D2 received another email from Mr Rahman and forwarded it to Mr Beckwith.
Later that day, at 02:50 pm, D2 sent a WhatsApp message to his father saying that:
“I’ve left my company and they are trying to make me feel very uncomfortable. It's stressing me out and I don't really want to be there at the moment. Need a couple weeks off. It's just grief. I can deal with it but it's horrible day to day for me and the family”.
D2’s father replied:
“Ok I m trying to get hold of him”.
D2’s father was a pharmacist. The person who D2’s father was trying to get hold of was his own General Practitioner, Dr Keane. In his evidence to the Court, D2 stated that he wanted to speak to a GP about how he was feeling; and that as he knew that the waiting times for his own General Practice were long, he asked his father to obtain an appointment for him with Dr Keane on an urgent basis.
At 15:48 on 28 February 2024, in response to D2’s email sent that morning, Mr Rahman wrote that:
“I am not sure where this is coming from.
You are still an employee of Dare and therefore I would expect you to be available during normal working hours, however, if 12:30pm today doesn't work for you, please could you let me know some times that would work for you either tomorrow or Friday? I will then work around your availability.
I have absolutely no intention for the meeting to be confrontational. I simply want to get back to work - and I don't understand why you are refusing to come to work. I am obviously concerned about: (i) the contractual obligations that you owe to Dare; and (ii) the ongoing and significant loss that Dare is suffering as a result of your refusal to come to work.
Please could you respond to the questions in my email below regarding your contractual obligations? These are straightforward and simple questions which should not be onerous to respond to”.
On 29 February 2024, D2 had a series of exchanges with Mr Beckwith via WhatsApp. Early in the morning, D2 stated that “My wife is concerned this may go on some permanent medical record and that it might impact the wellness test for Dubai visa. I don't suppose you would know if this could impact either of those?”. Mr Beckwith said he would check, but did not think that was a problem. A short time later, D2 told Mr Beckwith that he was going to see the doctor, and wanted to be clear that “I'm going to try and ask for around 2 to 3 weeks of leave and I assume I won't need to be going back there in the future”. Mr Beckwith responded:
“Just need to lay on that you are not an anxious person but you are going through a very hostile situation with your employer who is threatening you with insane and fabricated financial losses”.
An hour later, D2 sent the sick note to Mr Beckwith and told him that he was signed off until 18 March 2024, to which Mr Beckwith responded “Nice”. Mr Beckwith also explained that this would not affect the Dubai situation, and that a fit note from a GP did not constitute “a diagnosis”. D2 submitted his fit note to Dare via an “app” on his phone.  The note, signed by Dr Keane, stated that D2’s case had been assessed on 29 February 2024; that D2 was not fit for work because of “Stress at work”; and that this would be the case until 18 March 2024.
Also on 29 February 2024, Fox Williams wrote to Dare as follows:
“We are instructed to act for our client, Ashley Hikmet. We have seen the email correspondence that Mr Ayman Rahman has recently exchanged with our client in relation to and following his resignation from his employment with Dare International Limited (“Dare”).
Our client is currently not well enough to attend work, due to the stress and anxiety caused by both events during his employment with Dare and concerns about his position following his resignation. He has seen a doctor and has been signed off work until 18 March 2024 due to stress at work. We enclose his fit note.
It is important that Dare understands the severe detrimental impact that events during our client’s employment have had on him, which has ultimately led to his resignation and to the stress and anxiety caused by the fact of his resignation.
As stated in our client’s resignation email, our client remains deeply disappointed and affected by the manner in which Dare handled the proposed relocation to Dubai last year. The proposed relocation was an extremely important and major event in our client’s life, affecting his family too. Dare’s actions both in seeking to require our client to sign a wholly unreasonable contract in respect of the move, and pulling out of the move at short notice, deeply undermined the trust and confidence that our client had in Dare as his employer. The fact that three out of the seven senior traders who were due to move to Dubai have now resigned shows that our client’s feelings were shared by his colleagues who have now resigned. Dare’s failure to adequately recognise the impact on our client resulting from these events has only served to undermine his trust and confidence in Dare further and ultimately led to the conclusion that he could no longer remain in Dare’s employment. He did not take this step lightly - his observations about how departing colleagues were treated meant he felt fearful of raising his concerns in the aftermath of the Dubai situation and fearful of the reaction when he gave notice.
Our client’s fears are well-founded, given the way in which he has observed Mr Rahman treat other staff (including those who have recently resigned) in the past. For example, when one of our client’s colleagues resigned around two months prior to our client’s resignation, Mr Rahman called senior members of staff into a meeting to express that he intended to create an alternative role for the colleague to keep him working for Dare as long as possible. Our client found this to be both vindictive and verging on threatening behaviour from Mr Rahman, essentially warning other senior staff not to leave Dare otherwise they would face the same treatment.
Since our client’s resignation on 14 February 2024, he has become very anxious and fearful of attending the office and continuing with his job. Whilst the written correspondence between the two appears measured and reasonable, the reality is that Mr Rahman is known to be extremely challenging towards anyone who resigns, as referred to above. Our client’s role as Head of Crude Oil Trader is by its very nature a high-risk function which entails taking volatile positions on a daily basis. Our client does not feel comfortable undertaking such high-risk decisions when he does not have trust and confidence that he has Dare’s and Mr Rahman’s full backing and support. He has witnessed Mr Rahman’s outbursts to senior traders who aren’t performing or in some way cross him. They are humiliating, create a culture of fear and they undermine and damage reputations. Given the high-risk function our client undertakes, he does not feel comfortable continuing to perform his role in this hostile and unpredictable environment.
The incessant correspondence our client has recently received from Mr Rahman by both email and WhatsApp, including to his personal phone, has increased our client’s anxiety. As have the threats of legal action. Our client is fearful that if he returns to work, he will find himself in a confrontational situation with Mr Rahman. At this time, that would be very detrimental to his health. Our client received a further email from Mr Rahman yesterday afternoon referencing the “ongoing and significant loss” that Dare is suffering because of his absence. Our client considers that this allegation is entirely unfounded; our client left his trading positions in a good state and Dare is clearly able to continue trading without our client. Therefore, no such financial losses can be attributed to his absence.
In light of the above, our client needs time off work to focus on recovering his health. When he is able to do so, he should be in a position to engage with the handover of his role as outlined by Mr Rahman. We will keep you updated in this regard but in the meantime, please ensure that you correspond with us going forward in relation to this matter and refrain from contacting our client directly whilst he is not well enough to work”.
On 1 March 2024, D2 messaged Mr Beckwith in the morning, saying that a few brokers were reaching out for private lunch or dinners, and he wondered if he could do that if it was for “social reasons”. Mr Beckwith replied that:
“It is a bit risky given your letter that went from Joanna [a solicitor instructed by D2 at Fox Williams] to Dare and plus the sick note.
I am more relaxed when it is a case of meeting up over the weekend as close friends on a social basis, but meeting up during the week formally is probably best to avoid (especially if the brokers start gossiping that they met up with you).
But there will be a time to meet them soon, just got to be careful with it now. So, meet brokers who you would regard as your really good mates out of work, and the others you can meet when the dust settles a bit”.
In further messages, D2 asked what Mr Beckwith was “expecting next from Dare? Seems like they are just gonna keep spinning the same counter into eternity”. Mr Beckwith replied: “Expect them to have their lawyers write a response. This will get into spat between the lawyers. All normal and to be expected. But ultimately then reaches a point very where the relationship is agreed by both as untenable. But the lawyers know that from the start - it is all posturing.. It looks like nothing is happening but in reality big strides are made and then boom - it is all over.” D2 responded: “Got it. Will we at any point look to raise damages against them? Or more like in the back pocket In case they do something first? Sounds like I will potentially be out for less time than Stephen in that case? Or too early to say”. Mr Beckwith’s response was “My goal is always to see if we can get you a pay off from Dare because you are identifying so many injustices and problems.. but i don't want to unduly promise as these things are often quite fiery in the beginning. We just need to play it like chess”.
Later that day, D2 asked Mr Beckwith if he had seen the response from Dare’s lawyers. This was a reference to a four page letter from Dare’s solicitors. The letter stated that it was responding to the Fox Williams’ letter of 29 February 2024. The solicitors say that “Our client is sorry to hear that [D2] has been signed off work”; they refer to D2’s remuneration package and say that “The size of that figure is reflective of the value of your client to Dare’s business”. Issue was taken with assertions made by Fox Williams, but it was stressed that Dare “wishes to be constructive. Your client remains an employee of our client, he is highly valued and highly regarded, and the business wishes to make it as easy as possible for him to return to work. Tendentious correspondence is likely only to inflame matters where the parties (and their legal representatives) should be looking to calm them.” Dare’s solicitors rejected that there was any basis of a claim that Mr Rahman has behaved improperly towards D2. I note, in this regard, that D2 did not treat Mr Rahman’s behaviour towards him as justifying his immediate resignation. Nor has any claim, or counter-claim, for “harassment” been brought by D2 against Dare.
The letter continued:
“As regards matters since your client's resignation, your position is hard to understand. A reasonable person reviewing the correspondence between the parties would inevitably conclude that (i) our client has been patient and courteous to your client at all times, (ii) far from being ""incessant"", the correspondence from our client has been notably measured and restrained, (iii) your client has no possible basis for asserting that he is ""anxious and fearful"" of attending the office, in circumstances where Mr Rahman has been consistent and clear that he values Mr Hikmet and wants him to return to work. Indeed, on 26 February 2024 our client mooted the notion of an ad hoc bonus arrangement to that end — something which is not mentioned in your letter, but which plainly shows how valued your client is”.
The letter went on to say that Dare
“is suffering loss as a result of your client being absent. Your client surely understands this. He is the head of the Crude trading desk in a fast-moving market. As at Monday 26 February 2024, it is estimated that his desk was down [particular amount]  as a result of his absence. Of course, our client was perfectly entitled to mention such losses in circumstances where your client has never previously (before yesterday) indicated that he was not well enough to work. It is worth reiterating that your client has Mr Rahman's trust and confidence. He has his backing and support. He is an excellent performer in his role as Head of Crude Oil Trader and his work is valued and respected. Our client hopes that, when he is fit to do so, he attends work and carry out his duties. That is no more than his duties require. There is nothing unreasonable in it”.
The letter requested that D2 confirm that his employment will not end until 14 February 2025; that D2 is subject to the non-compete period until 14 February 2026; that D2 understands the other post-termination restraints and will comply with them; and asked D2 to confirm if he had been offered or accepted a role with another company.  The letter also requested D2 to attend an Occupational Health referral on the basis that “the medical note provided with your letter does not disclose enough information to plan for your client's swift and successful re-integration into the business once he is fit to work”. The letter also referred to the resignation of three of the Senior Traders: “Naturally our client is concerned about the timing and nature of these resignations”.
In a message to D2, Mr Beckwith described the solicitor’s letter as “More of the same garbage just sent by lawyers. It's funny it talks about suspicion of timing of 3 departures. Nothing suspicious we were all upset about Dubai”. Mr Beckwith’s response was: “Honestly mate, pathetic.” D2 responded: “Agreed. Looking forward to next step”.
There was further correspondence between the parties’ solicitors. On 15 March 2024, Dare’s solicitors noted that D2’s sick note was expiring on 18 March 2024. They stated if D2 did not return to work and provide a further sick note, Dare would wish to proceed with an immediate Occupational Health referral, contending that it was not for D2 to decide whether that was “necessary” or not. D2 asked Mr Beckwith later that day whether he had seen “the latest crazy email from their lawyers? Curious to hear your thoughts given this medical note coming to an end etc.” Mr Beckwith read the email and described it to D2 as “Pathetic”. Later in the communications, D2 said “They love to make threats”.
On 18 March 2024, Dr Keane signed a further fit note for D2. This stated that he had assessed D2’s case on that date, and advised that D2 was not fit for work until 25 March 2024 due to “Stress at work with related insomnia”. D2 told the Court that he did not meet with Dr Keane for this assessment, and had only met Dr Keane for the first fit note. The information about D2’s condition had been conveyed to Dr Keane by D2’s father. On 22 April 2024, Dr Keane produced a further fit note for the period until 20 May 2024. This stated that D2 was not fit for work due to “Stress at work with related insomnia”. A further fit note was issued by Dr Keane on 21 May 2024, saying that D2 would be unfit for work until 1 July 2024 due to “Stress at work”. The final fit note for D2 was issued on 2 July 2024, this covered the period until 5 August 2024, based on “Stress at work”.
During the period following his resignation, D2 had a number of meetings with personnel from Onyx. On 14 March 2024, D2 had a WhatsApp exchange with Mr Kayaam. Mr Kayaam asked about meeting up for lunch or dinner, and D2 said to him that: “A bit more settled now that the chatter between me and Ayman has taken a breather. Taken up some golf lessons as well!”. D2 then said:
“Not sure how much forward planning if any you want me to be involved in but could be quite constructive to have a few meetings in advance of landing if that's possible. Good for pricing sheet set up etc. otherwise looking forward to a general catch up . . . ”.
Mr Kayaam replied to say that they would do that in around June or July, to which D2 said:
“Great keen to hit the ground running when the timing is right”.
On 15 March 2024, Mr Beckwith asked D2 if he could meet up with him the following week: “Need you to meet henry and nathan plus others . . . Got a lot going on progress wise with Dubai”. That was a reference to Henry Monahan (Onyx’s Director of Trading Operations) and Nathan Tynan (Onyx’s Director of Compliance). D2 met up with them on 20 March 2024.
Following their meeting, D2 messaged Mr Beckwith to say:
“Thanks for arranging today. Was really productive to get that initial band-aid ripped off re comparing differences. There is a decent amount of work to be done but will roll the sleeves up and work hard over the next few months to get this ironed out within the framework of what we can do etc. speak soon”.
Mr Beckwith responded:
“Glad you could make it today. Now that you have met Henry and Nathan today, we can have you chatting with them to get everything ready for you.
If you can get out to see the Dubai office, that would be great”.
D2 also messaged Mr Kayaam after the meeting to say:
“Really great to catch up with the team. Think there is some work to be done over the next few months, but seems like the team have a good energy to cooperate and get this over the line. Looking forward to a golf round at some point (with a lot more practicing on my side prior!)”.
On 25 March 2024, Mr Beckwith asked D2 if he could pass his number to Mr Monahan, who wanted to call him and introduce D2 to the Onyx employee who runs “Eagle”: the trading software used by Onyx. D2 replied that “Sounds great I have some work I would like to do on Eagle so that would be really helpful”. On 26 March 2024, D2 had a call lasting more than17 minutes with Mr Kayaam. They had a further call for nearly 14 minutes on 18 April 2024. On 21 April 2024, in a WhatsApp exchange, D2 discussed office buildings in Dubai, telling Mr Kayaam that he had “Found out GFI are in a building called the Al fattan currency house said it's pretty decent and not the most expensive. If you had a budget in mind I would be happy to help the team”.
The previous week, D2 had visited the office that Onyx had rented in Dubai. On 15 April 2024, D2 messaged Mr Beckwith to say “Seems capable for 2 people but probably will run out of room pretty quickly if more than 2 with desk setups. Managed to see a few mates out here and got a good feel for the place”.
D2 met with Mr Beckwith, Mr Tynan and George Lucas (Onyx’s head of Legal) again on 5 July 2024. Following their meeting, in a WhatsApp exchange, Mr Beckwith said that “Nathan and George were pumped after their meeting with you.. lots going on and all about pushing forward now”.
On 8 May 2024, D2 met Mr Law at the Oka restaurant. Before this meeting, they had corresponded on a number of occasions. On 24 February 2024, Mr Law messaged D2 to say: “Hey mate, heard you left as well?! Hope all good with you!”. D2 replied: “Hey man sorry not had a chance to message you. Can't really say much cause of all the legal. Just to say I have resigned and my family are moving to Dubai probably this year maybe beginning of next”. I have no doubt that this was a genuine response from D2: that he had not communicated with Mr Law previously about his resignation. D2 did not expect that his WhatsApp messages would be the subject of scrutiny by a Court, and had no reason to plant evidence for a future case or distort the truth. During the course of the message exchange, Mr Law said to D2 that “I'm also hoping to move to Dubai btw”, to which D2 responded “Feels like everyone is headed there if not already there”. Mr Law asked to meet up, and D2 responded: “Would be great let me figure out what and when I can do stuff. Appreciate should be fine as it would be non work related. Just have to run everything by legal team these days”.
On 6 March 2024, D2 had a 32 minute call with Mr Law. During that call, they clearly discussed the circumstances following Mr Law’s resignation as in a WhatsApp exchange with Mr Beckwith on 15 March 2024, D2 said “Tom called me the other day. Said they tried this occupational thing on him said it was probably Ayman's mate”.
The conversation between D2 and Mr Law at the Oka restaurant was secretly recorded by a private investigator working on behalf of Dare. During the course of their conversation, Mr Law told D2 that he had spoken to Mr Kayaam at Onyx, but had told him “Don’t talk to me until June”. D2 already knew this, as he said that “He mentioned that he spoke to you”. D2 asked if they had had a good conversation and Mr Law said that “it was decent”. D2 described Onyx as being “very ambitious, the good thing about them is that they're just business, they don't really get emotional . . . they're really going for it, like as in they're really going for it. I think they're going to take on like quite a few people”. Mr Law responded with: “I mean this, this, is their chance, Ayman's just handed them the fucking win, hasn't he?”, to which D2 replied “Yeah, he's shot himself in the foot”. With respect to Onyx, D2 said “you go there, it's not like you're starting from scratch and building the technology all over again, like you can literally trade like from day one with the resources”. D2 told Mr Law that “the actual structure” of Onyx’s Dubai office “is still being settled at the moment but . . . they’re really fucking incentivising”. Mr Law said that everyone knew that D2 was going to Onyx. He added “Some people think I’m going to Onyx as well”.
They talked about what was going on with Mr Rahman. Both said that they had not heard from him for 4 weeks or so. D2 said that he had heard that ten people had left. Mr Law asked D2 if he had spoken to D1. D2 said “I don’t want to, obviously he’s moving there . . . I’ve literally not spoken to him since he’s resigned. When he resigned, I actually thought he was ill, you know they make out like something’s happened… I wanted to message him to say but I didn’t, so I’ve literally not messaged, called, nothing”. Mr Law replied with: “It’s better, they can’t accuse you of anything”, to which D2 said “Yeah exactly. It’s literally the truth. But in my last email Ayman said, he was like, the timing is suspicious that you guys have all left, basically trying to insinuate we left together.” Mr Law responded by saying “I'd reply to him yeah, that's because you, everyone's finally had enough of you being [inaudible]”. D2 replied: “We all left for the same reason. You fucked up Dubai mate”.
They talked about other people who worked at Dare. Mr Law said that “the next ones on the list is probably like Rupesh or Vinni to be honest”, to which D2 said “They don’t want to go Dubai”. D2 also referred to “Amrit and Cam”, saying that “I think they’re quite vulnerable because I mean they’re not earning [redacted] right? So, if someone’s offering them a better [redacted] ,  sign on and Cameron was keen to go to Dubai as well”. Mr Law responded: “It’s so hard to get them away, because I spoke to Cam, and he’s like what’s the point? I’m finally earning good money, if I leave here then I’m sure Ayman is going to sit back down on fuel.”
Later in the conversation, D2 said to Mr Law: “You know, Omar's, like, said, asked me if any of these juniors are good, [pay well] so [inaudible] have a strong view [inaudible] said to be honest [inaudible] a lot of them are like freeloaders [inaudible] one or two years [inaudible]”. In cross-examination, D2 was asked about this:
“Q. ""... Omar's ... asked me if any of these juniors are good ..."" That is correct, is it?
A. Yes, he would have asked that, yes.
Q. And you then gave him your view on the juniors at Dare, correct?
I believe I said some −− I basically gave some negative feedback, yes.”
They also talked about the losses that Mr Rahman had claimed D2 had caused Dare. D2 said that Mr Rahman was “trying to intimidate”. D2 said to Mr Law: “what did it for me actually, what really pushed me over the edge was when Stephen resigned, and he was like, he took us to a side and basically said ""I'm going to fuck ..trying to [inaudible] him [inaudible] for 2 years"". Like that was the final straw for me, this guy is literally just...”
D2 asked Mr Law whether Mr Kayaam had asked him about “strategy and stuff”. Mr Law’s response was:
“[inaudible] to be honest I was actually like [inaudible]”.
D2 responded:
“[inaudible] help you out a little bit because basically he [inaudible] MOC stuff. So like I think [inaudible] MOC stuff because they don’t like [inaudible] MOC [inaudible] I don’t know if that [inaudible] usually do [inaudible]”.
MOC was a reference to “Market on Close” trading: that is, buying or selling a security at the closing price of the trading day. Mr Law responded:
“Yeah it's good to know, I appreciate that. The last thing you want is to go somewhere start doing it and have a problem. It's almost not worth it [inaudible]”.
D2 then said:
“And they must have got scared when they saw what happened to Dare, with the US regulations stuff”,
to which Mr Law said:
“He's probably thinking it's not worth it, he's probably right”.
They then discussed a meeting before a dinner at the restaurant Sushi Samba, which had taken place on 26 September 2023. D2 said that Mr Rahman “was like ""if I wanted to, you guys are basically useless to me, I could do fuel cover""”. Mr Law said do you know who was most “pissed off about that?”, to which D2 said “Stephen?”, and Mr Law said: “No, Cam, because he goes, just before that, he goes ""so Cam and Amrit have made [redacted] , so one could assume that me and Jono would make at least that”. D2 said to that: “Yeah that was... uncalled for”.  I find that this characterisation of the meeting on 26 September 2023 was broadly correct. Neither Mr Law, nor D2, thought that their conversation was being recorded and they had no reason to mischaracterise what had taken place.
Mr Law asked D2 what sort of percentage had Mr Kayaam offered, to which D2 said “Total % is 40 basically . . . it’s between taking 40 or 30 and like up to 10, but it’s not really clear if it’ll actually be 10 in reality”. Mr Law asked if that was “10 of the office”, and D2 said: “Yeah but I'm not sure that is actually how it'll play out, it'll be less, quite a bit less, put it that way. The good thing is, he sounds, like, pretty flexible as in like. . . the whole thing is I would say is he's the kind of guy who basically really cares like to make you happy, when you want somebody, you're like, but again, don't mention this to anyone”. Mr Law agreed that he would not mention it to anyone, and said “I don’t know who I’d tell anyway”. D2 replied: “No, but if you came to negotiate with Omar and you're like ""well I think I should get this""”, and Mr Law replied: “Nah, that's a good way to start off on the wrong foot”.
They then talked about different personnel at Onyx.
“D2: But I haven't really spoken much to Greg at all, like Greg I think he is very busy.
Mr Law: I don't think he knows much, he didn't even show up when I went to meet Omar and HR.
D2: Oh okay. John? He's a nice guy.
Mr Law: Yeah, he is a nice guy. I liked them, they seemed like fairly straightforward chaps”.
D2 said that Mr Beckwith was “really solid, he helped me a lot when I was leaving . . . Basically equivalent of Consigliere of the company . . . He’ll do anything to get stuff over the line you know”. Mr Law said that when he had spoken to Mr Beckwith, he had said that D2 would be starting in September. D2 said “I think he’s probably more aggressive than Omar”, to which Mr Law said “He said to me 6 months, and I was like “I wish””.
Mr Law and D2 then discussed claims for damages and injunction to stop them working. Mr Law said he was happy with one year, to which D2 said “I’d be happy to do like 6-8 months . .. If I get it over and done with quicker, then [inaudible] I can start with the rest of my life”.  There was no discussion about sickness, or that D2 was feeling stressed.
A month later, following receipt of a pre-action letter from Dare’s solicitors, D2’s solicitors responded on 11 June 2024, stating that:
“[O]ur client has been signed off work until 1 July 2024 due to the stress and anxiety cause by events during his employment with Dare and concerns about his position following his resignation, exacerbated by the threats of legal action by your client. His previous sick leave at Dare therefore has no relevance to his current absence.
With respect to your request for our client attend an Occupation Health referral, our client is willing to attend an appointment. To be clear, you first requested that our client attend Occupational Health in your letter of 1 March 2024 and repeated this request on 15 March 2024, at which stage our client had only been signed off for 2 and 4 weeks respectively. Such requests were plainly premature. We noted, in our letter dated 2 April 2024, that your request (at that stage) appeared to be another intimidation tactic as we would be very surprised if your client customarily referred individuals to Occupational Health after such a short period of time. We received no response from you on this until your letter (sent six weeks later on 14 May 2024). As our client now has been signed off work for further period of time the position is clearly different, and our client is willing to attend an Occupational Health appointment”.
Mr Rahman did not take D2 up on this offer. He told the Court that it was “too late”.
Also during the notice period, D2 had a number of holidays, even though he was officially on sick leave. From 29 March 2024 to 6 April 2024, D2 went on a skiing holiday to Whistler, in Canada, which he described to a friend as “amazing”. Between 10 and 16 April 2024, D2 visited Dubai with his family. In a WhatsApp exchange with Mr Law on 11 April 2024, D2 said it was “amazing. Good buzz here.” In a WhatsApp message with Luke Oldershaw on 12 April 2024, he said “this place is insane”. In a WhatsApp message to Joshua Conners (a broker) on 13 April 2024, D2 wrote that “It's amazing here in Dubai mate. Different life. Trust me you will never look back. I think I will stay here a long time.” Whilst in Dubai, D2 met up with Jeremy  Abihssira.
On 19 June 2024, in a WhatsApp exchange with someone called Seyd Anane, D2 was asked about how he was enjoying his garden leave. He said: “It's been good but also can't help feeling guilt of not working lol it's very wierd. I also have so much fomo away from the market. Crazy how long these non competes are these days.”
During his notice period, D2 met with a number of brokers. In the course of his oral evidence, D2 explained that he had close relationships with a number of brokers that had been built up over the years. Some of them were social friends of his. He and his wife were friendly socially with one of the brokers, Mr Abihssira, and his wife. On 15 February 2024, D2 informed Mr Abihssira that he had resigned. He also informed traders, including Joshua Conners and Marco Courtney, of his resignation that same day. He had a call with Mr Conners shortly after informing him of his resignation, and exchanged further messages (some of which involved details about trades that had taken place in the Crude market) and had further calls with him throughout the notice period. On 16 February 2024, D2 had an audio call lasting more than 11 minutes with Mr Abihssira. Following that call, Mr Abihssira messaged to say: “Mate really happy for you! You made the right choice!”. D2 replied with “Very excited”. There is no doubt that D2 informed Mr Abihssira of the identity of his new employer. On 20 February 2024, Mr Abihssira messaged D2 to ask if would be in London the following week. He confirmed that he would be and that they could probably meet up, if just the two of them. D2 commented: “Look forward to it if you're coming!”. Mr Abihssira was based in Dubai.
On 15 February 2024, D2 contacted Luke Oldershaw (a broker) to tell him that he had resigned. Mr Oldershaw had recently resigned from his employment. D2 said that “Crazy we all gonna be off at the same time lol”. Mr Oldershaw asked how long D2’s “gardening leave” would be. D2 said “Decent chunk of time… All down to legal now”. They met up in Dubai when D2 was visiting there with his family in April. On 4 June 2024, Mr Oldershaw asked D2 how “non work life” was, and D2 replied “Hey mate all good… Just came back from espana”. Mr Oldershaw was in Bali at the time of these messages and D2 asked him how it was. He sent D2 a picture of a helicopter ride that he had taken that day with his cab driver. D2 said “Save some money mate”. Mr Oldershaw replied: “Nah it grows on trees don’t you know”, to which D2 said “Literally this is like gap year on steroids cause we all have money. I think I’m gonna be bankrupt by the time I actually start work”. Mr Oldershaw said “might as well make most of it”, to which D2 said “I know”. The reference to the “gap year on steroids” was to Mr Oldershaw’s time off, and not D2’s.
On 16 February 2024, D2 reached out to a counterparty with whom D2 had done business to inform him of his resignation. D2 told him that it had been pleasure “to do some work with you and hopefully will be able to reach out again in due course to catch up. Got a long notice period ahead”. D2 messaged that “Very wierd feeling to be out with no positions to think about”, followed by a laughing emoji.
On 21 February 2024, D2 messaged Mr Beckwith to say that: “Have a few traders who are looking to meet up with me discreetly flying in next week. Is it ok if it's very discreet?” Mr Beckwith responded: “I wouldn't have an issue, just need to be happy they are good guys who wont gossip if you follow me”. D2 responded that “Think it would be good to set things up for sure. Will do so discreetly”. In his oral evidence, D2 suggested that the reference to “traders” was an error, he meant to say “brokers” and that he was referring to brokers flying in to London to attend a conference. I do not accept this explanation. D2 clearly knew the difference between brokers and traders, and there was no reason why “traders” (that is, counterparties) would not attend the conference. D2 told the Court that he had met up with a number of broker friends after resigning: Carlo Peccioli, Marco Courtney, Jeremy Abihssira, Luke Oldershaw, Anthony Georgiou, Will Brentnall, Marlon Lindsey, Jeremy Chamberlain and Joshua Conners.
Termination of employment
On 11 July 2024, Dare terminated the Defendants’ employment. They were paid their basic salary in lieu of the unexpired period of notice. On the same day, proceedings were issued against the Defendants and urgent injunctive relief was sought. As already explained, on 18 July 2024, Anthony Metzer KC accepted undertakings from the Defendants and gave directions to a speedy trial.
Following D1’s resignation, around 15 other members of staff have also resigned, many of whom have also claimed to be too sick to work during their notice period.
Legal Principles: (i) The Post-Termination restraints
There was no real dispute between the parties with respect to the key applicable legal principles for enforcing post-termination restraints. Those principles are as follows:
the Court must decide what each restriction means when properly construed: (a) if a clause is valid in all ordinary circumstances which can have been contemplated by the parties, it is equally valid, notwithstanding that it might cover circumstances which are so “extravagant”, “fantastical”, “unlikely or improbable” that they must have been entirely outside the contemplation of the parties; and
the validity principle means that parties to a contract will have intended it to be valid. If there are two alternative realistic constructions, the parties are deemed to have meant to enter into a valid agreement, not an invalid one. The validity principle is only engaged where the covenant is genuinely ambiguous and where the rival constructions are both realistic. It does not apply where the Court reaches the conclusion that one construction is clearly preferable to the other: see Tillman v Egon Zehnder Ltd [2020] AC 154 at [42].
the Court must then consider whether Dare has shown on the evidence that it has legitimate business interests in relation to the employees’ employment;
Generally, employers have legitimate interests in protecting (a) confidential information and know-how, (b) trade connections, and (c) a stable, trained workforce in a highly competitive business.
In relation to confidential information, the employer needs to establish that at the time the contract was entered into the nature of the proposed employment was such as would expose the employee to information of the kind capable of protection beyond the term of the contract: see Thomas v Farr Plc [2007] ICR 932 at [41].
An employee who has obtained confidential information of value to the employer, or who has built up his knowledge by taking advantage of knowledge, such as working techniques or practices, which is not generally known or available, can be restrained after the employment has ended from exploiting the information or knowledge to his own advantage and to the detriment of the employer: Credico Marketing Ltd v Lambert [2022] EWCA Civ 864 at [38]. This includes when an employee cannot remember the minute details of a process but “would [be] likely to remember in general terms what the problem was and what was the solution, what experiments were made and whether the results were positive or negative and so on” and where the employee would be likely, when the need arose, “to dredge up from the recesses of his memory” the particular secret which, while he was employed, he had found appropriate to deal with the requirement: Commercial Plastics Ltd v Vincent [1965] 1 QB 623 at 642F-G.
Information which can be protected includes that which is used in a trade or business and which, if disclosed to a competitor, would be liable to cause “real (or significant) harm” to the employer: Lansing Linde Ltd v Kerr [1991] 1 WLR. 251 at [260].
Protection cannot be legitimately claimed in respect of the skill, experience, know-how and general knowledge acquired through performing the contract (even though it may assist a competitor).
once the existence of legitimate protectable interests has been established, the Court must be satisfied that each restriction is no wider than reasonably necessary for the protection of those interests.
Reasonable necessity is to be assessed from the perspective of reasonable persons in the position of the parties as at the date of the contract, having regard to the contractual provisions as a whole and the factual matrix to which it was expected to apply. The Court can take into account what the parties (objectively) intended or contemplated at the time: that may include the intention or contemplation that the employee might be promoted, or attain further qualification and experience. Subsequent events may be taken into account insofar as they shed light on what was in the parties’ reasonable contemplation at the time of the contract: (See e.g. QBE Management Services Ltd v Dymoke [2012] IRLR 458 at [210]; and TFS v Morgan [2005] IRLR 246 at [36]-[38]).
Non-compete covenants may be the most appropriate, or even the only, way to protect legitimate business interests in certain circumstances. Other less restrictive covenants may be inadequate to protect those interests, or may be difficult to police.
In Littlewoods Organisation Ltd. v Harris [1977] 1 WLR 1472 Lord Denning MR stated at 1479A–E that:
“It is thus established that an employer can stipulate for protection against having his confidential information passed on to a rival in trade. But experience has shown that it is not satisfactory to have simply a covenant against disclosing confidential information. The reason is because it is so difficult to draw the line between information which is confidential and information which is not: and it is very difficult to prove a breach when the information is of such a character that a servant can carry it away in his head. The difficulties are such that the only practicable solution is to take a covenant from the servant by which he is not to go to work for a rival in trade”.
Non-poaching of employee covenants have been held to be objectionable as a matter of principle on the basis that such a restraint interferes with the job mobility of third parties to the contract: see Monster Vision (UK) Ltd v McKie [2011] EWHC 3772 (QB) at [11], [39] and [62]; see also White Digital Media Ltd v Weaver [2013] EWHC 1681 (QB) at [31]-[35] and [42].
The duration of any post-termination restraint will, to some extent, be arbitrary: see, e.g. Beckett Investment Management Group Ltd v Hall [2007] ICR 1539 at [29].
The Court will only deem a post-termination restraint to be excessively long if a “much less far-reaching” restraint would have afforded adequate protection. The exercise is not a marginal one, “otherwise Courts would be faced with a paralysing debate in every case about whether a covenant with x days shaved off would still provide adequate protection”: see QBE Management Services Ltd at [215]; and Stenhouse (Australia) Ltd v Phillips [1974] AC 391 at 402.
Where part of a covenant is unreasonable, the Court may sever the unreasonable part and enforce the remainder, provided that no words need to be added or modified, and that the removal of the unreasonable part does not generate any major change in the overall effect of the post-termination restraints: see Egon Zehnder at [84]-[86].
Even if the covenant is held to be reasonable, the Court will then finally decide whether, as a matter of discretion, the injunctive relief sought should in all the circumstances be granted.
It does not follow that simply because a covenant is held to be enforceable, the inevitable remedy is a final injunction. Injunctions are discretionary remedies: see D v P [2016] ICR 688 at [70]-[75].
when a post-termination restraint is enforceable, the starting point is that the ordinary remedy is an injunction: Dyson Technology Ltd v Pellerey [2016] ICR 355 at [21].
In Insurance Co v Lloyd’s Syndicate [1995] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 272, at 276-7, Colman J referred to “exceptional cases where the granting of an injunction would be so prejudicial to a defendant and cause him such hardship that it would be unconscionable for the plaintiff to be given injunctive relief if he could not prove damage”. In Pellerey, Sir Colin Rimer stated at [21] that the categories of circumstances in which injunctive relief would not follow were “never closed”. In Sunrise Brokers LLP v Rodgers [2015] ICR 272 it was held at [49] that even if the covenant was valid, the Court is entitled to refuse relief on the basis that subsequent events have made it unreasonable to enforce it.
Legal Principles: (ii) Springboard injunctions
The springboard doctrine originated in cases concerning misuse of confidential information: see Terrapin Ltd v Builders’ Supply Co (Hayes) Ltd [1960] RPC 128 at 130. The doctrine has subsequently been found to apply to a variety of unlawful conduct by a departing employee: see eg. UBS Wealth Management (UK) Ltd v Vestra Wealth LLP [2008] IRLR 965, where Openshaw J observed at [4] that:
“In my judgment, springboard relief is not confined to cases where former employees threaten to abuse confidential information acquired during the currency of their employment. It is available to prevent any future or further serious economic loss to a previous employer caused by former staff members taking an unfair advantage, an 'unfair start', of any serious breaches of their contract of employment (or if they are acting in concert with others, of any breach by any of those others). That unfair advantage must still exist at the time that the injunction is sought, and it must be shown that it would continue unless restrained. I accept that injunctions are to protect against and to prevent future and further losses and must not be used merely to punish past breaches of contract”.
The relevant legal principles were set out by Haddon-Cave J in QBE Management Services Ltd at [239]–[247] (as approved by the Court of Appeal in Forse v Secarma Ltd [2019] IRLR 587 at [22] and [35]). They are in summary:
Where a person has obtained a ‘head start’ as a result of unlawful acts, the Court can grant an injunction which restrains the wrongdoer, so as to deprive him of the fruits of his unlawful acts.
The purpose of a springboard order is to prevent the defendants from taking unfair advantage of the springboard which they have unlawfully obtained.
Springboard relief can be granted in relation to breaches of contractual and fiduciary duties, and flows from a wider principle that the court may grant an injunction to deprive a wrongdoer of the unlawful advantage derived from his wrongdoing.
Springboard relief must be sought and obtained at a time when any unlawful advantage is still being enjoyed by the wrongdoer. It should have the aim of restoring the parties to the competitive position they each set out to occupy, and would have occupied, but for the defendant's misconduct.
What is fair and just in any particular circumstances will be measured by (i) the effect of the unlawful acts upon the claimant; and (ii) the extent to which the defendant has gained an illegitimate competitive advantage.
The burden is on the claimant to spell out the precise nature and period of the competitive advantage”.
In QBE Management Services Ltd, Haddon-Cave J stated at [284] that in determining the length of the springboard:
“The court must assess the actual advantage gained by wrongdoers as a result of their unlawful activities and grant appropriate relief. Springboard injunctive relief is for unlawfully ‘stealing a march’ on competitors. The essential question is therefore: how much of a march have the defendants in this case, in fact, stolen on the claimant as a result of their wrongdoing? This depends on both the length and tensile strength of the ‘springboard’ itself and gauging the relative advantage gained by its use”.
At [285], Haddon-Cave set out a number of principles to apply:
First, the appropriate measure for the length of a springboard injunction is the length of time that it would have taken the wrongdoer to achieve lawfully what he in fact achieved unlawfully, relative to the victim.
Second, it must be emphasised that the exercise is a relative one and any advantage must be measured as such. Wrongful activities may have both a positive and negative effect, i.e. benefiting the wrongdoer whilst simultaneously harming the victim. Thus, for instance, the unlawful poaching of key staff is likely to advantage the wrongdoing party whilst disadvantaging the victim who has lost key staff and may have to recover lost market ground.
Third, it is relevant to look at the period of time over which the unlawful activities have in fact taken place. The relationship of this period with the length of any springboard relief is, however, kinetic not linear.
Fourth, there may be many different factors at play during the period of unlawful activity materially affecting the advantage gained which may, or may not, obtain in similar assumed circumstances of purely lawful activity. These factors might include, for instance, (i) the advantage of soliciting junior employees whilst still being employed and in positions of power, compared with the trying to recruit as an ex-employee, (ii) the advantage of stealth and secrecy, so that management are unaware and do not take defensive measures, and (iii) conversely, the advantage sometimes of being able to work speedily and not having to be covert.
Fifth, the nature and length of the ‘springboard’ relief should be fair and just in all the circumstances.”
The general principles relating to the duty of fidelity are well established. They were helpfully summarised by Haddon-Cave J in QBE Management Services Ltd at [169]:
It is indisputable that an employee owes his employer a contractual duty of ‘fidelity’, but how far it extends will depend on the facts of each case (per Lord Green MR in Hivac v Park Royal [1946] Ch 169 at 174).
The more senior the staff the greater the degree of loyalty, fidelity and diligence required (per Openshaw J in UBS Wealth Management (UK) Ltd v Vestra Wealth LLP [2008] EWHC 1974 (QB), [2008] IRLR 965 at para graph 10).
The first task of the court is to identify the nature of the employee’s obligations of fidelity and then to decide whether the employee’s activities are in breach (per Moses LJ in Helmet Integrated Systems v Tunnard [2006] EWCA Civ 1735, [2007] IRLR 126 at paragraph 32).
The mere fact that activities are described by an employee as ‘preparatory’ to competition does not mean that they are legitimate (per Moses LJ in Helmet Integrated Systems v Tunnard [2007] IRLR 126, at paragraph 28).
It is a breach of the duty of fidelity for an employee to recruit or solicit another employee to act in competition (see British Midland Tool v Midland International Tooling Ltd [2003] EWHC 466 (Ch), [2003] 2 BCLC 523).
Attempts by senior employees to solicit more junior staff constitutes particularly serious misconduct (Sybron Corp v Rochem Ltd [1983] IRLR 253).
It is a breach of the duty of fidelity for an employee to misuse confidential information belonging to his employer (see Faccenda Chicken Ltd v Fowler [1986] IRLR 69).
The court should ask whether the activities in which the employee is engaged affect his ability to serve his employer faithfully and honestly and to the best of his abilities (see Shepherds Investments Ltd v Walters [2006] EWHC 836 (Ch), [2007] IRLR 110 at paragraph 131).”
Submissions
The parties provided written submissions at the outset of the case and produced very detailed written closing submissions after all of the evidence had been heard. These were then supplemented by oral argument which took one day. I shall set out the key points made by the parties here and then discuss them further when I carry out my analysis of the legal arguments as applied to the facts that I have found.
Post-termination restraints
Mr Paul Goulding KC, who appeared on behalf of Dare with Jamie Susskind, Christian Davies and Aliya Al-Yassin, submitted that the post-termination restraints were enforceable as against the Defendants. The justification for the Non-Compete Covenant was twofold. First, it was needed to protect Dare’s confidential information. Second, it would be impossible to police the other post-termination restraints as Dare would have no way of knowing whether ex-employees were using its confidential information, or soliciting its trade connections, or tapping up its staff. It would just suffer harm. Dare submits that the length of the covenants is reasonable as a period of at least one year is required to protect the business’ confidential information, which has a shelf-life of more than one year, and it would take at least one year for Dare to rebuild its connections with traders, brokers and counterparties, and to secure the stability of its workforce.
With respect to the covenant restraining the solicitation of contacts, Mr Goulding KC submitted that relationships with brokers, in particular, are of significant value. Those relationships have been cultivated by Senior Traders for Dare’s benefit over many years. The Defendants made themselves popular with brokers, forming strong personal relationships with them. The non-solicitation covenants were needed to ensure that the Defendants did not exploit their personal knowledge of and influence over the brokers.
With respect to the non-dealing covenants, Mr Goulding KC submitted that they were appropriate in the highly specialist market in which the parties operate. The Defendants’ eventual return to the market was likely to be loudly publicised with the effect that they are likely to be approached by Dare’s trade connections with whom they have strong relationships, without the Defendants needing to solicit them.
With respect to the non-poaching covenants, Mr Goulding KC submitted that Dare’s employees were prime targets for poaching. The Defendants were responsible for managing and training individuals on their desks, and had influence over them.
With respect to remedy, Dare sought to enforce the post-termination restraints until they expire on 11 July 2025 (one year after the Defendants’ termination from employment). Mr Goulding KC submitted that there were no exceptional circumstances that could deprive Dare of its contractual entitlement and a final injunction. Neither Defendant had been put on “Garden Leave”, and neither Defendant had been too sick to work.
Mr Solomon KC, who appeared on behalf of D1 along with Matthew Sheridan, submitted that Dare had no legitimate business interests to protect by way of the post-termination restraints. D1 denied that, at the time the contract of employment was entered into in 2021, it was objectively intended or contemplated by the parties that D1 would have access to confidential information which would be memorable and sufficiently valuable to a competitor to justify restrictions lasting for a period of as long as 12 months after he ceased working for Dare. Mr Solomon KC submitted that Dare was attempting to dress up as ‘confidential information’ strategies and techniques developed by D1 during the course of his employment, and which formed part of his general knowledge, skill and experience which he was entitled to take away with him. Other alleged confidential information was acquired by D1 on a ‘one-off’ basis long after he signed his contract of employment, and is not evidence of what was contemplated by the parties at the time he signed years earlier. In any event, the value of the alleged confidential information which the Non-Compete Covenant was intended to protect was negligible and/or equivalent information could be easily formulated or obtained from third parties.
With respect to trade connections, D1 disputed that, at the time that the contract of employment was entered into, it was objectively intended or contemplated by the parties that he would gain personal knowledge or influence over intermediaries or counterparties which would continue for a period of 12 months after he ceased working for Dare. Relationships with brokers were accepted to be of limited value, but did not require 12 months protection after D1’s departure from employment.
As for the stability of the workforce, D1 disputed that, at the time that he entered into the contract of employment with Dare, it was objectively intended or contemplated by the parties that he would gain influence over Dare’s staff which would continue for a period of 12 months after he ceased working for Dare.
Mr Solomon KC also submitted that some of the wording of the post-termination restraints rendered them unenforceable. With respect to the non-competition covenant, it was submitted that:
the words “or about to be in competition with” were too uncertain to be enforceable;
the scope of the Non-Compete Covenant was too broad: (i) restricting D1 from being employed in a competing business irrespective of whether his employment is in a role which would threaten Dare’s alleged legitimate business interests; and/or (ii) it restricts him from being employed in any business which competes with the business of Dare in relation to which he had access to “Field Materials” at any time during his employment (even if he ceased to have access to such confidential information long before the termination of his employment).
With respect to the non-solicitation of contacts and non-dealing covenants, Mr Solomon KC submitted that:
the scope and duration of those covenants was too broad because they restrict D1 from soliciting/dealing with persons who were Restricted Contacts or Prospective Restricted Contacts during the 12 months prior to him ceasing to work for Dare in relation to whom he had access to Field Materials at any time during his employment (regardless of whether he had any dealings with them during the 12 months prior to the termination of his employment). Some of the Field Materials would cease to be valuable to a competitor and/or be memorable by the end of 12 months after D1 ceased working for Dare;
the duration of the non-solicitation and non-dealing covenants was too long because Dare would not need as long as 12 months since D1 ceased working for it to shore-up its relationships with its Restricted Contacts or Prospective Restricted Contacts; and
further, it would in practice be impossible to work elsewhere in competition with the activities with which D1 was involved at Dare without dealing with the same intermediaries (ie. brokers and exchanges) and executing trades with the same trading counterparties (ie. other traders of securities). It follows that the effect of the non-solicitation and non-dealing covenants would, in practice, be the same as a covenant against competition;
As for the non-poaching covenant, Mr Solomon KC submitted that:
the words “is likely to be able to assist or benefit a business in, or proposing to be in, competition with” are too uncertain to be enforceable;
the scope of the non-poaching covenant was too broad insofar as it restrains the employment of former colleagues. Such restraints are objectionable as a matter of principle; and
the scope and duration of the non-poaching covenant was too broad: (i) it restricts D1 from employing or otherwise engaging Dare employees irrespective of their role or seniority; (ii) it restricts D1 from employing or otherwise engaging Dare employees whom he managed at any time during his employment. By the end of 12 months after ceasing to work for Dare, D1 would have no influence over employees whom he ceased to manage several years in the past; (iii) it restricts him from employing or otherwise engaging Dare employees who are in possession of Field Materials: (a) even if such confidential information related to a part of Dare’s business with which D1 was not involved and would be very unlikely to compete with after leaving Dare; and (b) even if the Field Materials were created long before D1 ceased working for Dare; and (iv) it restricts him from employing or otherwise engaging Dare employees with whom D1 merely had “material dealings” during the 12 months prior to him ceasing to work for Dare even if he did not work closely with them. Merely having material dealings with a colleague would not give D1 influence over them for a period of as long as 12 months after ceasing to work for Dare.
In any event, Mr Solomon KC submitted that even if the covenants were enforceable, the Court should exercise its discretion to refuse a final injunction for the following reasons:
by reason of D1’s absence from work during his notice period because of sickness and, subsequently, his interim undertakings to the Court, by the time the Court gives judgment after trial Dare will in effect already have had the benefit of the 12 months’ protection afforded by the covenants;
alternatively, D1 was put on “Garden Leave” shortly after his resignation and, pursuant to the terms of the contract of employment, the duration of the covenants falls to be reduced by the period spent on Garden Leave. The result (again) is that by the time the Court gives judgment after trial Dare will in effect already have had the benefit of the 12 months’ protection afforded by the Covenants.
Mr de Silva KC, who appeared on behalf of D2 with Sophia Berry, submitted that the post-termination restraints were not enforceable against D2. First, it was not objectively intended or contemplated at the time that D2 entered into the contract of employment that such confidential information as he would have access to would have a shelf-life or be sufficiently memorable and valuable to justify a 12-month covenant. What was contemplated was that D2 would use his general skill and knowledge rather than confidential information, to trade crude oil derivative products. The information relied upon by Dare was either publicly available or not (and not intended to be) shared with D2. Other information (such as trading positions) did not have a shelf-life of 12 months or else was too difficult to memorise for D2 to be able to take it away. D2 did not, for example, have access to Dare’s ‘Tradr’ software system, which was used to view the Crude desk’s positions and their profit/loss and did not write the programming code within it (and he would not in any event have been able to memorise this).
Secondly, it was not objectively intended or contemplated at the time of entering the contract of employment that D2 would have knowledge of or influence over connections such as exchanges or counterparties to trades (who are often anonymous). While it was anticipated that D2 would have a close relationship with the brokers used by Dare, there was no legitimate interest to protect in such relationships, as it is the traders who are the clients of the brokers and brokers are subject to regulatory obligations (for example in relation to conflicts of interest) which preclude them from favouring Dare over their other clients (or vice versa). In any event, these connections did not justify keeping D2 out of the market for a year.
Thirdly, it was not objectively intended that D2 would have influence over other staff. He was not on the management team. He had a limited role in recruitment, e.g. conducting interviews, but was not responsible for this. Again, workforce stability did not justify 12-month covenants here.
As for the specific wording of the covenants, it was submitted by D2 that these were unreasonably wide:
the non-competition covenant would prohibit D2 from being engaged in a competing business in any role, including a non-trading role where Dare’s legitimate business interests would not be threatened;
the non-solicitation covenants were framed as prohibiting D2 from canvassing or soliciting the “investment business” of, or introduced by, Restricted Contacts and Prospective Restricted Contacts which includes for example brokers. However, brokers do not provide or introduce “investment business” (or any business) to trading firms such as Dare; and
the non-poaching covenant prohibited D2 from employing an employee of Dare even where the employee has approached D2 without having been solicited.
In any event, Mr de Silva KC submitted that even if the covenants were enforceable the Court should exercise its discretion to refuse relief given that D2 had been out of the market since 14 February 2024.
Breach of contract and springboard relief
Mr Goulding KC referred to a number of express contractual duties owed by the Defendants, and submitted that these were breached by D1 and/or D2:
the Defendants were obliged to work from their offices during their normal working hours (being Monday to Friday between the hours of 8am and 6pm), and any additional hours as may be necessary, and perform all necessary duties associated with their position, as well as any other duties assigned by Dare from time to time;
the Defendants were obliged to devote their full working time, attention and energies to the faithful and diligent performance of their duties;
the Defendants were obliged to use their best efforts to promote and protect the interests of Dare;
the Defendants were obliged to comply with all reasonable and lawful directions given by Dare;
the Defendants were obliged to comply with all policies and procedures issued by Dare;
the Defendants were obliged to keep Dare fully informed of their conduct, the business, finances and affairs of Dare, and any wrongdoing committed by themselves or any other employee of Dare;
the Defendants were prohibited from disclosing or otherwise misusing Dare’s confidential and proprietary information;
the Defendants were prohibited from being directly or indirectly engaged or concerned with any similar or competing business during the course of the employment relationship.
With respect to D1, Mr Goulding KC submitted that he could have worked some of the time during the notice period, and even if he was unable to work during any part of the notice period by reason of ill-health this was D1’s fault.
Mr Goulding KC submitted that Dare questions the real motivation for D1 going off sick, although it was now accepted that he did suffer from the chronic condition. Mr Goulding KC argued that D1 had no intention of working his notice period, irrespective of the state of his health: this was evidenced by the terms of the initial indemnity that he signed with Onyx which was premised on him needing to be placed on garden leave for substantially all of his notice period; D1’s plans for Dubai tax residency which could save him a significant amount in taxes, and which necessitated him leaving the United Kingdom by 2024-April-5, spending 90 days or less and doing no more than 39 days’ work in the United Kingdom in the 2024-25 tax year; as well as his desire to have a “gap year” between jobs.  Mr Goulding KC pointed to D1’s activity during his notice period which was inconsistent with someone who could not work at all because of ill health.
Mr Solomon KC disputed Dare’s contentions, submitting that D1 was genuinely unable to work for any part of the notice period, as was borne out by the medical evidence.
With respect to D2, Mr Goulding KC submitted that, first, he failed to work his notice period when he had no genuine sickness. Second, during his notice period, D2 undertook extensive work on behalf of Onyx (visiting their premises in Dubai and offering to find permanent premises, working on their energy trading and risk management system and their pricing sheets), and shared confidential information with them (conﬁdential statistics concerning Dare’s trading activity, conﬁdential information about Dare’s terms of business with a key trade connection, Dare’s remuneration structures, and the performance and management of the Crude desk at Dare). Third, D2 solicited employees, including Mr Law. Fourth, D2 solicited brokers and counterparties.
D2 disputes this. Mr de Silva KC contended that illness was the genuine reason for D2 being off sick. His illness was also closely related to his anxiety in having to deal with Mr Rahman. D2 denied that he sought to solicit Mr Law to join Onyx. To the contrary, he tried to dissuade him from doing so. D2 also sought to dissuade Onyx from recruiting Dare’s staff. Mr de Silva KC also argued that D2 did not work for Onyx during his notice period, nor did he disclose confidential information to them.
Mr Goulding KC submitted that in addition to damages for breach of contract, Dare was entitled to springboard relief as against the Defendants. It was contended that the springboard advantage obtained by the Defendants was overwhelming, and that Dare should be entitled to relief as against them both. Dare was deprived of their services for the duration of their notice periods. This not only caused a freefall in trading revenues but meant there was no handover: there was no help with third party relationships; no plan for recruiting and training replacements; and no plan for managing their extremely complex strategies and positions. Further, Dare has not been able to expand into planned markets as a result of it having to reallocate resources to deal with the failure of the Defendants to work their notice periods. Yet further, the Defendants had destabilised Dare’s business.
Mr Goulding KC submitted that the Defendants and Onyx should not be permitted to exploit the disarray on Dare’s Propane and Naphtha, and Crude desks by establishing a dominant position in those markets at Dare’s expense; or to exploit D2’s solicitation of Dare’s brokers and other trade connections; or to exploit the confidential information passed by D2 to Onyx. Mr Goulding KC argued that the Defendants and Onyx had stolen a march on Dare, and the competitive advantage could not be adequately compensated in damages. Dare was asking for no more than to be put in the position that it would have been in had the Defendants respected their obligations: their employment would not have been brought to an early end, and they would not have been able to commence work for Onyx until 20 November 2025 with respect to D1, and 14 February 2026 with respect to D2 at the earliest. The Court was invited to grant an injunction until those dates as this reflected the length of time that it would have taken for the wrongdoers to achieve lawfully what they have in fact achieved unlawfully.
With respect to D1, Mr Goulding KC submitted that if he had not acted unlawfully he would have agreed to perform the tasks that Mr Rahman asked him to do, providing a full hand-over and training up of other traders on the Propane and Naphtha desks; managing a smooth transition in broker and other trade relationships; and that he may also have traded on another desk, or come back to trading on the Propane and Naphtha desks. With respect to D2, Mr Goulding KC submitted that he would have continued working on the Crude Oil desk, training up juniors on the job and completing a proper handover, including handing over relationships with brokers and other connections. As a result, Mr Rahman and Mr Ooi would have remained focused on their usual tasks and would not have needed to step back into active trading, and would not have been sidetracked by the litigation that has ensued.
Mr Goulding KC also pointed to the mass resignations that resulted from the Defendants’ wrongdoings, arguing that it was highly implausible that the wave of resignations was a coincidence or unrelated to the fact that the Defendants left the business and claimed to be sick.
Mr Goulding KC pointed to the advantages that have been obtained by Onyx: as a result of the Defendants’ wrongdoing (i) both Defendants will be able to join them sooner than otherwise would have been the case; (ii) the Defendants will be able to start work for Onyx in a context in which Dare is much weakened; (iii) with respect to D2, he and Onyx will be able to benefit from his specific wrongdoing in the significant preparatory work designed to allow him to hit the ground running when he arrives in Dubai.
The Defendants deny that any springboard advantage was obtained by them, and they submit that no relief should be granted against them. They contend that it was fanciful to suggest that the workforce was destabilised by their departure. On D2’s particular case, Mr de Silva KC points specifically to the recruitment of an experienced crude oil trader as D2’s replacement from June 2024.
With respect to relief, Mr Goulding KC contends that the post-termination restraints should be enforced against the Defendants in the ordinary way. There is no “exceptional” reason not to. The Court, in the exercise of its discretion as to whether to grant an injunction should not take into account the fact that the Defendants did not work their notice periods. The post-termination restraints should be enforced for 12 months from the date of termination. To decide otherwise would, it was submitted, risk setting a dangerous precedent. It would encourage a practice whereby employees would assert that they were too sick to work, thereby not only avoiding working their notice periods but then also claiming that the Court should not enforce their restrictive covenants. This would constitute a “cheat’s charter”.
Fiduciary Duties
Mr Goulding KC submitted that the Defendants were fiduciaries and owed Dare fiduciary duties. Reliance was placed on the dictum of Elias J in Nottingham University v Fishel [2000] ICR 1462 at 1493E-F:
‘… in determining whether a fiduciary relationship arises in the context of an employment relationship, it is necessary to identify with care the particular duties undertaken by the employee, and to ask whether in all the circumstances he has placed himself in a position where he must act solely in the interest of his employer. It is only once those duties have been identified that it is possible to determine whether any fiduciary duty has been breached"".”.
Reference was also made to Otkritie International Investment Management Limited v Urumov [2014] EWHC 191 (Comm) at [72] were Eder J stated that:
“In the employment context, the courts typically look to the employee's contractual obligations and the circumstances of his employment, for example seniority, managerial responsibility, decision making autonomy, independence and the vulnerability of the employer, which may justify holding the employee bound by a duty of loyalty to the employer”.
Mr Goulding KC also submitted that senior employees responsible for managing important client relationships will often owe fiduciary duties to their employer (see e.g. Richard Baker Harrison Ltd v Brooks [2021] EWHC 2562 (QB), at [98]-[101]). Similarly, where an employee is entrusted with company property (including confidential information) and relied upon to deal with it for the company’s benefit, he will owe fiduciary duties in that regard: see Zenith Logistics v Keates [2022] EWHC 1496 (Comm) at [184].
Mr Goulding KC submitted that, in light of these principles, the Defendants were classic fiduciary employees. They were entrusted with Dare’s capital. They were entrusted with managing Dare’s important third-party relationships. They were entrusted with company property (including Dare’s confidential information) and permitted to exploit it for Dare’s benefit.
As a consequence, Mr Goulding KC submitted that the Defendants owed fiduciary duties (i) to act in good faith, exclusively in the best interests of Dare and not in their own; (ii) not to place themselves in a position where their duties to Dare conflicted with their own personal interests; and to disclose: (a) any competitive threat to Dare of which they were aware; and (b) their own wrongdoing and that of others.
Both of the Defendants denied that they were fiduciaries. They were not statutory directors and did not hold senior management positions. With respect to D1, Mr Solomon KC submitted that any such duty is, in any event, attenuated where the employee is not actively working.
Discussion
The post-termination restraints
I shall first consider the proper construction of the covenants. I shall then consider whether they are, in principle, enforceable. I shall then set out my reasoning as to whether, and if so to what extent, they should be enforced against the Defendants. The latter analysis will involve consideration of the Garden Leave provision in the contract of employment and whether it was activated in the case of either Defendant.
Are the covenants enforceable (subject to the length of the restraints)?
I shall look firstly at the non-competition covenant, as this is the covenant that was most hotly contested by the parties. The first step is to construe the covenant against the background of the contract.
The legitimate business interests that are explicitly relied upon by Dare for the post-termination restraints, are (i) Dare’s “Field Materials”; (ii) relationships with “Restricted Contacts” and “Prospective Restricted Clients” (which is plainly a typographical error, as the definition section refers to “Prospective Restricted Contact”); and (iii) valued employee and consultant relationships. “Field Materials” has an extensive definition. “Restricted Contacts” is defined as “any person acting in the capacity of a broker, market maker or other intermediary or trading counterparty” to Dare.
As a matter of principle, each of these matters could be legitimate business interests that Dare was entitled to protect by appropriate post-termination restraints.
The Defendants took issue with various aspects of the non-competition covenant. First, it was said that the term “business” at paragraph 13(c) must refer to “business entity”, rather than a type of business. They contended that an individual cannot be “employed by any business”, in a functional sense, but only by a “business entity”. Further, the clause refers to shareholding as an exception to the rule, and this can only be a shareholding in a “business entity”. If the Defendants’ construction is correct, then it was contended that the covenant was too wide as it would seek to prohibit the employee from having any involvement in a business entity which competed with a business entity of Dare “with which [the employee] was materially involved at any time during the [relevant period] or in relation to which he had access to Field Material”, even if he was to be engaged in a part of a new business entity which was not in competition with the area of Dare’s business where he had worked. There could be no legitimate business interest for Dare to protect as the confidential information, or trading connections, or employee knowledge, that the employee had would not be relevant to, or used by, the new position with the competitor.
I agree that on the Defendants’ preferred construction the covenant would not be enforceable. I disagree, however, with their preferred construction. I consider that the term “business” is to be construed functionally rather than formally. That is, it refers to the type of business that the employee was engaged in – e.g. Propane and Naphtha for D1, and Crude Oil for D2 – and not the more generic liquidity provision in the global energy markets. That is a realistic construction of the contract, and according to the validity principle (as referred to in Egon Zender), that is the construction which the Court should prefer as the parties are deemed to have meant to enter into a valid agreement, not an invalid one. This is a realistic construction because it fits with the way in which the term “business” is referred to elsewhere in the post-termination restraints. Thus, clauses 13(c)(ii) and (iii) of the contract of employment refer to “investment business” of a person; the reference there is to the functional kind of business which is “investment”, rather than a business entity which is an “investment business”.
Second, the Defendants contend that the phrase “or about to be in competition” is too vague to be enforceable. The Defendants submit that they would not know whether they could start work with a particular employer as they might not know if the future employer was “about to be in competition” with the business of Dare, or how that phrase is to be evaluated. I disagree. The ordinary meaning of “about to be” is that something is imminent; it will apply to a business that is on the cusp of competing with Dare. Thus, it would apply to an entity that was setting up, say, a Crude Oil trading desk as soon as an employee arrived, but was not presently trading in Crude Oil. In any event, even if the phrase was too vague as to be enforceable, it could easily be severed from the remainder of the covenant without changing the overall meaning or tenor of the non-competition restraint.
Third, the Defendants argue that the non-competition covenant was plainly too wide because it applies to a competitor of the business of Dare “in relation to which [the employee]… had access to Field Material” at any time during his employment with Dare. Thus, if the employee had access to confidential information belonging to Dare at the outset of his employment and the shelf-life of that information had expired early on in his employment, he would be prohibited from working for the competitor even if he wanted to work there several years later. I disagree with this contention. The proper construction of the contract is that the relevant access to information applies to the employee’s material involvement in the Dare business, which applies to the phrase “at any time during the Relevant Period”, which is itself defined as “12 months prior to the Termination Date”. That is a realistic reading of the clause: that the temporal qualification for material involvement in the business also qualifies the access to “Field Materials”. Accordingly, the non-competition covenant applies to a competitor of the business of Dare in relation to which the employee had access to Field Materials at any time during the 12 months prior to the Termination Date. I will deal further below with whether this is reasonable.
Fourth, the Defendants contend that the non-competition covenant does not define the capacity in which the former employee is prohibited from working for a competitor of Dare. The Defendants submit that the covenant therefore seeks to prohibit them from working as, say, a cleaner or administrative assistant for Onyx. It seems to me that this is an “extravagant”, “fantastical”, “unlikely or improbable” scenario (per Boydell at [23], and so should be rejected as a possible construction of the restraint.
A further issue of construction that the parties disagreed about was clause 13(d). This provides that “The periods for which the restrictions in paragraphs 13(c) apply shall be reduced by any time Employee spends on Garden Leave immediately prior to the termination of his employment”. The effect of this clause is to reduce the period of the various post-termination restraints (including the non-competition covenant) when the Defendant has been placed on “Garden Leave”. The Defendants contend that, under this clause, Dare could put an employee on “Garden Leave” for the bulk of the notice period, and then so long as the employee is allowed to perform their normal job duties just before the end of employment, none of the earlier period when the employee did not work, or did not perform “specified services”, would be reduced from the term of the post-termination covenant.
Mr Goulding KC contended that this was not the proper way to read the clause. He argued that the Defendants’ interpretation was a scenario dreamed up by lawyers that was “extravagant”, “fantastical”, “unlikely or improbable” (per Boydell at [23]. In any event, Mr Goulding KC argued that the matter went to the question of enforcement and not to the enforceability of the covenant, acknowledging in this regard that a Court would not enforce a further 12 month period where an employee had already spent much of the previous 12 months on “Garden Leave”.
I agree with the Defendants’ interpretation of this clause. The adverb “immediately” qualifies the subsequent words “prior to the termination of his employment”, and must have some meaning. The ordinary meaning would be to refer to the period towards the end of the notice period, just, or shortly, before the termination of employment date. I note, in this regard, that clause 13(d) refers to “termination of his employment” and not to “Termination Date” which is a phrase which is specifically defined in the contract of employment. There does not appear to be any reason why the two phrases should mean anything different. Mr Goulding KC suggested in oral argument that the phrase “termination of his employment” might refer to the giving of notice. That would not make sense, however, as an employee is highly unlikely to be put on “Garden Leave” before notice of termination has been issued whether by the employer or employee and, more importantly, the “Garden Leave” provisions only kick in after notice of termination has been given.
The effect of this interpretation is that, on its face, Dare would have been able to place the Defendants on “Garden Leave” for some, or even the bulk, of the notice period (clause 7(a) entitles Dare to place the employee on “Garden Leave” “until a specified date or the termination of” employment), and so long as the Defendants were required to work normally thereafter up until their final day of employment, the post-termination restraints would not be reduced by the time spent on “Garden Leave”.  In other words, the earlier period of being on “Garden Leave” would not count towards any contractual reduction in the period of the post-termination restraints.
Nevertheless, I do not consider, that the presence of clause 13(d), even with this construction, renders the post-termination restraint unenforceable. There is no requirement to have a set off clause for garden leave in a contract of employment. Furthermore, at the time when the contract of employment was entered into it could not be contemplated that this clause would be used by Dare in any particular, let alone in a cynical, way. Rather than rendering the post-termination restraint unenforceable, the way in which the clause was used in fact would be relevant to the Court’s exercise of discretion as to enforcement.
Dealing further with the legitimate business interests that Dare was entitled, as a matter of principle, to protect, it is notable that the contracts entered into by the Defendants were designed for employment as Senior Traders: that is, as the person who would be responsible for a particular trading desk. This is a role where the Senior Trader would have a great deal of autonomy, with the responsibility for trading with Dare’s capital, would set the trading strategy (or would play a significant role in the setting of the strategy), and as head of the relevant desk would have responsibility for guiding, providing on-the-job training and generally overseeing other staff, including more junior traders.
When the Senior Trader contracts were entered into, it was inevitable that the post-holder would have access to some of Dare’s confidential information. That information would include the “pnl” of the particular desk, including the overall administration cost for that desk, for which the Senior Trader was responsible: this was information that was factored into the bonus calculation for the Senior Trader. I consider that this information would be confidential to Dare: it would not be known outside of Dare, was treated by Dare as confidential, and would be of some use to a competitor, and to the detriment of Dare, if the information was provided to a competitor as it could assist them in (i) understanding how much they might need to spend to build up a desk that was comparable to Dare; and (ii) understanding what returns could be achieved on a particular desk.
At the outset of the contract, it was contemplated that the Defendants, as Senior Traders, would have access to Dare’s confidential trading strategies, including pricing ratios or formulae for the products that they traded. The Defendants, as Senior Traders, would also be contemplated to have access to methodologies and ways of working that Dare had developed and which assisted the business in its day-to-day trading activities. The Defendants would not necessarily know, let alone understand, the coding that lay behind Dare’s methodologies, but they would know what functionality was available to them and how it could be used to their advantage as traders. In this regard, I note that on 18 November 2022, Jamie Hendry (Dare’s Director of Trading Development) sent an email to traders at Dare, in which he stated that:
“In an effort to spread around the knowledge of the features we have implemented for other desks and those we have the capability to do we have put together this list. Any of the features and possibilities listed may add value to your desk in ways you may not have considered or have considered no feasible”.
Mr Rahman responded to Mr Hendry’s email to say:
“I absolutely LOVE this.
So much value here!”.
It is correct that Senior Traders would not necessarily know or remember all of the detail about the different arrangements or formulae or ratios, but they would be exposed to the information on so many occasions that it would be likely that key details would be remembered or subject to recall from “the recesses of the mind” at a later date. A particular example of this would be the lay-out of pricing sheets, which would enable Senior Traders to execute more trades and/or at a faster pace; or the functionalities that competitors do not have. I set out more detail with respect to the arguments and my findings on confidentiality in the confidential annexe.
The Senior Trader would be likely to have access to information about business areas that Dare was preparing to enter, and even some of the steps that had already been taken. Although the Senior Trader would initially work on one desk trading a particular set of products, they would not be expected to trade on that desk for their entire career, and might be expected to have discussions with senior management at Dare about other trading opportunities for them. It would also be contemplated that Senior Traders might be encouraged to discuss with senior management at Dare trading opportunities that they had learned about for further investigation by the company.
There was evidence that this had, in fact, happened during the course of D1’s employment. On 17 August 2023, D1 had a WhatsApp exchange with Mr Ooi:
“D1: I hate propane
When am I getting a new market?!
Mr Ooi: Looks like October 1st
D1: Oh which?!
Mr Ooi: You were interested in [x: a different market] right? . . .
So will hopefully be [x]
D1: . . . Just want to make lots please”.
Similarly, with respect to D2. In a WhatsApp exchange with Mr Ooi on 1 February 2022, D2 stated: “just thought I would mention what I have sent to Ayman. I really like the sound of the [y] markets. . . . I see great potential there”.  On 7 July 2023, there was an email exchange among senior management in which it was stated that D2 “not to be allowed to start trading [z]”, which referred to a discussion that was being had at the time about setting up another market within the Crude desk.
It would also have been contemplated that Senior Traders would have knowledge of the positions held by their respective desks. These positions would not be known outside of Dare’s business and knowledge of them could be of real use to a competitor as it could affect their strategy as to what to buy, or not to buy. It was also suggested that the knowledge of Dare’s positions might enable a competitor to “squeeze” Dare, which was in my judgment not a fanciful possibility given the competitive nature of the markets.
I do not consider that it would have been contemplated that Senior Traders would have knowledge of the positions held by other desks, or the “pnl” of other desks. The Senior Traders’ primary focus was activity on their own desk. Whilst they would have been expected to have a general understanding of what was happening elsewhere within Dare’s business, this would not necessarily mean that they would have been expected to be familiar with long-term positions held by other desks. That information would not ordinarily be of any interest to the Senior Trader.  Indeed, this was borne out by the evidence of what did actually happen during the course of the Senior Traders’ employment following their signing of the contracts of employment in 2021. Mr Ooi gave evidence that he had told D1 about a long-term position held by Dare in a particular market. That information was, even on Mr Ooi’s case, passed on during a conversation that he had with D1. D1 denied that this conversation had taken place. I prefer D1’s evidence with respect to that matter. There was no mention made of this conversation in the very detailed witness statement produced by Mr Ooi. If the conversation had occurred as he relayed it, it is very surprising that it did not appear in his witness statement. In any event, even if this conversation did take place, it seems to have been happenstance that this information came to D1’s attention, and was not something that would have been predicted to occur when the contract of employment was signed.
Similarly with respect to strategic business information: that is, the profitability of different markets, strategies on entering new markets. I do not consider that it was contemplated that this would have been expected to be known or drawn to the attention of the Senior Traders as a general matter, as opposed to profitability or strategies with respect to markets that they traded on or may trade on going forward. As it happens, information of this kind was shown to D2 at the presentation on 26 September 2023 before the meal at the Sushi Samba restaurant, but this was a one-off, and the information was put on the screen for around 2 minutes and it could not reasonably have been expected that D2 was able to take the material down or recall it.
I do not consider that it would have been contemplated that Senior Traders would have knowledge of the bespoke remuneration arrangements made with others working at their level. These arrangements would have been confidential to the specific trader. They are usually specifically negotiated between the Senior Trader and the employer; they would be impressed with confidentiality as the employer would not want other employees to know of their precise details. As for more junior employees, I accept that the Senior Traders would not have been expected to know their bespoke renumeration packages. Nevertheless, it would have been contemplated that a Senior Trader would know, or would have access to, the overall remuneration packages for them, as this would be relevant to the costs associated with their particular desk. This overall, or total, information could be of value to a competitor and would be categorised as confidential information.
I do not consider that it would have been contemplated that Senior Traders would have knowledge of the specific training arrangements that junior employees would engage in prior to joining their desk. Senior Traders would not be expected to be involved in that earlier training. Once the juniors joined their desk, they would generally learn on the job, under the guidance and instruction of the Senior Trader. There was nothing confidential about this training, other than some of the subject matter that might be discussed, which would be covered under one of the other headings of confidential information.
I do not consider that it would have been contemplated that Senior Traders would be aware of Dare’s strategic hiring decisions. As already discussed, the main focus for the Senior Traders would be their own desks and so they would be likely to be made aware of impending recruitment decisions with respect to that desk. They would not have been expected to know the same thing about other desks. This was borne out by the subsequent evidence of what did happen. From time to time the Defendants were involved in the interview process for potential hires to Dare. They would not necessarily be informed of the general hiring strategy that Dare was adopting towards any particular area other than their own. The interviews seemed to be ad hoc. Nevertheless, I do accept that it would have been reasonably contemplated that the stability of Dare’s workplace was a valuable interest to be protected. Dare would have been expected to invest and develop their staff, and the Senior Traders would have been expected to have some hold over them as people to learn from and look up to.
With respect to trading relationships, Senior Traders would have been expected to build relationships with and gain knowledge about brokers, intermediaries (that is, the exchanges on which products were traded) and trading counterparties: who they were and what they did or could offer to Dare. These were all essential trading relationships for Senior Traders, and Senior Traders would be expected to develop personal relationships with some of the key personnel as this could improve business opportunities. With respect to brokers, the relationship was primarily one of the Senior Trader being the client, with the broker making money from the trades made by Dare and so the broker would be incentivised to create good relationships with traders, but it was not a one-directional thing. Senior Traders would also be expected to obtain, from time to time, confidential information from brokers about trading opportunities: what was described in the evidence as a ‘First Look’. This might not happen frequently, but they could be valuable when they did occur. In this regard, the Court was shown a WhatsApp exchange on 7 February 2023 between a broker and D2, in which the broker informed D2 that she was “looking for a bid for” a type of client, and informed D2 that she was “just showing it to you guys first”.
With respect to intermediaries – which refers to the relevant exchanges – Dare would have bespoke pricing arrangements or at least pricing deals that were only available to a limited number of trading businesses and that fact would not be known by others in the particular market. The pricing arrangements, which may include rebates at a particular level of transactions, would be relevant to the ‘“pnl”’ of the Senior Traders’ desks and so of particular interest to them as part of their remuneration package. It would also have been contemplated that relationships between Senior Traders and relevant personnel at the exchanges may be useful in obtaining information from time to time. An example of this was provided to the Court with respect to D1. This was reflected in a WhatsApp exchange between D1 and Mr Ooi on 19 August 2021, where a particular trade had happened which Dare wanted to know more about, and D1 messaged that he had spoken to an individual at ICE to try to find out more, that she was going to try to find out what happened: “I’ll get it out of her, she loves me” is what D1 said.
With respect to counterparties, these were specific entities that would trade directly with Dare, not via the broker. The exchange would be the place through which the trade would be recorded, but the arrangements for the trade took place one-to-one with the counterparty. Trades with counterparties were not as numerous as those via brokers, but they could still be valuable, and so relationships with counterparties would also have been expected to be of importance to Dare. The evidence before the Court included various messages and interactions with counterparties. On 28 July 2023, in a WhatsApp exchange between D2 and Mr Rahman, D2 said “Got [counterparty] set up today direct. Just did 4k of deals in 10 mins lol”. Mr Rahman asked if they were good deals, to which D2 responded: “One was a massive de risk for 1x ent . . . The de risk at marks will hopefully bring our haircut down 4-6m if I had to guess”.
Given the nature of the confidential information that Dare was entitled to protect, the multiplicity of trading relationships that the Senior Traders were likely to have developed, and the importance of having a stable workforce, I consider that, in principle, a non-competition covenant was a reasonable means of providing Dare with protection. These were legitimate interests that Dare was entitled to protect, and it would not be feasible to protect the confidential information or broker relationships by way of a confidentiality clause or some form of non-solicitation or non-dealing clause, as these forms of restraint could not adequately be policed. It could not sensibly be ascertained if the Defendants would be using confidential information if engaged by a competitor to Dare, or if the Defendants had solicited business from a broker or was dealing with them. Similarly, a non-poaching of employee covenant would be difficult to police.
Are the covenants enforceable, given the duration of the restraints?
The key question as to enforceability is whether the duration of the non-competition covenant for 12 months is reasonable. In determining this matter, I am reminded that in QBE Management Services Ltd, Haddon-Cave J said at [215] that:
“it is only if the court finds that a ‘much less far-reaching’ covenant would have afforded adequate protection is it likely to regard the existing restriction as unreasonable. The exercise is not a marginal one, otherwise courts would be faced with a paralysing debate in every case about whether a covenant with x days shaved off would still provide adequate protection”.
A restraint for 12 months would be reasonable if, for instance, it was reasonably contemplated that the shelf-life of the confidential information which the Defendants were likely to have access to in the year preceding their termination date would extend for 12 months after the termination of their employment; or if Dare would need 12 months to develop new technology on systems that would take the place of confidential information that departing Senior Traders could pass on to their new employer; or if the trading relationships with brokers, intermediaries and counterparties required 12 months or more for a replacement to build up; or if the stability of the workforce required 12 months or more to be rebuilt following the Defendants’ departure.
Although the Court has received some evidence as to what the length of post-termination restraints by some other participants in the market, there is no “uncontradicted evidence of an industry standard” to which the Court can have regard in determining reasonableness: see Tradition Financial Services Ltd v Gamberoni [2007] IRLR 698 at [24], discussing Beckett Investment Management Group Ltd v Hall [2007] ICR 1539 at [29]. The only evidence before the Court was that there had been settlement agreements with various individuals after termination that were for a 12 month period. Under cross-examination, Mr Ooi said that Dare knew from recruiters that there were several firms with 12 month (or longer) post-termination restraints. Nevertheless, there was no documentary evidence to support this and no recruiter had been called to give evidence about this.
I do not consider that a 12 month restraint is reasonable to protect trading relationships or the stability of the workforce. Whilst I have no doubt that it was contemplated that the Defendants would, as Senior Traders, build trading relationships with brokers, intermediaries and counterparties, I do not consider that anywhere close to 12 months would be required for a replacement to build up an equivalent relationship. It was reasonably contemplated that others working on the relevant trading desks would already have, or be likely to have, some kind of relationship with brokers, intermediaries and counterparties at the time of the Defendants’ departure from Dare’s employment. Their identities and contact details are generally available from public sources. Furthermore, insofar as the brokers and intermediaries are concerned, they have a vested interest in building relationships with whoever is trading from the relevant desk. The traders are essentially the clients of both the brokers and the intermediaries. They make money from the number of trades that traders do. As for counterparties, there are not many of these as most of the trading carried out by Dare is anonymous, without knowing who the counterparty is.
I do not consider that a 12 month restraint is reasonable to protect the stability of the workforce. Whilst it was no doubt contemplated that the departure of a Senior Trader would have a destabilising impact on employees working on their particular desk, there was no real evidence to support the fact that it was contemplated that 12 months, or anything close to 12 months, would be required to find a replacement for the departing personnel. That replacement might be found externally, or through internal promotions.
I do find, however, that a 12 month restraint is reasonable to protect Dare’s  confidential information. It was reasonable to suppose that Dare had invested in and developed trading functionalities that would be bespoke or unique to Dare, providing Dare with a competitive edge. It would be reasonable to expect the Defendants to become familiar with some of these functionalities, and that if they relayed their knowledge of the functionality and the benefit that it afforded them in trading to a future employer, this would enable the future employer to build or develop the same or similar functionality, thereby blunting or diminishing Dare’s competitive advantage. It would have reasonably been expected for Dare to spend at least 12 months in developing replacement functionalities or systems. Furthermore, some of the specific information would have a shelf-life of more than 12 months.
I accept that much of the information about the positions held by the Senior Traders’ desks would have been expected to be out of date well before the end of the 12 month period, as not all positions would be expected to be held until their maturity. As was explored in evidence, positions held by desks, including those whose maturity was a number of years into the future, change on a daily basis. Nevertheless, this would not have been expected to apply to all positions. It was reasonable to think that some positions held by Senior Traders’ desks would be held for more than 12 months after their departure and that knowledge of these positions, which they would be able to carry away in their heads, would be of real benefit to a competitor if shared with them. Competitors might wish to build similar positions or to take steps in anticipation of those positions maturing.
Information about pricing ratios or formulae for the Defendant’s desks would also have been expected to have a shelf-life of far more than 12 months. The evidence before the Court was that these ratios remained relatively stable, and were the product of considerable research by Dare. I do not consider that it was likely that the ratios would be forgotten by the Defendants, even if they had not consciously committed them to memory. They were ratios that were traded on and applied repeatedly throughout the working day, and they were likely to have been remembered by the Defendants as if they were part of their general stock of knowledge. Even if not, they were likely to be dredged up from the recesses of their memories if they were put on a trading desk where they could be useful. Similarly with respect to the specific functionalities that the Defendants had access to and used as part of their regular trading, which provides Dare with a competitive advantage.
Similarly with the layout of the pricing sheet. This was not expected to change in any material way on a regular basis, and it was reasonably contemplated at the outset of the contract to last for more than 12 months. The evidence before the Court, which I accept, was that once a Senior Trader had become comfortable with a particular layout, they stuck with it so long as it was enabling them to trade successfully or effectively.
Similarly, with respect to information about rebates from brokers or the exchanges (intermediaries). The rebates obtained by Dare would not all have been expected to be negotiated on an annual, or shorter, basis.
The fact that more junior traders had shorter covenants (their restraints were for six months) but were also exposed to the same methodologies embedded in pricing sheets and risk management systems does not mean that lengthier protection was not required for the Senior Traders. The longer covenants for Senior Traders reﬂect the fact that they are going to be better able to (i) understand Dare’s conﬁdential information; (ii) understand the value of it; (iii) memorise it; and (iv) operationalise it for the beneﬁt of a competitor.
In the circumstances, therefore, I consider that the competition covenant is enforceable.
The same does not apply, however, to the other post-termination restraints. I do not consider that a 12 month restraint was required to protect Dare’s trading connections, whether via non-solicitation or non-dealing covenants. As explained above, these connections would have reasonably been expected to be rebuilt or refreshed in far less time. Similarly, with respect to non-poaching of employee covenant. I do not consider that it would have been reasonably contemplated that Dare would require anywhere close to 12 months to recruit and then train up relevant personnel.
Accordingly, I do not need to deal with any other issues relating to these restraints. Whether or not they were appropriately drafted, or protected legitimate business interests, they were unreasonably long and so not enforceable by Dare.
Were the Defendants put on Garden Leave?
The proper construction of the Defendants’ contracts of employment is that an employee is put on “Garden Leave” where Dare requires the employee not to work at all (“not to perform any services”). The employee is also put on “Garden Leave” where Dare requires the employee “to perform only specified services”. This clearly includes services which were not ordinarily performed by the employee previously. That is because clause 7(b) provides that Dare can, during any period of ""Garden Leave"", assign “other duties” to the employee. Other duties must mean duties “other than” what he was previously employed to carry out.
“Specified services” does not include the “handover” of the employee’s duties or responsibilities. Those duties or responsibilities are explicitly mentioned at clause 7(c) as assistance that the employee may be required to provide during “Garden Leave” period in any event.  Where an employee is asked to perform “handover” functions, therefore, this would form part of “Garden Leave”.
For D1, in the email message of 27 November 2023, Mr Rahman set out that he would be working during his notice period, and the initial tasks were to carry out certain actions with respect to the Propane Desk: preparing write-ups of Propane strategies that Dare had been pursuing, preparing a breakdown of a particular hedging analysis that had been used, and preparing a summary of the Propane brokers that D1 worked with, along with researching marketing strategies for certain product sectors that D1 had not engaged in. These were all duties or services that fell within the “Garden Leave” provision: they were either “handover” tasks, or were new tasks that had not been performed previously.
The email of 27 November 2023, referred to Mr Rahman and D1 sitting down to agree the next set of tasks for the next four month period, which included “leading the Sales Desk strategy and potentially trading on another desk”. These would be “specified services” because they were not matters that D1 had previously done.
It is clear to the Court, therefore, that initially (that is, from 27 November 2023) Dare exercised its discretion to place D1 on “Garden Leave” within the meaning of the contract of employment. The situation changed, however, on 22 February 2024. On that date, Mr Rahman wrote to D1 and told him that he was “happy for you to continue trading as normal on the Propane desk when you come back to work”, but was open to D1 carrying out other work that was commensurate with his role and seniority if he preferred. The suggestion that D1 return to carrying on trading as normal on the Propane desk was, in my judgment, genuine (see paragraphs 75-6 above). In contractual terms, it brought the “Garden Leave” period to an end as, if D1 had accepted the suggestion and returned to work, he would have been working in his usual role. In my judgment, therefore, D1 was on “Garden Leave” for three months (27 November 2023 to 22 February 2024).
Clause 13(d) provides that “The periods for which the restrictions in paragraphs 13(c) apply shall be reduced by any time Employee spends on Garden Leave immediately prior to the termination of his employment”.  Mr Goulding KC contended that D1 did not “spend” any time on “Garden Leave” as he was purportedly on sick leave during the period between his resignation and the termination of his employment by Dare on 10 July 2024. I disagree with this contention. Whether an employee “spends” any time on “Garden Leave” is a temporal matter; it is a question of whether the period of time in which “Garden Leave” was due to take place has actually occurred. It does not matter if the employee was sick, or purported to be sick, at that time. The sickness absence was from a period when the work that they would have performed had they attended work were services that fell within the definition of Garden Leave.
This period from 27 November 2023 to 22 February 2024, during which I have found D1 was put on “Garden Leave”, was not “immediately prior to the termination of [D1’s] employment” according to the construction of the contract that I have set out above at paragraph 244. Accordingly, under the terms of the contract of employment it is not reduced from the period of the post-termination restraints. The fact that D1 was placed on “Garden Leave” for that period and, in any event, did not work at all for Dare during the notice period – and so the benefit that Dare actually gained from his absence -may be relevant, however, to whether the Court should refuse to enforce the post-termination restraints.
For D2, he was asked to carry on trading on the Crude Oil desk at least for the first 6 months of his notice period. This was not a “specified service”. It was the work that he had previously performed. It is clear to the Court that D2 was not being placed on “Garden Leave”; rather he was being asked to work out his notice by carrying on his ordinary functions. D2 contended that the instruction for him to continue trading was not genuine. Whilst this may have been his perception, D2 did not put it to the test and, if Dare was bluffing, he had not called Dare’s bluff. In any event, I consider that the instruction was a genuine one.
There was good reason, at least initially, for Dare to instruct D2 to continue trading. Although there were other individuals who had worked on the Crude Oil desk with D2 who might be able to trade, they were not as expert and experienced as D2, and they ran a greater risk of incurring losses (or not making profit) for Dare than if D2 had continued working. Those other employees had only ever traded on the Crude Oil desk under D2’s supervision and guidance, and following the strategies that he had responsibility for.
There is contemporaneous evidence as to the steps that were taken by Dare to provide cover for D2’s absence from the Crude Oil desk following his resignation. That evidence does not support the proposition that Dare would not have wished D2 to return to trading, and at the very least to derisk his positions on the desk.
As D2 was not put on “Garden Leave”, there is no time to deduct from the post-termination restraints, if they are enforceable, pursuant to clause 13(d). The fact that D2 did not work at all for Dare during the notice period – and so the benefit that Dare actually gained from his absence - may be relevant, however, to whether the Court should refuse to enforce the post-termination restraints.
Was D1 genuinely sick and unable to work?
The general legal position is that where there is medical evidence to support an employee’s sickness absence such as a doctor’s sick or fit note, an employer ought not to go behind this, and neither should the Court, without contradictory medical evidence: see Merseyrail Electrics 2002 Ltd v Taylor (Employment Appeal Tribunal, 18 May 2007), referring also to Teinaz v Wandsworth London Borough Council [2002] ICR 1471.
In the instant case, the contemporaneous evidence from the medical practitioners who were treating D1 is that, in their opinion, he was genuinely sick and unable to work at all for Dare for all of the period following his resignation and up until the termination of his employment. In my judgment, there is no proper basis to go behind those opinions.
Around the time of his resignation on 20 November 2023, D1 had an exacerbation of his chronic condition. It is clear that the situation improved by late December 2023, and was in complete remission by the end of January 2024. There was no further exacerbation of this condition from then until the termination of employment in July 2024. This is reflected in the contemporaneous notes, and confirmed by the medical experts who gave evidence to the Court.
As for whether D1 was able to work during the notice period, the medical experts with respect to the chronic condition noted that they were not Occupational Health physicians. Their joint opinion, however, was that when D1 was having his exacerbation in November and December 2023, “he would not have been able to do any work at all”. With respect to January 2024, they deferred to the position of the treating physician who had exercised his contemporaneous judgment on this issue and signed D1 off from work.
For the period from 1 February 2024 to 11 July 2024, the medical experts for the chronic condition agreed that D1 “would have been able to carry out some kind of work depending on the type of work and where it was carried out. He would not have been able to carry out any work that was likely to bring on stress sufficient to risk an exacerbation”. They said that it was “extremely unlikely” that D1 could have returned to work without suffering an exacerbation in the period from 1 February 2024 to the end of his employment.
It was appropriate for the medical experts to defer to E’s contemporaneous judgment on the issue as to what work D1 could have done for the period until the end of January 2024. E had met with D1 and was very familiar with his background as he had been consulted by D1 previously. Furthermore, doing work of any kind during January 2024 was, in my judgment, not realistic given D1’s other medical condition.
The advice of the other treating physician, F, was that D1 could not work at all for Dare during the remainder of the notice period. In her letter of 23 January 2024, F stated that “it is difficult to see how you can work at the moment”. The matters that she relied upon for her opinion pre-dated the assessment. They were already present when D1 had an earlier appointment towards the end of December 2023.
I consider that this other condition was genuine. The evidence before the Court is that D1 did manifest the various symptoms that lay behind F’s diagnosis and recommendation for him not to be at work. Although it is always possible for a patient to exaggerate and embellish their symptoms, in the hope that this will persuade a physician to make a particular diagnosis, I do not consider that that was the case here.
D1 had an expectation, based on his past experience, that he would not need to work at all during his notice period – that is, that he would have been able to enjoy a pure garden leave period and would be able to spend his time travelling, concentrating on his health and getting fit. That expectation was dashed by Mr Rahman’s instruction that D1 should continue working during his notice period, and should carry out certain tasks other than trading on the Propane and Naphtha desks. This led to or exacerbated the condition that F was asked to examine and treat D1 for.
In the circumstances, there was no “mistake of fact” as to whether D1 was genuinely sick and was unable to work. D1 was genuinely sick and unable to work, whatever Dare may have thought. Accordingly, there is no basis to a claim for unjust enrichment with respect to the payment of salary to D1 during his notice period.
I do not find that the symptoms described by D1 to F were inconsistent with his other conduct: his ‘nights out on the town’ with Mr Law, and his many foreign travels. D1’s difficulties were associated with the circumstances of Mr Rahman’s request to work his notice. That is why F was of the view that D1 could travel and seek to relax, but still be unfit for work.
I also do not consider that D1 pulled the wool over the eyes of F. Whilst she did not know all of the circumstances affecting D1, the key points that were conveyed to her were correct. As already explained, I also do not consider that F merely acted as an “advocate” for D1. The materials that the Court has seen reflect an experienced medical professional considering conscientiously the evidence presented to her and reaching a conclusion which is not a totally unreasonable one. F’s assessment was not undermined by the evidence of the medical experts who gave evidence to the Court.
I do not consider that this was all a ruse; merely part of a strategy devised by Mr Beckwith. Whilst I have no doubt that there was discussion between D1 and Mr Beckwith about his medical condition at least on a general level rather than the specific detail, and I also have no doubt that Mr Beckwith advised D1 to emphasise the medical condition in his communications with Mr Rahman, D1’s medical issues were genuine and he would have raised them with Mr Rahman in any event, and would have relied upon them for not returning to work for Dare.
Was D2 genuinely sick and unable to work?
The situation with D2 was very different. In my judgment, D2 was not genuinely sick and unable to work at all in the period following his resignation and up until the termination of his employment by Dare on 10 July 2024.
I have no doubt that D2 did suffer from a degree of stress and anxiety arising from his resignation from Dare and the correspondence from Mr Rahman, in particular, the intimation from Mr Rahman, and subsequently Dare’s solicitors, that losses made by Dare as a result of D2’s absence might give rise to a liability. Nevertheless, the evidence before the Court does not support the proposition that the stress and anxiety experienced by D2 was so severe that he was unable to work at all for Dare, including trading on the Crude desk and effecting a handover, following his resignation.
The only contemporaneous evidence to support D2’s inability to work were the fit notes signed by Dr Keane. They cannot be relied upon as evidence of what was actually occurring to D2. Whilst it is true that the first of these fit notes was signed by Dr Keane after a face-to-face meeting with D2, the Court is bound to be sceptical about the assessment that Dr Keane made about D2’s condition. First, Dr Keane was not D2’s regular GP. The assessment of D2 had actually been arranged by D2’s father, who apparently had a professional relationship with Dr Keane, as he was a pharmacist whose business was located near to the surgery where Dr Keane worked. Had D2 been genuinely suffering from such severe stress and anxiety that he was unable to work, it would be expected that he would obtain an appointment with and be assessed by a doctor at his usual General Practice. D2 said in evidence that he did not do this because he was aware that waiting times at his General Practice were long and he wanted an urgent appointment. I reject this evidence. There is no suggestion, for instance, that D2 even attempted to obtain an appointment with his General Practice before seeking his father’s help to obtain an appointment with Dr Keane. Far more likely is that D2 thought that Dr Keane would be more persuadable than his own GP as to the nature and extent of his condition.
Second, D2 had been primed by Mr Beckwith as to how to approach the consultation with the doctor, telling him “to lay on that you are not an anxious person but you are going through a very hostile situation with your employer who is threatening you with insane and fabricated financial losses”. It would not be surprising if Dr Keane took at face value what D2 was saying to him.
In any event, even if the initial fit note did reflect D2’s actual condition at that point in time, there is no explanation as to why D2 was unable to attend work in the period before he asked his father to obtain an appointment with Dr Keane, other than for the short period when he was on pre-booked annual leave which provided him with a genuine excuse for not working.
As for the period after the end of the first fit note, there was no further assessment by a medical practitioner to justify D2’s continued absence from work. Rather surprisingly, Dr Keane was content to sign D2 off work on further occasions without seeing him, or even speaking to him, and merely on the say-so of D2’s father. The absence of direct communications between D2 and Dr Keane renders these assessments unreliable.  Furthermore, at this point, there was no apparent “urgency” to explain why D2 could not have obtained an appointment with a doctor at his own General Practice on these subsequent occasions so that his own, rather than his father’s, doctors could assess him.
Moreover, if D2 was genuinely suffering from such stress that he could not work it would reasonably be expected that he would seek some form of counselling or therapy which might assist his return to work. D2 suggested in evidence that this was not something that was done within his family, and that he was not the kind of person to open up about his emotions or feelings. I acknowledge that there are individuals who are reluctant to seek formal support, but I do not accept that that is the reason why that was not done here by D2. Far more likely is that he was not as distressed and anxious as he subsequently described to the medical experts who examined him for the purposes of this litigation in September 2024, and so did not require any counselling or other treatment in any event.
The other contemporaneous materials do not provide any evidence to support D2’s alleged condition. To the contrary. They provide evidence of an individual who was functioning well. During his absence from Dare, D2 appeared to have no difficulty communicating with a wide range of individuals, including brokers and colleagues at Dare. In their communications, D2 appeared open, relaxed and often joking. D2 was able to engage very openly with personnel from Onyx, and even took preparatory steps in anticipation of working for Onyx. D2 improved his golf; D2 attended social gatherings and travelled with his family to Canada and Dubai among other places which he clearly enjoyed.
On 5 March 2024, D2 had a 10 minute WhatsApp exchange with a broker  called “Carlo”. D2 suggests meeting up. He tells Carlo that “Mate it’s tough to do anything with kids schedule . .. I feel like those instagram guys who don’t have a day job . . . Finally going to the gym ... Might actually be healthy for a little bit”. On 8 March 2024, for instance, he tells another broker  (Anthony) at 8:42pm that he is “Just out for drinks with some school parents lol”. In a WhatsApp exchange with Anthony, on 12 March 2024, they discuss meeting up one evening. D2 informs Anthony that he is “Trying golf”, followed by a laughing emoji.
On 19 June 2024, in a WhatsApp exchange with Seyd Anane, D2 was asked about how he was enjoying his garden leave. He said: “It's been good but also can't help feeling guilt of not working lol it's very wierd. I also have so much fomo away from the market. Crazy how long these non competes are these days.” No mention was made in this or any of D2’s other messages that were shared with the Court of any sickness or illness.
There was also no reference to any stress or difficulties in D2’s conversation with Mr Law at Oka on 8 May 2024. This was an unguarded conversation. They were both in similar positions, having resigned from Dare. If D2 was genuinely ill, it would surely have been referred to even in passing.
I find that sickness was a ruse used by D2 to avoid going back to work, at a time when he hoped that an agreement would be negotiated to allow him to start working for Onyx sooner than was contemplated by the contractual arrangements with Dare. D2 had, in my judgment, no intention of returning to work during his notice period. If he had any such intention, he would have taken up Mr Rahman’s repeated requests to attend an occupational health appointment, which may have facilitated a return to work. Whilst it is correct that D2 did eventually agree to attend such an appointment, that was only after a letter before claim had been sent by Dare. It is likely that his agreement to attend was tactical in the face of the threat of legal proceedings.
I consider that the ruse was part of a strategy devised by Mr Beckwith. Mr Beckwith did not give evidence orally to the Court. There was, however, ample material before the Court as to his mindset and way of working. It is abundantly clear from the written exchanges that Mr Beckwith acted as if he was ‘playing chess’ with Dare. The communications from Mr Rahman, and subsequently from Dare’s solicitors, were reasonable and fair, and yet Mr Beckwith treated them with total disdain. Whilst there is no specific mention of this ruse in the written exchanges that are available to the Court, there were several meetings and numerous telephone conversations with D2 in which this idea could have been discussed.  It may be that Mr Beckwith had been inspired in this regard by D1’s example; but the situations were entirely different. D1 had a chronic condition that was causing difficulties for him from shortly after his resignation. D2 had no underlying condition.
Contrary to the submission of Mr de Silva KC, it is clear from the correspondence with Mr Beckwith that D2 was not simply a passive participant in their exchanges. The correspondence demonstrates that D2 was reading and forming his own view as to what was being communicated by Mr Rahman (as for instance in D2’s less “optimistic” view of how things would develop on 14 February 2024, see paragraph 130 above) and as to what was being crafted by Mr Beckwith for him to send (as, for instance, was evidenced in their discussion about what to say to Mr Rahman on 23 February 2024: see paragraph 139 above). D2 was, however, relying on Mr Beckwith for strategy and the overall way in which he needed to deal with Dare. It was suggested by Mr de Silva KC that D2 did not say anything when Mr Beckwith made quite outrageous comments. I find that the lack of response was not indicative of D2 showing passivity. Rather, I find that D2 agreed with what was being said.
The Court was presented with expert evidence from Dr Hillman to say that at or shortly after his resignation D2 suffered from an Adjustment Disorder, defined in ICD-11 as “A maladaptive reaction to an identifiable psychosocial stressor or multiple stressors (e.g. divorce, illness or disability, socio-economic problems, conflicts at home or work) that usually emerges within a month of the stressor”. Dr Hillman considered that “avoidance” was a key symptom and that this avoidance behaviour was likely to have accounted for the lack of D2’s engagement with his employer, occupational health and the lack of pursuit of treatment.
Dr Hillman’s diagnosis was based on a review of D2’s medical history (which showed no history of mental illness) and an in-person assessment. It is clear, however, that Dr Hillman was not provided with the full details of D2’s situation and the circumstances surrounding the resignation and his future employment with Onyx.
D2 had told Dr Hillman that things at Dare were so bad that he was throwing away money – a substantial bonus - by leaving. D2 did not tell Dr Hillman about the indemnity from Onyx, and the substantial remuneration that he was being offered by Onyx which was designed in part to compensate D2 for giving up his bonus. D2 did not tell Dr Hillman that Mr Beckwith had told him what to say to Dr Keane, or that Dr Keane was not his normal doctor, or that he had obtained fit notes via his father. D2 did not tell Dr Hillman of the preparatory work that he had done for Onyx during the notice period.
In my judgment, had he been told the full story, Dr Hillman would have been far more sceptical of D2’s presentation and would not have concluded that there was a real barrier for D2 to return to work at Dare; that D2’s “avoidance” was not the result of a psychiatric condition.
Although D2 was not too ill to work, I do not find that the claim for unjust enrichment is made out such that D2 should give restitution of his base salary received during the course of his employment. The basis for the unjust enrichment claim, as set out in paragraph 80 of the Amended Particulars of Claim, is that the salary payments were made to D2 “under a mistake of fact, namely that [D2 was] too “sick” to work”. To satisfy the test of “mistake”, Dare needs to establish that, in spite of its doubts, it believed that it was more probable than not that the facts were otherwise than they in fact were: see Goff and Jones, The Law of Unjust Enrichment (10th ed, 2022) at paragraphs 9.24-9.25, referring to Marine Trade SA v Pioneer Freight Futures Co Ltd BVI [2009] EWHC 2656 (Comm). That is, Dare needs to establish that it believed that it was more probable than not that D2 was genuinely too sick to work in the period when it continued to pay his salary and employ him to 11 July 2024. In my judgment, Dare did not surmount that threshold.
In his evidence to the Court, Mr Rahman did not expressly state that he believed that D2 was too ill to work. To the contrary, Mr Rahman gave evidence as to the doubts that he harboured about D2’s assertions of sickness. Mr Rahman stated that he was “somewhat sceptical” of D2’s assertion of sickness. The assertion “came out of the blue” and “seemed very coincidental”. Mr Rahman stated that he believed that it was possible for an employee to get a sick note from a doctor with relative ease, although he did not expect his Senior Traders to do so. Mr Rahman stated that he had “no firm evidence that sickness was not the real reason for [D2’s] absence, but I certainly knew it was possible that the absence was for other reasons and that sickness was merely being used as a pretext in the hope that Dare would or could never challenge it”. The repeated requests for D2 to attend for an occupational health appointment also demonstrates real scepticism about him being unable to do any work.
Did D1 breach his contract/breach fiduciary duty?
Mr Goulding KC argued that D1 was obliged to turn up for work and perform the duties assigned to him unless he was genuinely unable to for reasons outside of his control. Reliance for this proposition is based on the unlawful deduction of wages case of Miles v Wakefield MDC [1987] AC 539, 552H, in which Lord Brightman stated that an employee is excused from normal duties, but is still entitled to be paid, if he is absent as a result of an “illness or otherwise unavoidable impediment”. Mr Goulding KC contended that an employee is not excused from normal duties where the impediment is avoidable, that is where the inability to work is caused by something in the employee’s control. That was not the case here.
D1’s reaction to Dare’s lawful instruction that he work during his notice period led to, or exacerbated, the illnesses from which D1 was suffering. Those illnesses cannot properly be regarded as self-induced. There is no suggestion that D1 wanted to be ill. Indeed, far from it. The evidence shows that he suffered considerably during the period of his illness.
The situation is analogous to that found in Merseyrail Electrics 2002 Ltd at [13]. The Employment Appeal Tribunal (per His Honour Judge Peter Clark) stated that “Even if [the employee] was feeling piqued at not getting her own way, if that led to stress which in turn caused her absence, then she was entitled to sick pay, provided there was no doubt about that causative link”.
I find, however, that D1 was in breach of contract in refusing to attend an Occupational Health assessment. The contract of employment provided at clause 10(e) that an employee could be required to undergo a medical examination by a medical practitioner appointed by Dare “at the reasonable request” of Dare. Mr Solomon KC argued that the direction to attend an occupational health referral was not reasonable. First, D1 genuinely believed that he was too sick to do any work. Second, D1 was under the care of senior medical practitioners who considered that he was too sick to work. Third, D1 considered that an Occupational Health appointment was unnecessary and might be unhelpful to his recovery. Fourth, D1 had justifiable concerns about whether Dare (and, in particular, Mr Rahman) would keep his medical information confidential.
Mr Solomon KC also argued that Dare did not really want D1 to attend a medical appointment because when he did consent to doing so Dare did not engage with D1 and one month later dismissed him. Mr Rahman had said that this was “too little too late”. I do not regard that explanation as meaning that the earlier requests for D1 to attend an appointment with occupational health were not genuine. The explanations provided by D1 for his sickness absence were rather minimal, and Dare had good reason to want to know more, and also to see what if any measures could be taken to facilitate a return to work. Dare’s concerns about the lack of information would have no doubt increased following D2’s notification that he was also not able to work his notice as a result of illness.
D1 did not agree to the various requests until 11 June 2024, when his solicitors conveyed his agreement to attend an Occupational Health appointment. This breach may not sound in anything other than nominal damages, but that will be a matter for a quantum hearing.
I do not consider that D1 breached his contract in any other way. Dare’s Sickness Absence Policy – and, in particular, an obligation to complete a time-off request on Dare’s system known as “HiBob” – was not contractual. The policy is not specifically incorporated into the contract of employment by reference. To the contrary, clause 20 of the contract of employment states that Dare’s policies are “not contractually binding”. It can also be seen that the contract of employment contains a detailed set of requirements for the employee in case of “Sick Leave”. There is no indication that any of these terms were breached.
There is no direct evidence that D1 engaged in any unlawful competitive activity during his notice period, and it cannot be inferred from the evidence. There is no evidence that D1 performed any preparatory work for Onyx. There is no evidence that D1 sought to solicit brokers to move their business away from Dare. There is no evidence that D1 sought to solicit employees of Dare to resign their employment. The resignation of D2, and of others (including Mr Law) do not appear to have been as a result of D1 telling them of his move to Onyx, let alone him encouraging them to resign to do the same. There is no evidence that D1 talked to personnel at Onyx about other employees who they might be interested in approaching.
Mr Rahman told the Court that D1’s resignation led to numerous other employees resigning. Mr Rahman’s belief was that D1’s resignation had caused destabilisation of the workforce at Dare, referring in particular to a wave of resignations that took place over Easter 2024, including 2 individuals (Luke Fifield and Daniel Golizadeh) who reported to D1; and a further wave of resignations between 4 April and 8 May 2024. Several of those who resigned did not return to work on grounds of sickness. Mr Rahman said in evidence that “It seems impossible to me that this unprecedented wave of resignations was a coincidence, or unrelated to the fact that three of Dare’s biggest figures simply went AWOL from the business. I believe that these resignations were caused, at least in part, by the destabilization caused by Mr Soliman and Mr Hikmet (and Mr Law) suddenly vanishing”.
There is no evidence available to the Court to support this proposition. Mr Rahman accepted in cross-examination that none of the departing employees  had told him that D1 was the reason for their departure. Rather, they gave other reasons, including their own mental health. In any event, even if D1’s resignation did influence the decision of other Dare staff to resign that would not amount to a breach of contract by D1; he was entitled to resign, even if it had an impact on the decision of other employees.
D1 did not inform Dare that he was moving to Onyx. I do not find that this in itself was a breach of contract. Clause 13(h) of the contract of employment provides that: “If Employee applies for or is otherwise offered employment or an engagement, appointment, or consultancy at any time during his employment, Employee will immediately inform the Company of such offer of employment or engagement and Employee will provide a copy of this paragraph 13 to the person or entity that he has applied to or has made such offer.” This provision obliges the departing employee to inform Dare of “such offer of employment”. I construe that to refer to the fact that an offer of employment has been made to the employee. There is no reference to the identity of the offeror to be notified to Dare and, contrary to Dare’s submissions, I do not consider that it is implicit in the reference to “such offer”. There is no necessary reason why Dare requires to know the identity of the employer and, even if it did, it would have to be balanced against the employee’s desire to keep that matter to himself. The primary purpose of the contractual obligation is that the employee informs the future employer of the post-termination restraints.
This construction is fortified by the fact that Dare’s Articles of Association, adopted in July 2023, do specifically require the identity of the offeror to be notified to Dare:
“During each Growth Shareholder's employment and for 12 months thereafter, the Growth Shareholder will immediately report to the Company or any director of the Company or any Group Company any Offer of work or employment made by a competitor (or potential competitor) of the Company or any Group Company. The report will include (without limitation) the identity of the offeror, the date of the Offer and the terms of the Offer”.
(Emphasis added). This demonstrates how easy it would be to draft such a clause if that was the objective intention of the parties.
It is not possible, in my judgment, for Dare to achieve the same result via clause 3(c)(7) – a provision that obliged D1 to keep Dare “fully informed of his conduct”. Accepting an offer of employment cannot sensibly be regarded as “conduct” for the purposes of this provision.
Furthermore, Dare cannot achieve the same result by invoking the implied duty of good faith and fidelity. This was not a “team move” type case, and D1 was not privy to the conversations that, for instance, D2 was having with Dare about his move to Onyx: c.f. Kynixa Ltd v Hynes [2008] EWHC 1495 (QB) at [283].
I also do not consider that D1 breached his contract by colluding with Onyx. Dare’s argument with respect to collusion is encapsulated in their pleading at paragraph 60A of the Amended Particulars of Claim. That is:
“D1 agreed a strategy with Mr Beckwith and/or Onyx/Axis to secure his early release from his employment at Dare;
D1 disclosed his resignation and post-resignation correspondence, and/or its contents, with Mr Rahman to Mr Beckwith and/or Onyx/Axis;
Mr Beckwith and/or Onyx/Axis also assisted D1 in drafting his responses to Mr Rahman and/or otherwise assisted D1 in avoiding work during his notice period and/or seeking to avoid his obligations under the post-termination covenants;
D1 also acted in accordance with the instructions and/or advice of Mr Beckwith and/or Onyx/Axis in respect of the same; and/or
D1 did the foregoing in the interests of himself and/or Onyx/Axis and not in, or contrary to, the interests of Dare”.
I have no doubt that D1 discussed a strategy with Mr Beckwith about how he could secure his early release from Dare’s employment, disclosed correspondence with Onyx, had some assistance from Mr Beckwith in drafting responses to Mr Rahman, and followed advice that Mr Beckwith gave him. Although much of the correspondence between D1 and Mr Beckwith has not been disclosed on the basis of legal professional privilege as lawyers were present and may well have advised during their meetings, conversations and other communications, it is possible to infer that Mr Beckwith – who was not a lawyer, and whose advice would not be protected by privilege – gave advice to D1 which he followed. As an example, D1 withdrew from Dare’s WhatsApp groups on 21 February 2024. Although D1 claimed that he could not recall discussing this with Mr Beckwith, his withdrawal took place after he had had a 36 minute conversation with Mr Beckwith. I cannot accept that this was a mere coincidence.
However, as already explained, the illnesses that D1 were suffering from were genuine, and they provided him with a lawful excuse for not working for Dare during the notice period, and for disconnecting from work communications. Whilst I find that Mr Beckwith advised D1 to use his sickness as an excuse for not working, and that Mr Beckwith regarded that as the centrepiece of a strategy to secure D1’s early release from Dare’s employment, the sickness was genuine and so the reality of the situation coincided with Mr Beckwith’s strategy.
Furthermore, the fact that indemnities were signed with Onyx did not, in my judgment, explain D1’s behaviour. They may have provided him with some comfort that he would be financially protected if a claim was brought against him by Dare, and they may have fortified the approach that was taken by him, but that approach was one which I consider he would have taken in any event.
In the circumstances, I do not find that D1’s conduct was unlawful collusion in breach of the duty of fidelity, when it was premised on something that was genuine.
As for whether D1 breached a fiduciary duty owed to Dare, I conclude that he did not. A number of factors have been identified as being relevant to whether the relationship and contractual duties and responsibilities give rise to fiduciary obligations:
The seniority of the employee, and the extent of responsibility for, and autonomy in relation to, management of the employer’s business or a part of that business.
The degree of autonomy afforded the employee, or conversely control exercised by the employer, in relation to specific obligations or relationships relevant to the case (as in the case of a salesperson responsible for passing back information as to business opportunities).
Whether the employee is entrusted with or assumes control over relevant tangible or intangible property (including in particular confidential information) and is relied upon to deal with it for the benefit of the employer and/or only for authorised purposes.
Whether the employee is entrusted with relevant initiatives and responsibilities, such as negotiation of a contract, in which he is required to act solely in the interests of the employer to procure the best terms for the employer.
Whether the nature of the employee’s role or responsibilities (whether by virtue of the contract or assumed in practice), such as his influence over the placing of relevant orders, is such as to leave the employer vulnerable to abuse unless the employee acts solely in the best interest of the employer.
The nature of the breach. A fiduciary obligation will more readily be found in the case of a bribe or secret commission.
See Selwyn Bloch QC and Kate Brearley, Employment Covenants and Confidential Information (4th ed. 2018), at paragraph 4.55.
When he was trading with Dare’s capital, D1 owed Dare fiduciary obligations. Although he was not part of the senior management of Dare, and had no responsibility for the strategic direction of the business or even for recruitment decisions, as head of the Propane and Naphtha desk D1 had considerable autonomy with respect to the making of trades. He was also entrusted with Dare’s confidential information and permitted to exploit it for Dare’s benefit. Nevertheless, the allegations against D1 do not involve his trading for Dare; rather, they are concerned with the time after he had handed in his notice and was not trading for Dare. Furthermore, the allegations against D1 do not include breach of confidence. In those circumstances, fiduciary obligations do not arise and so no breach of fiduciary duty is made out against D1.
Did D2 breach his contract/breach fiduciary duty?
D2 did breach his contract with Dare. He failed to turn up for work in circumstances where he did not have a genuine sickness preventing him from doing so. After resigning from Dare on 13 February 2024, D2 had not been placed on “Garden Leave” by Dare. D2 had been asked to return to work and carry on trading on the Crude desk. I find that this request was a genuine one. D2 did not have a lawful excuse for his non-attendance or not working at all for Dare during his notice period.
I am not asked, at this hearing, to consider questions of quantum. It seems to me that there may be various heads of loss available to Dare to pursue, such as loss of profits on the Crude Oil Desk as a result of D2’s absence, or lost management time. The materials that I have seen indicate that, at least in the first month after D2’s departure, the Crude Oil Desk did make a loss, and there is some evidence that losses were suffered thereafter: see paragraph 117 above. Nevertheless, the evidence is not comprehensive. Mr de Silva KC contended that this showed that Dare had not suffered any actual loss. That may be right, but it may be that evidence of loss was not produced by Dare as the speedy trial was for liability only.
Mr de Silva KC also contended that the evidence shows that the Crude team were trading actively, positively and seemingly successfully after D2’s resignation. That also may be right, although the positive comments from Mr Rahman to the team that Mr de Silva KC relied upon may have simply been to encourage and motivate staff with positive messages, when the reality of what was actually taking place on the “pnl” was different.
At this stage of the proceedings, I am unable to make any findings as to whether any loss was actually made on the Crude desk. It is clear, however, that management time was plainly diverted to deal with D2’s absence. This may sound in damages. In any event, even if no actual loss was sustained by Dare, they would be entitled to nominal damages for D2’s failure to comply with the reasonable instruction and to work his notice.
Mr de Silva KC has also pointed to the evidence that Mr Khan was recruited, submitting that he was a replacement for D2. Again, that is not an issue for me to determine at a liability trial. It would go to the question of quantum, where the Court will need to decide if Mr Khan’s recruitment staunched, or even reversed, the loss that Dare suffered as a result of D2’s failure to work during his notice period, and/or whether Dare acted reasonably to mitigate any loss.
It is also clear that D2 was in breach of the duty of fidelity in that he took preparatory steps to compete with Dare during the course of his notice period. Unlike D1 who did not have significant dealings with Onyx following his resignation, D2 had a number of significant dealings with Onyx which were not simply meeting and greeting the people who he was going to work for. D2 started to work with Onyx to prepare the layout of his pricing sheet; D2 also started to work with Onyx to discuss what he wanted to do with “Eagle”, Onyx’s energy trading and risk management system.
On his visit to Dubai, D2 visited Onyx’s premises and reported back his view about the size of the office. D2 also offered to help Onyx find different offices in Dubai. I do not find that what D2 did can properly be regarded as assisting Onyx to find permanent premises in Dubai, and so this did not constitute a breach of contract.
D2 was in breach of contract, however, in that he provided Mr Kayaam with information about the Crude Desk’s “pnl”, and other items that fed into his remuneration package at Dare, such as the rebates, fees, and administration costs paid by his desk. This information was confidential to Dare and D2 did not have permission to share it with a competitor. In passing on this information, D2 was not using his best efforts to promote or protect the interests of Dare, thereby contravening clause 3(c)(1) of his contract of employment, and was in breach of the duty of fidelity.
D2 also informed Mr Beckwith about the management and performance of Dare’s Crude desk, which was information that was confidential to Dare and might be useful to a competitor. In this regard, I refer to D2 telling Mr Beckwith that Mr Afzali was managing fine in terms of de-risking the book (21 February 2024); that there were a certain number of people working on the desk (22 February 2024); that the book was up a certain amount when he left (23 February 2024); that the position was down by a specific amount a few days later (26 February 2024). In passing on this information, D2 was not using his best efforts to promote or protect the interests of Dare, thereby contravening clause 3(c)(1) of his contract of employment, and was in breach of the duty of fidelity.
D2 also discussed with Mr Kayaam the capabilities of Dare’s employees: this was referred to in the Oka conversation. In cross-examination, D2 stated that this was a reference to the four individuals who had worked on his desk at Dare. The very fact that D2 was giving information about Dare’s employees and their capabilities to a competitor was a breach of the duty of fidelity owed to his employer, and contravened clause 3(c)(1).
Nevertheless, I do not consider that D2 solicited, or encouraged, other Dare employees to join Onyx. There is no direct evidence of that in the materials that were before the Court, and it is not an inference that I can make from the evidence that I have seen and heard. The conversation at the Oka restaurant does contain references to other members of staff, but does not suggest that D2 had sought to encourage them to join him at Onyx or was likely to do so in the future. Indeed, when D2 was asked by Mr Kayaam as to whether any of the juniors working for Dare were “good”, he gave negative feedback about them. The references in the Oka conversation to other members of Dare’s staff did not provide evidence that D2 had had discussions with them about moving with him from Dare to Onyx.
As for encouraging Mr Law himself to join Onyx, I do not find that this is made out on the evidence. It is clear that Mr Law had already had conversations with Mr Kayaam from Onyx entirely independently of D2. Whilst D2 spoke very positively about Onyx in the conversation at Oka, he did not suggest that Mr Law join him there. Indeed, part of their conversation involved the difficulties that Mr Law might face if he was to join, or seek to join, Onyx given the trading strategies that he had previously been involved in at Dare and which had caused difficulties with the regulators in the United States.
I also find that D2 breached his contract, and in particular the duty of fidelity, by meeting with a number of brokers during the course of his notice period: Carlo Peccioli, Marco Courtney, Jeremy Abihssira, Luke Oldershaw, Anthony Georgiou, Will Brentnall, Marlon Lindsey, Jeremy Chamberlain and Joshua Conners. Whilst I accept that the meetings were primarily for social purposes, as the persons with whom D2 met were longstanding friends of his, I have no doubt that D2 told them that he was leaving Dare and moving to Onyx. Whilst there is no support for the allegation that D2 encouraged the brokers not to do business, or to do less business, with Dare, his meetings with the brokers were in part designed to, and would have had the effect of, preserving his relationship with the brokers for the purpose of doing business with them again in the future. In other words, D2 was keeping warm his business relationship with the brokers.
D2 was also in breach of his contract of employment by failing to inform Dare of his wrongdoing, in contravention of clause 3(c)(6). On the other hand, D2 was not in breach of contract for failing to inform Dare that he was moving to Onyx, for the same reasons as I have given above for D1. For the same reasons as I have found above with respect to D1, I do not consider that D2 breached his contract by destabilising the workforce.
As for the allegation of breach of fiduciary duty, the same analysis applies to D2 as to D1. When he was trading with Dare’s capital as Head of the Crude Oil desk, D2 would have been in a fiduciary relationship. The allegations against D2 involve the period when he was not trading and so, generally speaking, he owed no fiduciary duties to Dare. The exception however is the misuse of Dare’s confidential information. This information was entrusted to D2 for Dare’s benefit only, and he was not entitled to share that information with a competitor. To that extent, therefore, D2 was in breach of fiduciary duty. By disclosing confidential information to Onyx, D2 had (i) failed to act in good faith, exclusively in the best interests of Dare and not in his own; (ii) placed himself in a position where his duties to Dare conflicted with his own personal interests.
Should the Court grant an injunction to enforce the non-competition covenant?
I do not refuse to grant an injunction for enforcement of the post-termination restraints on the basis that damages would be an adequate remedy for Dare. If either of the Defendants had gone to work for Onyx straight after their termination of employment, it would not have been possible for the Court to assess what damages had been sustained as a result.
I refuse to exercise my discretion, however, to grant Dare injunctive relief against D1. This is not because granting the relief will cause D1 hardship, or would lead to an unconscionable or oppressive outcome. D1 would continue to receive a base salary during the restraint period, his job with Onyx will still be available and his skills are unlikely to atrophy. I refuse relief because, in substance, Dare has already enjoyed protection against competition for more than 12 months.
From 20 November 2023 to 10 July 2024, Dare enjoyed protection akin to what it would have enjoyed had D1 been asked not to carry out any work. During that period, D1 did not access or use confidential information and he has not solicited employees to move over to Onyx, nor has D1 done any work for Onyx or prepared to compete against Dare. From 10 July 2024 until the date of judgment (a period of more than 6 months), Dare has had the benefit of undertakings akin to the non-competition covenant.
I appreciate that Dare did not receive the benefit of a handover from D1, but this was a result of D1’s sickness absence, which I have found was genuinely based. As a result, Dare could not reasonably have expected to benefit from D1’s services during this period.
As against D2, I consider that the non-competition covenant should be enforced for the period of 12 months following his termination: that is, until 10 July 2025. As already explained, the non-competition restraint is enforceable. There is no basis to deduct from the 12 month period any time spent on Garden Leave, as D2 was never placed on Garden Leave by Dare.
Mr de Silva KC contended that the Court has discretion as to whether to grant an injunction to enforce the post-termination restraints and could enforce only part of the term, as reflected in Underhill LJ’s judgment in Sunrise Brokers at [49] that there was no reason in principle why the exercise of the Court’s  discretion as to whether to grant an injunction to enforce a post-termination restraint must be “all-or-nothing”. (I note in this regard that Mr Solomon KC made the contrary argument, that a Court could not enforce a shorter period of restraint than the contractual entitlement. Mr Solomon KC contends that the covenant either applies for the entire period of restraint as contracted for, or not at all. The Court cannot rewrite the length of the covenant). In essence, Mr de Silva KC submitted that as D2 had been out of the market since 14 February 2024, so an injunction to enforce the post-termination restraints should be limited to 14 February 2025.
I disagree. I do not consider that an injunction should be refused on account of the fact that D2 was absent from work for the period from 13 February 2024 to 10 July 2024, on the basis that Dare has been provided with the protection that it would be expected to enjoy during the post-termination restraint period. However, as set out in my findings above, Dare did not enjoy that protection. First, D2 carried out preparatory work for Onyx during the notice period; D2 disclosed confidential information to Onyx; and D2 continued to meet with brokers. Second, Dare did not have the benefit of any handover from D2, which was what he was asked to do by Mr Rahman.
I have also found that D2’s absence from work was not genuinely due to sickness. Rather, it was a deliberate refusal to comply with the terms of his contract of employment, pursuant to which Dare was entitled to request D2 to work his notice. It would, in my judgment, be wrong to refuse relief in these circumstances. D2 feigned sickness, using it as an excuse for not working when he knew that he was not ill and could work for Dare. In the circumstances, it would not be unconscionable or cause undue hardship to D2 if the full length of the restraints was applied to him. To hold otherwise would be to allow him to take advantage of his own wrongdoing.
Furthermore, there is no evidence that granting the relief will cause D2 any other hardship. He would continue to receive a base salary during the restraint period; his job with Onyx will still be available; and his skills are unlikely to atrophy.
In the circumstances, I do not need to decide whether or not it is open to the Court to grant an injunction to enforce only part of the contractual period of the post-termination restraint. In my judgment, the entire period the restraint should be enforced against D2.
Is Dare entitled to springboard relief against the Defendants?
The purpose of springboard relief is to put the parties on a level playing field, and to eliminate the head start that would otherwise have been obtained by the departing employee as a result of the breach of contract. In QBE Management Services Ltd, Haddon-Cave J asked at [284]: “how much of a march have the Defendants in this case, in fact, stolen on the Claimant as a result of their wrongdoing?”.
I do not consider that springboard relief should be granted against D1. As already explained, his failure to work during his notice period was not in itself a breach of contract, and so would not justify the grant of any injunctive relief. The refusal of D1 to attend an occupational health appointment would also not be a basis to justify injunctive relief: it did not provide D1 with any head-start over Dare.
The situation with respect to D2 is different. He engaged in competitive conduct during the notice period as discussed above, which included some preparatory steps in anticipation of his working for Onyx. This gave him a head-start over Dare which is not cancelled out by any extra protection that Dare has enjoyed as a result of the undertakings given to the deputy judge on 18 July 2024 and the period of notice. The head-start obtained by D2 from this competitive conduct is not substantial; springboard relief for a period of one month would be the appropriate measure.
I do not consider that any springboard relief should be granted in respect of D2’s refusal to work during his notice period. Counsel were not able to locate any authority to support the proposition that springboard relief was available in these circumstances. I am doubtful that the springboard doctrine could apply in these circumstances, as it is predicated on an employee taking an “unfair advantage” by his unlawful conduct. The main focus, therefore, is on the “actual advantage” gained by the wrongdoer, and the appropriate measure for the length of the springboard is the length of time that it would have taken the wrongdoer to obtain lawfully what he in fact achieved unlawfully, relative to the victim: see QBE Management Services Ltd at [284]-[285].
The advantages that Dare has identified as accruing to D2 as a result of his failing to work during the periods when he could have worked, are that (i) D2’s  employment would not have been brought to an early end, and he would not have been able to commence work for Onyx until 14 February 2026; and (ii) D2 will be able to start work for Onyx in a context in which Dare is weakened. I am doubtful as to whether these are the kinds of “unfair advantage” that the springboard doctrine should embrace. Nevertheless, even if they could in theory be treated as falling within the springboard doctrine, they do not justify injunctive relief on the present facts.
With respect to (i), this is far too speculative. It is not known why D2’s employment was actually brought to an early end, and it is certainly possible that termination would have taken place at or around the same time in any event. The decision to terminate D2 was one that Dare was entitled to make under the terms of the contract of employment. Dare has not advanced an argument that it was forced to terminate D2’s employment in July 2024, or at any time before 14 February 2025. Dare has not, for instance, contended that D2’s wrongdoing constituted a repudiatory breach which was accepted by the act of termination. Indeed, such an argument would be doomed to fail, given that the termination was made in accordance with the terms of the contract of employment as payment in lieu of notice was made to D2 and so would amount to an affirmation of the contract rather than an acceptance of breach.
Furthermore, it is speculative as to whether Dare would have allowed D2 to continue trading on the Crude Oil desk for the entirety of the notice period, in any event. The initial intention was for D2 to work on the Crude Oil desk for 6 months. It is possible that Mr Rahman would have had second thoughts about D2 working in that capacity for so long if D2 had returned to work. It is possible that “specified duties” or no duties would have been allocated to D2 in the period “immediately” before the termination of employment. If so, then this would have reduced the period of time for which the post-termination restraint applied and D2 would have been able to commence work for Onyx at an earlier date than 14 February 2026.
As for (ii), this is in essence another way of describing the disadvantages caused to the company as result of D2’s failure to work during the notice period which form part of the quantum assessment that the Court will need to carry out. That is, (i) losses on the Crude Oil desk; (ii) no handover, leading to disarray on the Crude Oil desk; (iii) no assistance in the recruitment or training of replacements; (iv) precarious relationships with and knowledge of brokers; (v) wider disruption and opportunity costs. Given that D2 has the benefit of an indemnity from Onyx, and there is no suggestion that Onyx would not be able to meet its obligations under the indemnity, it is clear that damages would be an adequate remedy and so a springboard injunction would not be appropriate.
Conclusion
In conclusion, therefore, I refuse any injunctive relief against D1, but find that he breached his contract of employment in not agreeing to Dare’s request to attend an Occupational Health appointment until June 2024.
I find that D2 has breached his contract of employment in a number of ways, and has also breached his fiduciary duty to Dare. I grant injunctive relief against D2: he is ordered to comply with the non-competition restraint until 11 July 2025, and is restrained for a further period of one month (that is, until 11 August 2025) from taking up employment with Onyx.
I dismiss the claims for unjust enrichment against both Defendants.
(Footnote reference from: 1)  Strictly speaking, employment may be with another entity within the Onyx Group of companies – Axis Ltd. In this judgment, I will refer generically to Onyx whenever I am discussing a company within the Onyx Group, including Axis Ltd.
(Footnote reference from: 2)  I understand that the case has settled. I have not been notified of the terms of any settlement agreement. The fact of settlement has no bearing on the issues that I am asked to determine in these proceedings.
(Footnote reference from: 3)  Among the many other calls between D1 and Mr Beckwith were the following: 11 January 2024 (16 minutes+), 15 January 2024 (15 minutes+); 19 January 2024 (18 minutes+); 22 January 2024 (45 minutes+); 24 January 2024 (one call for just under 15 minutes, and another for 9 minutes+); 26 January 2024 (26 minutes+); 1 February 2024 (32 minutes+); 6 February 2024 (8 minutes+); 8 February 2024 (5 minutes+); 13 February 2024 (26 minutes+); 23 February 2024 (6 minutes+); 29 February 2024 (18 minutes+); 8 May 2024 (one call for 18 minutes, and then another call for 23 minutes+); 11 May 2024 (11 minutes).
(Footnote reference from: 4)  Other calls between D1 and Mr Kayaam were as follows: on 24 January 2024, D1 and Mr Kayaam had a WhatsApp call for more than 9 minutes; a call for more than 19 minutes on 25 January 2024; a call for more than 18 minutes on 1 February 2024; a call for more than 28 minutes on 20 February 2024; a call for more than 14 minutes on 28 February 2024; a call for more than 17 minutes on 28 March 2024; a call for more than 1 hour and 11 minutes on 3 April 2024. They also met up on 17 April 2024.

Appellant
-and-
REGISTRAR OF APPROVED DRIVING INSTRUCTORS
Respondent
Decision: The appeal is Dismissed. The Decision of the Respondent made  on 10 September 2024 is confirmed.
REASONS
This appeal was listed for determination on the papers only, with the agreement of the parties.
The Appellant appealed against a decision of the Respondent dated 10 September  2024, to refuse the Appellant’s application for a further, third, trainee driving instructor licence made on 8 August 2024. The decision of the Respondent was made, taking account of representations made by the Appellant, in writing, on 15 August 2024, namely, that if he were not to be granted a third trainee licence, he would have no income and had deliberately reduced the number of pupils he was teaching in order to better focus on where he needed to improve in order to become a better instructor that would help in him passing his Part 3 test; that he had failed a Part 3 test in February 2024, feeling pressured into taking the test at that time by his franchisee as soon as he had completed his additional 21 hours of PDI training, despite being ‘woefully unprepared’, a position with which his new trainer, it was submitted, agreed; that he had booked another attempt to pass the Part 3 test but remained on hold pending a test date being offered and had undertaken additional training, on the grounds that the Appellant had been granted two trainee licences, covering a period of 12 months in total, from 21 August 2023 to 22 August 2024, to gain sufficient expertise in driving instruction to pass a Part 3 test, a time period that, it was submitted, was more than adequate; that it was not the intention of Parliament that a trainee licence be issued for however long it might take a candidate to become an ADI; that the trainee licence system must not be allowed to become an alternative to registration as a fully-qualified ADI; that refusal of the Appellant’s application did not prevent him undertaking another Part 3 test (subject to there being a maximum permitted number of attempts); that a trainee licence was not required to undertake a Part 3 test and that the Appellant’s existing second trainee licence remained valid until determination of this appeal (as his application for a third trainee licence had been made before the expiry of his second trainee licence), providing him, in practical terms, with a total trainee licence period of more than 18 months.
The Appellant submitted an appeal on 22 September 2024 against the Respondent’s said decision on the following grounds in addition to his written representations in response to the Respondent’s intention to refuse his application for a third trainee licence:
that the Respondent was incorrect to assert that he was using trainee licences for financial gain (but did not elaborate further in support of that contention);
that since failing his first attempt to pass his Part 3 test, he had reduced the number of students he taught each week to focus on the feedback he had received and to work hard to improve, thereby cutting his weekly income by 50%;
that he had purchased additional training and video training;
that driving instruction was his job and only by holding a trainee licence could he ‘get by’;
that without a third trainee licence, he would still have weekly franchise and fuel costs that he could not afford unless he got another job that would be detrimental to his learning
that he had a second Part 3 test booked for November 2024;
that due to the waiting time to attempt another Part3 test, his trainer would only grant him tuition opportunity of 5 hours per week and, therefore, it was likely he would need to ‘buy’ more time;
The Respondent, in their Response dated 21 November 2024, submitted, in addition, that the Appellant did appear to be using trainee licences as a source of income; that he had failed a Part 3 test on one occasion (6 February 2024), but that the Respondent had cancelled two other dates where the Appellant was to attempt again to pass the Part 3 test (5 February 2024 and 19 November 2024), but that a second date had been booked for 4 February 2025; that the Appellant, if he wished to gain further experience, could undertake a training course, or study or practice with an ADI or provide unpaid tuition, pointing out that precedent existed whereby applicants succeeded in becoming registered as fully-qualified ADIs not having held any trainee licence.
Again, the purpose of a trainee licence, that is, of six months’ duration, is to allow an ADI applicant the opportunity of gaining practical experience in driving tuition in  order to reach the required standard to pass a Part 3 test and, thereby, become registered as a fully-qualified ADI and it is not necessary to hold a trainee licence in order to undertake a Part 3 test. It must be emphasised that the Appellant in this case had, in practical terms, the benefit of a trainee licence for more than 18 months.
This appeal concerns a decision of the Respondent to refuse the Appellant’s application for a further, third, ADI trainee licence. The powers of the Tribunal in determining this appeal are set out ins.131 of the Road Traffic Act 1988 (‘the Act’). In determining the appeal, the Tribunal may make such order as it thinks fit, standing in the shoes of the Respondent, considering the decision afresh on the evidence available to it, giving appropriate weight to the Respondent’s reasons for their decision. Theburden of proof in satisfying the Tribunal that the Respondent’s decision was wrong rests with theAppellant.
The essential basis of the Respondent’s decision was that the Appellant had been provided, under two trainee licences (albeit, in practical terms, he had the benefit of a trainee licence for almost 18 months) that was more than adequate time to gain sufficient experience to pass his Part 3 test.
An appeal to this Tribunal against the Respondent’s decision proceeds as an appeal by way ofre-hearing, that is, the Tribunal makes a fresh decision on the evidence before it. The Tribunal must givesuch weight as it considers appropriate to the Respondent’s reasons for its decision as the Respondent is the regulatory authority tasked by Parliament with making such decisions. The Tribunal does not conduct a proceduralreview of the Respondent’s decision-making process.
In reaching my decision I have taken into account all of the evidence and submissions received, written and oral, and considered all of the circumstances relevant to this appeal.
There was little or no dispute as to the material facts of this case.
Accordingly, the appeal isdismissed.

.............................
MRS JUSTICE HILL
Mrs Justice Hill:
Introduction
This is a judicial determination on the papers, but where it is appropriate to give reasons by way of a short judgment. It addresses the issue of where this claim should be administered and determined.
The procedural history
By a claim issued on 28 November 2024 the Claimant, a limited company operating petrol stations and retail stores under a franchise with the Co-Operative Group, seeks judicial review of the Defendant’s decision dated 28 August 2024 revoking the Claimant’s licence to sponsor workers, obtained under the ‘Skilled Worker’ route.
The Claimant filed the claim in London. In answer to question 4.6 on the claim form, “Have you issued this claim in the region with which you have the closest connection?” the Claimant answered “Yes”. No further reasons were given for wanting the claim to be dealt with in that region.
On 29 November 2024 a minded to transfer order (“MTTO”) was made. This is a mechanism by which the Court invites and considers the views of the parties before any final decision is made to transfer the claim: see the Administrative Court Judicial Review Guide 2024 at paragraph 7.7.5. The MTTO was made by Martin Lee, Administrative Court Lawyer, in the exercise of powers delegated by the President of the Queen’s Bench Division under CPR 54.1A; see also the Administrative Court Judicial Review Guide 2024 at paragraph 13.4.5.10.
The MTTO recorded that Mr Lee was minded to transfer the case to the Administrative Court in the North-Eastern region to be administered and determined at the Leeds Combined Court Centre in light of the following:
“Although the claimant has ticked in section 4, N461 that the claim has been filed in a region with which the claimant has the closest connection that does not appear to be accurate: the claimant is in Leeds and no reasons have been given for filing other than in the NE region. The transfer of the case will ensure efficient use of Court resources and ensure that the London region is not overburdened”.
Mr Lee also cited R (Thakor, aka Parmar) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2022] EWHC 2556 (Admin). There, Fordham J transferred a claim for judicial review relating to decision of the Secretary of State refusing the Claimant’s further asylum and human rights submissions from London to Leeds.
The MTTO gave the parties liberty to indicate opposition to transfer by way of written submissions within 7 days. The parties provided submissions on 5 and 6 December 2024.
The legal framework
CPR PD 54C is intended to facilitate access to justice by enabling cases to be administered and determined in the most appropriate location: paragraph 1.1. It explains that the administration of the Administrative Court is organised by geographical area; and that, in addition to the central Administrative Court Office at the Royal Courts of Justice in London, there are Administrative Court Offices in Birmingham, Cardiff, Leeds and Manchester. Claims on the North-Eastern Circuit are administered from (and should be filed in) Leeds and claims on the Northern Circuit are administered from (and should be filed in) Manchester: paragraph 1.2(1).
The Administrative Court applies the principle that “where a claim has a specific connection to a region (by subject matter, location of the claimant or defendant or otherwise) it should, if at all possible, be administered and determined in that region”: paragraph 1.2(2).
PD 54C makes provision for certain “excepted classes of claim” at paragraph 3.1. In all other cases, proceedings should be commenced “at the Administrative Court office for the region with which the claim is most closely connected, having regard to the subject matter of the claim, the location of the claimant, or the defendant, or otherwise”: paragraph 2.1.
Paragraph 2.5 reiterates the “general expectation” that “proceedings will be administered and determined in the region with which the claim has the closest connection”. This will be determined “having regard to the subject matter of the claim, the region in which the claimant resides and the region in which the defendant or any relevant office or department of the defendant is based”. In addition, the court may consider any or all other relevant circumstances including certain listed factors. (Footnote: 1)

The Claimant has asked that the claim remain in London because both the solicitors and barristers acting for the Claimant are based in London, such that a hearing in London would significantly reduce travel time and associated costs for the legal representatives, ensuring the efficient conduct of the proceedings. Reliance is placed on paragraph 2.5(b) and (i) of PD 54C.
The Defendant has not opposed transfer, indicating that she adopts a neutral position on the issue.
However, the factors set out in paragraphs 2.1 and 2.5 show that the region with which the claim is “most closely connected” is the North-Eastern region.
This is the “region in which the claimant resides” in that the Claimant’s business address as given at section 1 of the claim form is in Leeds. According to the statement of facts and grounds at [4], the Claimant initially operated at two sites known as Orchard and Otley Road and now has three further branches in Cathill, Girlington and Elford Grove. All these locations appear to be within an hour’s drive of Leeds.
The “subject matter of the claim” relates to the Claimant’s staff at the Cathill branch: statement of facts and grounds at [5].
As to the “region in which the defendant or any relevant office or department of the defendant is based”, although the Defendant was served in London, it has offices around the country. The decision under challenge was made by a decision-maker based in Sheffield: see pp.38-52 of the Claimant’s bundle.
Against this starting point is the Claimant’s expressed desire for the claim to remain in London because it has chosen to instruct lawyers in London.
In respect of PD 54C, paragraph 2.5(b), I accept that travel between London and Leeds will be needed if the Claimant retains the same lawyers and there are cost and time implications to consider. However, travel between London and Leeds can be done with ease, and without requiring an overnight stay for a one-day hearing. As the Claimant is based in Leeds their own travel time and costs would be reduced by the claim being heard in Leeds.
Moreover, as Fordham J highlighted in R (Airedale Chemical Company Ltd) v HMRC [2022] EWHC 2937 (Admin) at [3], the parties have “decision-making autonomy” as to which lawyers to instruct. As he said in Thakor at [2], instructing London counsel “ought not…normally ‘drive’ a London choice of venue becoming self-fulfilling”.
The Defendant has not yet instructed counsel: see the Acknowledgment of Service, section 6.
Under paragraph 2.5(c), Leeds has video-link hearing facilities should they be needed.
All these factors point strongly in favour of the claim, if at all possible, being administered and determined in the North-Eastern region and the “general expectation” that that would occur, given the terms of PD 54C, paragraphs 1.2(2) and 2.5.
This is a claim that can be administered and determined in the North-Eastern region. The regional Administrative Court has a team of ticketed specialist judges as well as visiting High Court Judges who sit in the region each court term.
Conclusion
For all these reasons, I have concluded that this claim should be transferred to the North-Eastern region to be administered and determined in Leeds.
(Footnote reference from: 1)  These are: “(a) any reason expressed by any party for preferring a particular venue; (b) the ease and cost of travel to a hearing; (c) the availability and suitability of alternative means of attending a hearing (for example, by video-link); (d) the extent and nature of any public interest that the proceedings be heard in any particular locality; (e) the time within which it is appropriate for the proceedings to be determined; (f) whether it is desirable to administer or determine the claim in another region in the light of the volume of claims issued at, and the capacity, resources and workload of, the court at which it is issued; (g) whether the claim raises issues sufficiently similar to those in another outstanding claim to make it desirable that it should be determined together with, or immediately following, that other claim; (h) whether the claim raises devolution issues and for that reason whether it should more appropriately be determined in London or Cardiff; and (i) the region in which the legal representative[s] of the parties are based.”

and
INFORMATION COMMISSIONER
Respondent
Decision: The appeal is struck out.
REASONS
On 14 August 2024 the Appellant emailed the Tribunal stating that he wanted to appeal a decision of the Information Commissioner. On 22 August 2024 the Tribunal wrote to the Appellant asking him to provide a fully completed application form GRC1 and a copy of the decision challenged within 28 days. The Appellant did not comply with those directions.
On 1 October 2024 a Senior Legal Officer directed the Appellant to provide a fully completed application form GRC1 and a copy of the decision to the Tribunal by no later than 17 October 2024. The direction warned the Appellant that failure to comply could lead to the Tribunal striking out the appeal without further direction, pursuant to Rule 8(3)(a) of The Tribunal Procedure (First-tier Tribunal) (General Regulatory Chamber) Rules 2009.
The directions were sent to the Appellant by email on 1 October 2024. He responded later the same day to say he would respond within the deadline. However, he did not comply with the directions.
I am satisfied that the Appellant has had a fair opportunity to comply with the directions of 1 October 2024 but has failed to do so.
The appeal is struck out under Rule 8(3)(a).

DISTRICT JUDGE DODSWORTH
BETWEEN:
KEITH MORRIS
CLAIMANT
- and -
WILLIAM SIMON WILLIAMS
DEFENDANT
Legal Representation
Mr David Morris (Solicitor), on behalf of the Claimant
Mr Paul Higgins (Counsel) on behalf of the Defendant
JUDGMENT
This judgment is handed down by release to the National Archives and circulation to the parties by email at 10.00 am on 5 February 2025
District Judge Dodsworth:
The Claimant in this matter, Mr Keith Morris, was represented before me today by his solicitor, Mr David Morris. The Defendant, Mr William Simon Williams, was represented by counsel, Mr Paul Higgins, instructed by Horwich Farrelly Limited.
The Claimant has brought proceedings seeking to recover damages for personal injuries he says he sustained when he was involved in a road traffic accident which took place as long ago as 20 July 2018. The Claimant was riding a motorcycle which was hit by a vehicle being driven by the Defendant.
It is not in dispute that the accident occurred as a result of the Defendant’s negligence and that the Claimant suffered some injuries. But, by way of an amended defence dated 6 April 2023, the Defendant made clear that he was running a case of fundamental dishonesty. The Defendant says that the Claimant has seriously exaggerated the effect and extent of the injuries that he did sustain in the accident and relies, inter alia, on surveillance footage he has obtained of the Claimant going about a number of daily activities.
The matter came before me on 22 January 2025 for the hearing of an application made by the Defendant on 5 December 2024. That application sought orders compelling the Claimant to respond to a Part 18 request and that a letter dated 12 May 2023 written by the Claimant’s then solicitors, Minster Law, to the Defendant’s solicitors (“the Letter”) may be adduced as evidence despite being marked “Without Prejudice – save as to costs”. The application was supported by a witness statement from Mr Philip Melia, of the Defendant’s solicitors, dated 5 December 2024.
The Claimant chose not to file a witness statement in response to the application. At a very late stage his solicitor filed a document headed “Response to Defendant’s application”. This was a somewhat curious document being neither a witness statement nor a skeleton argument. It was neither signed nor dated. In so far as it (or Mr Morris’ oral submissions) sought to give evidence about the context of the negotiations that led to the Letter being sent, I have excluded that from my mind.
This judgment deals with the application so far as it relates to the Letter. The Letter is annexed to this judgment.
The starting point is, of course, that without prejudice correspondence is inadmissible. The rule was explained by Lord Griffiths in Rush & Tompkins Limited v Greater London Council [1989] AC 1280 at 1289:
“The ""without prejudice"" rule is a rule governing the admissibility of evidence and is founded upon the public policy of encouraging litigants to settle their differences rather than litigate them to a finish. It is nowhere more clearly expressed than in the judgment of Oliver L.J. in Cutts v. Head [1984] Ch. 290, 306:
“That the rule rests, at least in part, upon public policy is clear from many authorities, and the convenient starting point of the inquiry is the nature of the underlying policy. It is that parties should be encouraged so far as possible to settle their disputes without resort to litigation and should not be discouraged by the knowledge that anything that is said in the course of such negotiations (and that includes, of course, as much the failure to reply to an offer as an actual reply) may be used to their prejudice in the course of the proceedings. They should, as it was expressed by Clauson J. in Scott Paper Co. v. Drayton Paper Works Ltd. (1927) 44 R.P.C. 151, 156, be encouraged fully and frankly to put their cards on the table.... The public policy justification, in truth, essentially rests on the desirability of preventing statements or offers made in the course of negotiations for settlement being brought before the court of trial as admissions on the question of liability.""
The rule applies to exclude all negotiations genuinely aimed at settlement whether oral or in writing from being given in evidence. A competent solicitor will always head any negotiating correspondence ""without prejudice"" to make clear beyond doubt that in the event of the negotiations being unsuccessful they are not to be referred to at the subsequent trial. However, the application of the rule is not dependent upon the use of the phrase ""without prejudice"" and if it is clear from the surrounding circumstances that the parties were seeking to compromise the action, evidence of the content of those negotiations will, as a general rule, not be admissible at the trial and cannot be used to establish an admission or partial admission. I cannot therefore agree with the Court of Appeal that the problem in the present case should be resolved by a linguistic approach to the meaning of the phrase ""without prejudice."" I believe that the question has to be looked at more broadly and resolved by balancing two different public interests namely the public interest in promoting settlements and the public interest in full discovery between parties to litigation.”
The “without prejudice” rule is not absolute. There are exceptions and one of those relates to situations where to exclude material marked as without prejudice would act as a cloak for perjury, blackmail or other “unambiguous impropriety”. This was explained by Robert Walker LJ in Unilever PLC v The Proctor & Gamble Company [2000] 1 WLR 2436 in the following terms:
Nevertheless there are numerous occasions on which, despite the existence of without prejudice negotiations, the without prejudice rule does not prevent the admission into evidence of what one or both of the parties said or wrote. The following are among the most important instances.
Apart from any concluded contract or estoppel, one party may be allowed to give evidence of what the other said or wrote in without prejudice negotiations if the exclusion of the evidence would act as a cloak for perjury, blackmail or other ""unambiguous impropriety"" (the expression used by Hoffmann LJ in Foster v Friedland, 10 November 1992, CAT 1052). Examples (helpfully collected in Foskett's Law & Practice of Compromise, 4th ed, para 9-32) are two first-instances decisions, Finch v Wilson (8 May 1987) and Hawick Jersey International v Caplan (The Times 11 March 1988). But this court has, in Foster v Friedland and Fazil-Alizadeh v Nikbin, 1993 CAT 205, warned that the exception should be applied only in the clearest cases of abuse of a privileged occasion.”
Mr Higgins referred to examples of cases where privilege had been lost based on the unambiguous impropriety exception: Hawick Jersey International v Caplan (supra) and Merrill Lynch v Raffa [2001] ILPr 31 (a decision of HHJ Raymond Jack QC sitting as a deputy High Court judge). In the Raffa case evidence as to without prejudice discussions was admitted where to exclude it would have allowed the defendant to run a defence that he was not involved in a fraud when he had made admissions to his involvement in the fraud in the without prejudice discussions.
The Defendant’s case is that the Letter should be admitted as evidence in this case as it falls squarely within the unambiguous impropriety exception as it demonstrates that the Claimant accepts he has been fundamentally dishonest in relation to at least some aspects of his case and he should not be allowed to pursue a case where he disputes that he has been fundamentally dishonest.
The Claimant opposes the admission of the Letter in this case. His case is that (i) the Letter, properly analysed, does not contain any admission of fundamental dishonesty and (ii) that even if it does contain such an admission then it is not so clear as to come within the unambiguous impropriety exception.
Mr Morris directed me to a number of cases where the need to construe the exception narrowly was emphasised, particularly when the matter arises at an interim stage of the proceedings.
Males LJ said this at paragraph 64 of Motorola Solutions Inc & Others v Hytera Communications Corporation Limited & Another [2021] EWCA Civ 11:
As for the judge's second concern, I do not regard the fact that the test of good arguable case is used in other interim contexts as a sufficient reason to apply it to the issue of unambiguous impropriety when that issue arises at an interim stage of litigation. Rather, the position should be that the test remains one of unambiguous impropriety. Nothing less will do. That is a test which, deliberately, is difficult to satisfy but the fact that it arises on an interim application is no reason to dilute it. In view of the necessary limits to the conclusions which a court can reach at an interim stage, the existence of a credible dispute about what was said (or what was meant by what was said) may mean that a court cannot be satisfied that there has been an unambiguous impropriety and therefore does not admit the evidence, but that is simply the result of applying the test which has consistently and for good reason been held to apply. Plainly it would not be appropriate on an interim application to direct a trial of an issue to resolve such a dispute.”
Ms Pat Treacy, sitting as a judge of the Chancery Division, said this at paragraph 122 of Ocean on Land Technology (UK) Limited & Another v Richard Land & Others [2024] EWHC 396 (IPEC):
To recap, to fall within the exception, it is necessary to show that the without prejudice rule is being used to cloak wholly improper conduct and the possibility of perjury will not suffice. Conduct or statements which do not go beyond the bounds of what is to be expected in negotiation will not fall within the scope of the exception.”
Mr Morris also cited paragraphs 2 and 7 of the judgment of Lord Hope of Craighead in Ofulue v Bossert [2009] UKHL 16 but, in my judgment, they merely restate the law as set out above.
Mr Morris also submitted that it is not appropriate to dissect without prejudice discussions. He drew support for this proposition from the judgment of Peter Gibson LJ where he said, at paragraph 34 of Berry Trade Limited & Another v Moussavi & Others [2003] EWCA Civ 715:
In Unilever plc v Procter & Gamble Co. [2000] 1 WLR 2436 Robert Walker L.J. (with whom Simon Brown L.J. and Wilson J. agreed) said that the modern cases show that the protection of admissions against interest is the most important practical effect of the rule. He continued (at p. 2448H):
""But to dissect out identifiable admissions and withhold protection from the rest of without prejudice communications (except for a special reason) would not only create huge practical difficulties but would be contrary to the underlying objective of giving protection to the parties (in the words of Lord Griffiths in [Rush & Tomkins Ltd. v Greater London Council [1989] AC 1280,] 1300) ""to speak freely about all issues in the litigation both factual and legal when seeking compromise and, for the purpose of establishing a basis of compromise, admitting certain facts."" Parties cannot speak freely at a without prejudice meeting if they must constantly monitor every sentence, with lawyers or patent agents sitting at their shoulders as minders.”
Having set out the law, I must apply it to the Letter. The Letter is plainly headed “without prejudice – save as to costs” and was sent in an attempt to reach a settlement between the parties. It would normally attract the privilege that attaches to without prejudice correspondence.
Does the Letter contain an admission? The Claimant submits the answer to this question is no. Mr Morris says that paragraph 2 of proposed terms of settlement is a promise to admit something (that some representations in respect of his claim were fundamentally dishonest) in the future if it is contained within a non- disclosure agreement. The Defendant says the answer to the question is yes – the Letter is a clear acceptance by the Claimant that he has been, at least in part, fundamentally dishonest when presenting his claim.
Although I bear in mind the comments about dissection of without prejudice correspondence, and the need to proceed cautiously as this application is made at an interim stage, the answer to the question appears to me to be clear from the terms of the Letter. I also bear in mind that the Letter was written by experienced solicitors instructed by the Claimant to pursue his case. It was a letter that was, no doubt, carefully written. It seems to me that the Letter contains a clear admission that the Claimant has been fundamentally dishonest in the way he has put forward his case. It is written in the future tense but it is, in reality, no different from the promises in paragraph 1 of the proposed terms of settlement to pay back sums received by way of an interim payment and make a contribution to the Defendant’s costs.
Having concluded that the Letter contains an admission that the Claimant has acted in a way that has been fundamentally dishonest, I must now consider whether it falls within the unambiguous impropriety exception such that I should allow it to be admitted as evidence.
In my judgment the letter does fall within the unambiguous impropriety exception and should be admitted. I have found the Letter to be a clear admission of fundamental dishonesty on the part of the Claimant. That goes well beyond, say, an acceptance that the Claimant has over-egged his injuries, or their effects on his day to day activities, or a concession that some aspects of his case may be difficult to prove. All of those might be things said in usual exchanges in the context of without prejudice negotiations and which would fall to be protected by the without prejudice rule as they do not demonstrate unambiguous impropriety. Here the line has been crossed. If the Letter is excluded there is more than a risk of the Claimant perjuring himself, which would not of itself be sufficient to bring the exception into play, but the certainty that the Claimant’s pleaded case was being put forward on a (at least partly) false basis, which is sufficient to bring the exception into play. This is an example where the public policy arguments in favour of litigating disputes with full disclosure trump the policy argument in allowing parties to speak candidly and with protection of the contents of the discussions, to encourage settlements. This case is, I think, analogous to the Raffa (supra) case: to refuse to admit the Letter would permit the Claimant to benefit from an unambiguous impropriety.
Accordingly, and for the reasons I have given, I will allow the Letter to be adduced as evidence.

THE HON. MRS JUSTICE STEYN DBE
Mrs Justice Steyn DBE :
Introduction
This is a claim for defamation in respect of eight articles published by the defendant, and for breach of data protection legislation. The first and principal article, entitled, “‘Sexual predator’: actor Noel Clarke accused of groping, harassment and bullying by 20 women” was published online by the defendant at 19:35 on 29 April 2021 (‘the First Article’).
The single meaning of the First Article was found by Johnson J to be:
“there are strong grounds to believe that the Claimant is a serial abuser of women, that he has, over 15 years, used his power to prey on and harass and sometimes bully female colleagues, that he has engaged in unwanted sexual contact, kissing, touching or groping, sexually inappropriate behaviour and comments, and professional misconduct, taking and sharing explicit pictures and videos without consent, including secretly filming a young actor’s naked audition.”
The second to eighth articles, which were published between 30 April 2021 and 28 March 2022, covered similar territory. The meanings are, similarly, at the level of strong grounds to investigate, save for the final article which means, “there are grounds to investigate allegations against the Claimant of groping, harassment and bullying”: see Clarke v Guardian News & Media Ltd [2023] EWHC 2734 (KB),[55]-[62].
I heard the claimant’s application to strike out the Amended Defence, either in whole or in part, specifically, the defence of publication on a matter of public interest provided by s.4 of the Defamation Act 2013. I announced my decision to refuse to strike out the Amended Defence at the end of the hearing, indicating I would give my reasons in writing. This judgment contains my reasons.
History of the proceedings
The claimant issued a claim “protectively” on 29 April 2022. On 12 August 2022, his (former) solicitors sent a letter before claim putting the defendant “on notice of the claims our client intends to bring”. On 25 August 2022, the claim form was amended to remove the second to twelfth defendants, and add the data protection claim. The following day, the claim form and Particulars of Claim dated 26 August 2022 were served on the defendant. The claimant seeks, inter alia, an injunction and damages, including special damages of more than £10 million.
Following a meaning trial, on 1 November 2023, Johnson J handed down the judgment to which I have referred and made an order determining the meanings of the articles complained of. On 15 November 2023, the claimant served Amended Particulars of Claim.
The Defence and Reply were served, respectively, on 10 January 2024 and 3 April 2024. The Amended Defence and Amended Reply were served, respectively, on 3 and 17 May 2024.
Case management hearings took place before Master Thornett on 23 May and 4 July 2024, and a costs management hearing took place before Master Brown on 15 July 2024.
On 11 June 2024, the trial was listed to begin on 3 March 2025, with a time estimate of six weeks.
The parties exchanged simultaneous disclosure and inspection on 3 October 2024. That was nearly eight weeks later than originally envisaged in Master Thornett’s order of 23 May 2024, but in accordance with various extensions of time granted by consent, following applications by the defendant. The claimant’s solicitor, Mr Rao Hassan Khan, states that the defendant disclosed approximately 4400 documents for inspection (Khan 4, para 5).
Following a contested hearing of the claimant’s application for an extension of time to exchange witness statements, resulting in the grant of a shorter extension than sought, the parties duly exchanged witness statements on 5 December 2024. The defendant served 34 witness statements, of which 28 were adduced in support of the defence of truth, and six were adduced from journalists and editors at the Guardian, in support of the public interest defence. The defendant has indicated its intention to call 32 of those witnesses, and to rely on the evidence of the remaining two witnesses as hearsay evidence. The claimant served 15 statements, and he has indicated his intention to call all of these witnesses.
On 31 December 2024, the claimant issued the application to strike out which is the subject of this judgment, supported by the fourth witness statement of Mr Khan (‘Khan 4’).
The pre-trial review (‘PTR’) took place before me on 20 January 2025. On 6 January 2025, the claimant requested that the PTR hearing should be used, instead, to determine his strike out application and other applications which, at that point, had not yet been issued. On 8 January 2025, the claimant issued an application to join six proposed new defendants as parties, and to re-amend the Amended Particulars of Claim to plead unlawful means conspiracy and to amend the special damages claim. On 10 January 2025, the claimant applied for an extension of time for service of the trial bundles until 21 days after the PTR (i.e. 3 weeks rather than 8 weeks before trial). By an order dated 13 January 2025 (maintained on 15 January, following the claimant’s application to vary), I ordered that the PTR would deal with the trial management issues, and with directions in respect of the other applications.
The defendant served evidence in response to the strike out application on 14 January 2024 from Gaelyn Fuhrmann, the defendant’s solicitor (‘Fuhrmann 4’), Gillian Phillips, the defendant’s Editorial Legal Consultant (‘Phillips 1’), Nick Hopkins, the defendant’s Executive Editor for news (‘Hopkins 2’), Paul Lewis, the defendant’s Head of Investigations and principal editor responsible for supervising the two main reporters (‘Lewis 2’), Sirin Stewart (professional name, Sirin Kale), one of the two main journalists who wrote the Articles (‘Stewart 2’) and Lucy Osborne, the other main journalist (‘Osborne 2’).
At the PTR, I listed the strike out application for determination the following week. The claimant had also made an application for permission to cross-examine Mr Lewis. As there proved to be insufficient time to hear the application to cross-examine at the PTR, I listed that application for determination prior to hearing the strike out application.
On 23 January 2025, the claimant served the seventh witness statement of Mr Khan (‘Khan 7’), in reply to the defendant’s evidence.
Following the PTR, the trial remains listed to begin on 3 March 2025. The trial will address liability (only) in respect of the claim against the defendant as pleaded in the Amended Particulars of Claim. I have adjourned the application to amend to add a new cause of action, to increase the special damages claim to over £70 million, and to add six new defendants, until after the liability trial on the defamation and data protection claims against the defendant.
At the outset of the hearing on 29 January 2025, I heard the claimant’s application for permission to cross-examine Mr Lewis. For the reasons that I gave in my ex tempore judgment of the same date, I refused that application.
The Strike Out Application
By the application notice issued on 31 December 2024, the claimant sought an order pursuant to CPR 3.4(2), or the inherent jurisdiction of the Court, striking out the Amended Defence in its entirety, or alternatively paragraphs 104 to 161 of the Amended Defence concerning the public interest defence. The application also sought summary judgment pursuant to CPR 24.3, but the Claimant has withdrawn that part of the application: para 5 of my order of 20 January 2025 (sealed on 23 January 2025).
The reasons for the strike out application were set out in Khan 4. Mr Khan has made a very serious allegation against Mr Lewis, Ms Osborne and Ms Stewart, “and potentially other [unnamed] editors”, that they have committed the common law offence of perverting the course of justice (Khan 4, para 19). There are two elements to that allegation.
First, it is alleged that “various employees and agents of the Defendant”, including Mr Lewis, Ms Osborne and Ms Stewart, “deleted extensive evidence wholly relevant to these proceedings, knowing without reservation that the Defendant’s publications would form the subject of litigation” (Khan 4, para 6). Mr Khan relied on the alleged deletion on 29 April 2021 of two threads on the Signal group chat between Mr Lewis, Ms Osborne and Ms Stewart bearing the titles “Last Day” and “Final”, and, more generally, their use of “Disappearing Messages” (Khan 4, para 9). Mr Khan alleged there had been “deliberate and permanent deletion of all personal correspondence between the three journalists that undertook the purported investigation” (his emphasis, Khan 4, para 24), and “deletion of all relevant communications between these individuals” (Khan 4, para 28). (‘The suppression of evidence point’)
Second, Mr Khan alleged that Mr Lewis, Ms Osborne and Ms Stewart engaged in the “fabrication of correspondence to replace these [deleted] communications, in an overt attempt to pervert the course of justice” (Khan 4, para 28). The allegation of “fabrication” of evidence is made repeatedly: see Khan 4, paras 9.1, 10.4, 10.5, 11.1, 21, 24, 25 and 28. (‘The fabrication of evidence point’)
The allegations of suppression and fabrication of evidence are both maintained in the claimant’s reply evidence, a witness statement filed by Mr Khan on 23 January 2025 (‘Khan 7’). In respect of the fabrication of evidence point, Mr Khan alleges that the “new thread would inevitably have been carefully curated to ensure that it benefits the Defendant in these proceedings” (Khan 7 para 9(c)).
The law
CPR 3.4(2) provides:
“The court may strike out a statement of case if it appears to the court—
that the statement of case discloses no reasonable grounds for bringing or defending the claim;
that the statement of case is an abuse of the court’s process or is otherwise likely to obstruct the just disposal of the proceedings; or
that there has been a failure to comply with a rule, practice direction or court order.”
Paragraph 7 of CPR Practice Direction 31B provides:
“As soon as litigation is contemplated, the parties’ legal representatives must notify their clients of the need to preserve disclosable documents. The documents to be preserved include Electronic Documents which would otherwise be deleted in accordance with a document retention policy or otherwise deleted in the ordinary course of business.”
In Earles v Barclays Bank plc [2009] EWHC 2500 (Mercantile), [2010] Bus LR 566, Judge Simon Brown QC (sitting as a High Court Judge) held that under English law there is no duty to preserve documents prior to the commencement of proceedings ([28]), in sharp contrast to the position once proceedings have begun ([29]). However, Earles was decided before the duty in paragraph 7 of PD31B was introduced, albeit the express duty is on the parties’ legal representatives, and it is a duty to notify. It appears to be implicit that a person who has, prior to the commencement of proceedings, been notified of the need to preserve disclosable documents (or, as it is sometimes described, issued with a ‘litigation hold’), should comply. Moreover, the destruction of documents prior to the commencement of proceedings is capable, in principle and depending on the circumstances, of amounting to an attempt to pervert the course of justice.
The claimant relies on authorities on the availability of litigation privilege as demonstrating when litigation can be said to be “contemplated”. In Tchenguiz v Director of the Serious Fraud Office [2013] EWHC 2297 (QB), Eder J accepted the following submissions:
For a communication to be subject to litigation privilege it must have been made with the dominant purpose of being used in aid of or obtaining legal advice from a lawyer about actual or anticipated litigation: Thanki, The Law of Privilege (2nd ed) (‘Thanki’) paras 6.68ff and the cases there cited.
Where litigation has not been commenced at the time of the communication it has to be ‘reasonably in prospect’; this does not require the prospect of litigation to be greater than 50% but it must be more than a mere possibility: United States of America v Philip Morris & British American Tobacco [2004] EWCA Civ 330 at pars 67-68; Westminster International v Dornoch Ltd [2009] EWCA Civ 1323 at paras [19]-[20] (Etherton LJ).”
The answer to the question when litigation is contemplated for the purposes of paragraphs 7 of PD31B, such as to impose a duty to issue a litigation hold, is not necessarily the same as the test for when litigation is reasonably in prospect for the purposes of determining whether litigation privilege applies. Nevertheless, both parties adopted the test of whether litigation was in reasonable contemplation (see Hollander’s Documentary Evidence, (15th ed. 2024 (‘Hollander’), 12-06 to 12-07), and so that is the test I will apply.
In Douglas v Hello! Ltd (No.3) [2003] EWHC 55 (Ch), [2003] EMLR 29, Sir Andrew Morritt VC considered applications to strike out the Hello! defendants’ defence based on both pre- and post-commencement of litigation destruction of documents, and the giving of false evidence. At [86], he observed:
“There is, however a distinction to be drawn between those which were destroyed or disposed of before these proceedings were commenced and those which were destroyed or disposed of thereafter. With regard to the former category it is established in the very recent decision of the Court of Appeal for the State of Victoria in British American Tobacco Australia Services Ltd v Cowell and McCabe [2002] VSCA 197, paras [173] and [175] that the criterion for the Court’s intervention of the type sought on this application is whether that destruction or disposal amounts to an attempt to pervert the course of justice. There being no English authority on this point I propose to apply that principle, not only because the decision of the Court of Appeal for the State of Victoria is persuasive authority but because I respectfully consider it to be right.”
It is common ground, in light of Douglas v Hello!, that where an alleged destruction of documents took place before the proceedings commenced, that conduct cannot provide a basis for the Court to strike out a statement of case if it does not amount to perversion of, or an attempt to pervert, the course of justice (or, in the unlikely circumstances that such a remedy was available, contempt). I agree.
However, there is a dispute as to whether, as the defendant contends, even if that test is met, the court should only strike out the statement of case on that basis if a fair trial has been rendered impossible. The claimant contends that if the court is satisfied there has been an attempt to pervert the course of justice, no more is required to justify striking out the defence. The claimant submits that the impossibility of a fair trial is another, independent ground, on which the court may strike out a statement of case.
In Douglas v Hello!, on the facts, Sir Andrew Morritt VC considered it plain that the deletion of documents pre-action was not evidence of an attempt to pervert the course of justice and could not justify striking out any part of the defence ([87]). In those circumstances, he did not address the impact on the ability to hold a fair trial of the destruction of those documents.
He went on to consider the defendants’ conduct after the commencement of the action. He found that the defendants had presented three material but knowingly false statements, on the basis of which the interlocutory injunctions were discharged, as well as engaging in the “wholesale destruction or disposal of material documents” ([92]-[95]). It was in this context that Sir Andrew Morritt VC considered “whether a fair trial is achievable” ([88], [90]). He was not prepared to strike out the Hello! defendants’ defence, in whole or in part, because he was not persuaded that a fair trial was no longer possible ([104]).
In Hollander, the author observes:
“12-05 … Where destruction is in issue, it is important to consider when the destruction occurred, because it is not every destruction of documents which can be regarded as wrongdoing. … Everyone deletes, and thus potentially destroys, electronic documents all the time. A failure to retain the contents of overlarge mailboxes may occur without any nefarious intent. …
B. Litigation not in Reasonable Contemplation
12-06 Until litigation is in reasonable contemplation, there is no reason to do anything other than in the normal course of business. …
C. Litigation in Reasonable Contemplation
… CPR r.3.4(2)(c) provides for a power to strike out where there is a failure to comply with a practice direction. So it might in theory be possible to apply to strike out based on breach of CPR PD 31B para.7 … But unless the mental element of perversion of the course of justice is proved, how would the court exercise a power to strike out which can only be exercised where it considers the destruction would lead to a trial that was unfair? At the relevant time the proceedings have not even been started, let alone the issues crystallised.
In Australia the Victoria Court of Appeal considered this issue in Cowell. The court concluded that prior to the commencement of proceedings there was no general duty to preserve documents such as could be relied upon in support of an application to strike out the claim or defence. The only circumstances in which the court was entitled to grant any sanction was where the conduct amounted to an attempt to pervert the course of justice or (in the unlikely circumstances that such a remedy was available) contempt. The question of adverse inferences was not raised and the court did not deal with it.
The Victorian Court of Appeal contemplated that where document destruction prior to the commencement of proceedings constitutes a perversion of the course of justice, proved to the civil standard of proof, the court has power to strike out the subsequent claim or defence. It did not discuss the nature of the prejudice which would need to be shown to the other party before perversion of the course of justice would give rise to a strike out, but at least in England the court would only have power to prevent access to the court in this way if satisfied that a fair trial was in consequence not possible. …”
It is suggested that the position prior to the commencement of proceedings is therefore as follows:
The court will not strike out a claim unless the document destruction amounts to perversion of the course of justice and the court determines that this has prevented a fair trial from being possible.
…” (Emphasis added.)
At 12-13, the author considered Arrow Nominees v Blackledge [2000] CP Rep 59 in which the Court of Appeal overturned a decision not to strike out an action where there had been forgery of documents, observing:
“The Court of Appeal said that in all the circumstances it was not fair either to the respondents or to other litigants for the trial to continue. A decision to stop the trial was not for the purpose of punishment but in response to the party’s own continuing attempts to compromise a fair trial which would make a decision in his favour unsafe. Although the Court of Appeal emphasised the basis for the decision was whether the trial could be fair, dicta went somewhat further. Chadwick LJ said that:
‘a litigant who has demonstrated that he is determined to pursue proceedings with the object of preventing a fair trial has forfeited his right to take part in a trial. His object is inimical to the process which he purports to invoke.’
… In Dadourian Group [[2009] 1 Lloyd’s Rep. 601 at [233]] Arden LJ said about the passage from Chadwick LJ:
‘We consider that this paragraph is not to be read as meaning that a litigant who has demonstrated that he is determined to pursue proceedings with the object of preventing a fair trial is to be taken to have forfeited his right to a fair trial in every case. Chadwick LJ is careful to emphasise that the litigant’s conduct had put the fairness of the trial in jeopardy and that the court’s power to strike out the proceedings was not a penalty for disobedience with the rules.’
If Chadwick LJ’s dictum was read in any other way, it would be difficult to reconcile with ECHR art.6 rights of access to the court and the remedy of strike out would not be proportionate. So the court must always consider whether a fair trial is still possible. If so, it must not strike out the action or defence. The purpose of the remedy is not to punish, however deplorable the conduct of the defaulting party may be. The court must bear in mind that what it is being asked to do is to take away the access of the defaulting party to the court, which is a draconian remedy. The court must act in a manner which is proportionate. …” (Emphasis added.)
The claimant submits that the suggestion in Hollander that it is necessary both to show the document destruction amounts to perversion of the course of justice and that it has rendered a fair trial impossible is no more than the author’s suggestion. The claimant contends that it is inconsistent with Douglas v Hello! in which the court identified the test as being, simply, whether the destruction or disposal amounted to an attempt to pervert the course of justice.
In my judgment, the analysis given in Hollander, cited above, is correct. It is not inconsistent with Sir Andrew Morritt VC’s judgment. He did not address the question whether the pre-action destruction of documents rendered a fair trial impossible because he was not satisfied there had been an attempt to pervert the course of justice. If he had made a contrary finding, it seems likely he would have considered whether that rendered a fair trial impossible. Any other approach would have been inconsistent with the approach he took to post-commencement destruction and filing of knowingly false statements. There is no logical reason why the possibility of a fair trial was conclusive against the application to strike out, in respect of conduct as serious as knowingly filing false witness statements, and thereby obtaining the discharge of an injunction, as well as engaging in the “wholesale destruction” of material evidence after the commencement of proceedings, yet – on the claimant’s argument – would have been irrelevant and of no consequence if he had found that the pre-commencement destruction amounted to an attempt to pervert the course of justice.
The claimant’s argument also fails to address the point made by Arden LJ in Dadourian Group that the court’s strike out power is not to be used as a punishment. The parties have rights of access to the court, at common law and pursuant to article 6 of the Convention. Any decision to take away such access should be proportionate, and so will entail considering whether a fair trial remains possible.
For these reasons, I conclude that the court will not strike out a claim for destruction of documents prior to the commencement of the claim unless the document destruction amounts to perversion (or attempted perversion) of the course of justice and the court determines that this has prevented a fair trial from being possible.
The ingredients of the common law offence of perversion of the course of justice are that the alleged wrongdoer has (i) done an act or series of acts; (ii) which has or have a tendency to pervert; and (iii) which is or are intended to pervert (iv) the course of justice: R v Vreones [1891] QB 360, Pollock, B, p.369; Archbold, 28-1. A “course of justice must have been embarked upon in the sense that proceedings of some kind are in being or imminent or investigations which could or might bring proceedings about are in progress”: Archbold, 28-22.
In the context of these civil proceedings, the standard of proof by which the claimant must prove the alleged attempt to pervert the course of justice is the balance of probabilities. But as Andrew Smith J observed in Fiona Trust and Holding Corp v Privalov (2) [2010] EWHC 3199 (Comm) at [1438]-[1439]:
“It is well established that ‘cogent evidence is required to justify a finding of fraud or other discreditable conduct’: per Moore-Bick LJ in Jafari-Fini v Skillglass Ltd [2007] EWCA Civ 261 at para 73. This principle reflects the court’s conventional perception that it is generally not likely that people will engage in such conduct: ‘where a claimant seeks to prove a case of dishonesty, its inherent improbability means that, even on the civil burden of proof, the evidence needed to prove it must be all the stronger’, per Rix LJ in Markel v Higgins, [2009] EWCA Civ 790 at para 50. The question remains one of the balance of probability, although typically, as Ungoed-Thomas J put it in In re Dellow’s Will Trusts, [1964] 1 WLR 415, 455 (cited by Lord Nicholls in In re H, [1996] AC 563 at p.586H), ‘The more serious the allegation the more cogent the evidence required to overcome the unlikelihood of what is alleged and thus to prove it’. …
The principle requires flexibility in its application because it depends upon the improbability of the specific allegation that is made and the particular circumstances of the case. … Thus in the Jafari-Fini case at para 49, Carnwath LJ recognised an obvious qualification to the application of the principle, and said, ‘Unless it is dealing with known fraudsters, the court should start from a strong presumption that the innocent explanation is more likely to be correct.’”
Application to the facts
When the application was filed, the allegations of suppression and fabrication of evidence were based on three messages sent by Mr Lewis on 29 April 2021, on Signal, at 14:54 (on the “Last Day” thread), and at 17:43 and 17:44 (on the “Final” thread), and the use of disappearing messages (Khan 4, paras 9.1, 9.2 and 9.3). In his reply evidence, Mr Khan relies on a further message sent by Mr Lewis the same day at 14:46 (on the “Last Day” thread), which was omitted from the defendant’s standard disclosure, but disclosed as part of the exhibit to Fuhrmann 4. In his skeleton argument, the claimant relies on two further messages, sent by Mr Lewis at 14:56 (on the “Final” thread) and 15:11 (on the “Last Day” thread), which were contained in the defendant’s standard disclosure.
The first in time of these messages is of a different character to the remaining messages, and raises an ancillary disclosure issue. In response to a message from Ms Stewart regarding an audio recording of a phone call made by the claimant’s business partner, Jason Maza, to “an alleged victim of abuse”, Mr Lewis wrote:
“Can you have a listen and just be really sure there’s nothing in there that his QCs will use against us. Err on the side of caution on disclosing as much as possible that undermines our case.”
(14:46; “Last Day”)
The claimant contends this message, which I shall refer to as the ‘err on the side of caution message’, was clearly concerned with “the need to suppress unfavourable evidence” in the current proceedings, or contemplated litigation concerning the claimant (Khan 7, para 9(a)). Counsel describes it as “highly incriminating”. Mr Khan purports to give evidence as to the meaning of this message. Leaving aside any question as to the admissibility of such evidence, he states at paragraph 9(d) of Khan 7:
“The first sentence of the message is an instruction to verify that the relevant audio-file does not contain anything which is unfavourable to the Defendant. The second sentence follows directly from the first. In its natural and ordinary meaning, the second sentence directs the message’s recipient to be careful when disclosing as much as possible, lest it undermines the Defendant’s case in legal proceedings.”
As the allegations regarding this message were raised in the claimant’s reply evidence and submissions, Mr Lewis’s evidence does not address this message. However, no explanation from him is necessary. Read in context the meaning is plain, and provides no support for the very serious allegations made by the claimant.
The message was written less than five hours before the First Article was published. There were no proceedings on foot. The “case” to which Mr Lewis referred was the set of allegations in the (then) draft first article. When he spoke of “disclosing as much as possible that undermines our case”, Mr Lewis was obviously not referring to disclosure in litigation. He was directing the journalists to listen carefully to the audio recording and include in the article anything that was contrary to the allegations being made against the claimant. This instruction was of a piece with Mr Lewis’s message to the journalists at 16:30, “If any said positive things about Clarke we need to say that. PLEASE don’t leave anything out”. In referring to “his QCs”, Mr Lewis was indicating that the journalists should think about how an omission to include material in the article could potentially be made to look by a skilful lawyer, and put in “as much as possible that undermines our case”.
As regards the disclosure issue, Ms Fuhrmann’s evidence is that the whole of the “Last Day” and “Final” threads were provided to the defendant’s Editorial Legal team in May 2023, and then duly passed to Wiggin LLP who represent the defendant. Those two threads were included by the defendant in its standard disclosure on 3 October 2024, save that “1-page was inadvertently omitted from the middle of a 24-page thread” (that is the message at 14:46 on the “Last Day”) and the “top ‘title’ page” of the other thread.
Specifically, in relation to the err on the side of caution message, Ms Furhmann states (Furhmann 4, para 21):
“1 page out of 24 pages of the ‘Last Day’ thread was not disclosed. This firm has identified through the tagging of the document on the disclosure platform that the document was coded such that it was intended to be disclosed. Presumably through manual error, a sub-tag related to privilege had been simultaneously checked which led to the document being automatically but erroneously excluded from the disclosure pool when the document production was prepared. The Defendant’s e-disclosure provider had carried out extensive quality control checks to identify and correct any inadvertently conflicting tagging and it appears that this page was an anomaly.”
In reply, Mr Khan suggests that the fact that this message was omitted from the “Last Day” thread when standard disclosure was given by the defendant, and only disclosed appended to Ms Fuhrmann’s fourth witness statement, is inexplicable. He states (Khan 7, para 12):
“This needs to be considered in light of the incriminating nature of the message. In what manner this relevant and incriminating evidence could somehow be ‘inadvertently omitted’ by the Defendant’s extensive internal team and large legal team is plainly questionable.”
In their oral submissions, counsel for the claimant submitted that the omission could not be “innocent”.
I accept Ms Fuhrmann’s evidence as to how the omission occurred. Although it is unfortunate that the error occurred, there is absolutely no reason to doubt her explanation as to how it occurred. As Ms Furhmann rightly acknowledges, the message is not privileged. But it is understandable that the terms of the message led someone on the disclosure team to incorrectly tag it as privileged. In light of Ms Fuhrmann’s evidence, there is no basis for the accusation that the omission was not an innocent and inadvertent error. In any event, no support for the strike out application can be derived from a minor, now corrected, disclosure error.
The other five messages from Mr Lewis, relied on by the claimant, in chronological order, are as follows:
“Can we all clear all of our Signal messages please? Delete this entire thread. I’ll create a new one, which will likely be disclosable in court, [sic]”
To which Ms Stewart and Ms Osborne both replied “yep”.
(14:54; “Last Day”)
“Final thread. We can delete all previous ones.”
(14:55; first message on “Final” thread.)
“Can we delete all these threads and use Final thread from now on”
(15:11; last message on “Last Day” thread.)
“Also please delete all Signal threads, including this one and individual one on one discusisns w’eve had, or you’ve had with each other [sic]”
(17:43; “Final”)
Sirin Kale: “Should we ask survivors to delete their histories with us? Or are they not usable in court?”
Paul Lewis: “No”
Paul Lewis: “Don’t ask them to delete anything”
Sirin Kale: “ok”
Paul Lewis: “But deletet his connvo just noow [sic]”
Sirin Kale: “Ok”
(17:44-17.45; “Final”)
It is not disputed that Mr Lewis intended that the “Last Day” and “Final threads” should be deleted. When bringing the strike out application, the claimant appears to have been under the misapprehension that those threads had been deleted. In fact, they still exist and had been disclosed to the claimant. Mr Lewis realised, when providing material to the defendant’s Editorial Legal team for consideration of whether it was disclosable, that when deleting those two threads he had only removed them from one device, and they remained on another. As I have said, in May 2023 he provided those threads to the defendant’s Editorial Legal team.
Mr Khan alleged that there has been “deliberate and permanent deletion of all personal correspondence between the three journalists that undertook the purported investigations” (Khan 4, para 24; his emphasis). That is not true. There has been disclosure not only of the “Last Day” and “Final” threads but also of emails between them. Nevertheless, the claimant relies on message (5), and the lack of one-to-one communications between the journalists in the defendant’s disclosure, in support of the contention that such communications were deleted.
In addition, the claimant relies on the fact, confirmed by Ms Fuhrmann, that four Signal threads, on which Mr Lewis, Ms Osborne and Ms Stewart communicated, were auto-deleted. Ms Fuhrmann states (Fuhrmann 4, para 18):
“Mr Lewis’s usual approach in respect of Signal messages was to set them to auto-delete, as he explains in his statement. Messages sent in threads after auto-delete had been enabled were automatically erased either 1 day or 1 week after they were sent (depending on which auto-delete setting was chosen). 4 threads relevant to the investigation had auto-delete enabled shortly after they were created; these were called ‘Noel Clarke’, ‘Conference’, ‘Clarke aftermath’, and ‘Nc’ (the ‘Auto-deleted Threads’). With respect to the Auto-deleted Threads, the only messages which were preserved beyond 1 day or 1 week (as applicable) were those few which had been sent at the start of the thread, before the auto-delete function was enabled.”
The disclosed threads show:
The ‘Noel Clarke’ thread was created on 7 April 2021 and, the same day, after a few messages had been exchanged, Mr Lewis set the disappearing message time to 1 day. The thread remained in use until about 28 April 2021 (Lewis 2, para 35(a)).
The ‘Conference’ thread was created by Mr Lewis on 7 May 2021 and, the same day, after a few messages had been exchanged, he set the disappearing message time to 1 week.
The ‘Clarke aftermath’ thread was created by Ms Osborne on 1 June 2021 and, the same day, after a few messages had been exchanged, Mr Lewis set the disappearing message time to 1 week.
The ‘Nc’ thread was created by Ms Stewart on 28 May 2022 to share an interview with the claimant published in the Mail on Sunday. Mr Lewis set messages to auto-delete after 1 day (Lewis 2, para 35(f)).
The claimant contends that “actual deletion took place, of (at least) four Group Chats, one-on-one personal correspondence between each of the journalists, possible audio recordings and perhaps further correspondence”. There is no evidence of deletion of audio recordings or further correspondence. It follows that the suppression of evidence point can only be based on the deletion of the four Auto-deleted Threads, the possible deletion of some one-to-one communications between the journalists, and the failed attempt to delete the ‘Last Day’ and ‘Final’ threads.
As the passage from Hollander cited above states, everyone deletes electronic documents all the time. The questions that arise, here, are whether the deletions or attempted deletions occurred when litigation was in reasonable contemplation, whether those acts have a tendency to pervert the course of justice, and whether the alleged wrongdoers intended to pervert the course of justice.
The claimant alleges that Mr Lewis, Ms Osborne and Ms Stewart were “aware that litigation was clearly contemplated prior to deletion” (Khan 4, para 10). The primary basis for this allegation is correspondence sent to the defendant by the claimant’s (then) solicitors, Simkins, on 27, 28 and 29 April 2021 (which was cc’d and/or forwarded to Mr Lewis, Ms Osborne and Ms Stewart). The claimant also relies on the fact that Mr Lewis arranged a meeting at 5.30pm on 27 April 2021, bearing the title “Noel Clarke / Legal / Public Interest”, attended by, among others Ms Phillips. In addition, he draws attention to Mr Lewis’s references to court and QCs in the messages quoted above, a suggestion by Ms Stewart in a message to a friend that publication was “unbelievably high risk”, and “I think he will sue us”.
Simkins sent a letter on 27 April 2021 at 08:59 in which they expressed their client’s strong denial of “any and all allegations of abuse, assault and/or unlawful behaviour”, requested an extension of time to respond, and asserted “our client’s rights are reserved in full”. The same day at 16:56, they sent a 29-page letter addressing the allegations, asserting that they contain “false and highly defamatory accusations” which are denied, referring to the “inherent legal risk”, asserting that “any defence of truth is bound to fail”, and that “you cannot reasonably be expected to succeed with a defence of publication on a matter of public interest”, addressing misuse of private information, and again stating “our client’s rights are reserved, including the right to bring defamation proceedings in respect of any false and defamatory allegations published about him"".
On 28 April 2021, at 17:09, Simkins alleged that the steps taken by the defendant’s journalists to investigate “has resulted in our client being defamed in and of itself, quite separate from whether or not the Proposed Article is ultimately published”. They stated their client would hold the defendant responsible for such harm and asked the Guardian to “cease and desist from further defaming him”, again asserting “Our client’s rights are fully reserved”.
On 29 April 2021, at 10:43, Simkins requested an extension of time and again reserved their client’s rights. Later the same day, at 16:03, Simkins provided a further substantive response, in which they identified what they described as “very considerable legal risks” of publication, asserted that their client “will not hesitate to hold the Guardian fully responsible if it proceeds to publish any highly defamatory allegations”, and reserved their rights in full.
All of these letters were written prior to publication of the First Article, and so before any cause of action had arisen (other than that alleged in the 28 April letter, in respect of which no intention to sue was asserted). None was a letter before action. No letter before action was sent until 12 August 2022, more than 15 months after the First Article was published, and more than three months after the claimant issued a protective claim on the final day of the limitation period. The letter before action stated it was to put the Guardian “on notice of the claims our client intends to bring”. Simkins’ letters did not state the claimant intended to bring any claim; they reserved his rights to do so.
Ms Phillips was the defendant’s Director of Editorial Legal Services at the material time. She has given evidence that pursuant to paragraph 7 of PD31B,
“the practice at GNM, and I believe at other media organisations, is for the legal department to issue a notice often called a ‘litigation hold’ to the editorial staff when it is clear that a legal claim is contemplated. This alerts the staff to the need to retain all documents that are or might be disclosable under the CPR. Until such litigation hold is issued, the practice to encourage staff to review, and where they feel appropriate delete, any non-essential investigation documents remains.
In the case of the investigation that led to the publication of a series of articles about the Claimant, I did not send a litigation hold at the pre-publication stage because I did not consider litigation was reasonably in contemplation at the time. I believe that I was correct not to do so.”
(Phillips 1, paras 15-16).
Mr Hopkins states that:
“GNM’s Editorial Legal function issued preservation notices in respect of this case after we received a letter before action from Mr Clarke’s then-solicitors on 12 August 2022.”
Ms Phillips addresses Simkins’ letters at paragraphs 17-26 and explains in detail why she did not understand those letters, written in response to the invitation to comment sent by the journalists, to amount to “any sort of real or current intention to sue such that it should be said that litigation is contemplated and a ‘litigation hold’ notice is required”. The language used was “simply part of the cut and thrust of pre-publication correspondence”, the aim of which, generally speaking, is to stop the article being published or restrict what is said about their client. The wording used in Simkins’ letters was, Ms Phillips states:
“just standard generic wording that lawyers like to include in their pre-publication letters. I did not regard its use in this instance as being any more indicative of the likelihood of litigation, let alone that litigation was reasonably contemplated, than in any other instance where it was used. Not least because, at this point in time, nothing had actually been published, and unless and until something was published, there was never anything for proceedings to bite on. Any legal action is going to be entirely contingent on whether, and if so what, is published. Taken at its highest the use of such language in legal correspondence might be taken to indicate the future possibility of legal action.”
Mr Lewis states:
“I have always understood that the point at which I should take steps to preserve relevant materials in anticipation of legal proceedings is when I receive a preservation notice, or ‘litigation hold’, from my legal department. The date on which I intended these messages to be deleted was 16 months before the Claimant sent a letter before claim to the Guardian, which is the point at which my legal department sent me a litigation hold notice.”
(Lewis 2, para 45 and 50. Counsel for the claimant queried the reference to a 16-month period, but it is obvious that it is a reference to the letter before claim of 12 August 2022.)
Mr Lewis has addressed Simkins’ letters and given clear evidence as to why they did not prompt him to believe litigation was likely in this instance. He states (Lewis 2, paras 49-50):
“If anything, the language about the Claimant’s rights being reserved was less threatening, and less specific than that which I had read in pre-publication letters from law firms in the preceding months and years.
In none of these cases did the legal threats contained in law firm letters I had read up until that point result in their clients issuing proceedings against us after we published articles. And none of these threatening letters prompted my legal department to issue me with a document preservation notice, which I have always understood to be the point at which I should take steps to preserve relevant materials in anticipation of legal proceedings.”
Ms Osborne explains that she did not believe when asked by Mr Lewis on 29 April to delete messages that she was under any duty to preserve the messages, “as we had not received a preservation order from the Guardian’s legal team” (Osborne 2, para 12). Similarly, Ms Stewart’s evidence is that she “did not believe at the time that we were under a legal duty to preserve documents”, or that deleting the “quickfire back-and-forth queries that would have formed in-person conversations if we’d been able to work in an office … would have any consequence for any future proceedings” (Stewart 2, para 11).
The claimant asserts that it is “inconceivable that the Defendant had not already been advised that they had a duty to preserve evidence”. However, the clear and consistent evidence of the defendant’s witnesses is that the litigation hold was issued on receipt of the letter before action and not before. There is no basis for challenging that evidence.
Nor does the meeting Mr Lewis set up on 27 April 2021 provide any support for the contention that the threshold for document preservation had by then been reached. It is obvious that on a publication of the kind at issue here, legal input would be sought. That does not begin to show that litigation was by then reasonably contemplated.
In my judgment, the defendant’s legal team cannot fairly be criticised for taking the view they did that litigation was only in reasonable contemplation when the letter before action was sent on 12 August 2022. But even if that were wrong, it would indicate nothing more than a misjudgement by lawyers on an issue which, as Hollander puts it at 12-05, is not simple.
The allegation of perversion of the course of justice is made against Mr Lewis, Ms Osborne and Ms Stewart. I am unpersuaded that the deletion of documents they undertook had a tendency to pervert the course of justice. The nature of the threads is apparent from the two that survived the attempt to delete them. I bear in mind the importance of not pre-judging any issue which the court will ultimately have to determine in the course of the present proceedings, but on the face of it, it is hard to see how anything in those threads would be capable of changing the outcome of this case, in which there is a mass of other evidence that the court will need to consider in due course at trial.
But, again, if I were wrong, this application inevitably fails at the stage of lack of intention to pervert the course of justice. Mr Lewis, Ms Osborne and Ms Stewart were free to delete these peripheral documents in accordance with their organisation’s data minimisation policy, at a time when the legal department had not instructed them to preserve potentially disclosable documents. They are not lawyers and cannot fairly be criticised for following their legal department’s lead on when a duty to preserve documents applied.
I note that three of the threads which have been deleted post-date publication of the First Article. But the deletion occurred at a time when there had been no legal correspondence since publication of the First Article, and long before the letter before action was sent.
I can take the fabrication of evidence point shortly. Although this extremely serious allegation has been made, repeatedly, by solicitors and Counsel for the claimant, it has no foundation. The claimant’s application and supporting evidence left entirely vague what, if any, evidence Mr Lewis, or anyone else, is accused of fabricating. At one stage, it was tenuously suggested that the ‘Final’ thread is fabricated evidence. That was an extraordinary suggestion given (i) the messages are provided by all three journalists, so any fabrication would have had to be agreed by all of them; (ii) the rapid back-and-forth content of the ‘Final’ thread is very far indeed from anything that smacks of fabrication; and (iii) Mr Lewis intended that this thread should be deleted. I reject it.
In oral submissions, Counsel for the claimant, sought to assert that the term fabrication was justified because the deletion of documents altered the overall impression. It was said that the deletion of some threads of evidence, modifying the story, was “an attempt to swindle” the claimant. The approach taken by the claimant’s representatives is unacceptable: deletion is not fabrication, and such a grave allegation should not have been made and publicly aired without foundation. Ultimately, leading Counsel for the claimant, Mr Williams, made clear that the claimant does not allege that Mr Lewis (or Ms Osborne, Ms Stewart or anyone else on the part of the defendant) has created a false document.
I reject the contention that the defendant has perverted or attempted to pervert the course of justice. There has been no fabrication of evidence. Some documents were deleted prior to the commencement of proceedings, and over a year before a letter before claim giving notice of the intended claims was sent to the defendant. But such deletion was not in breach of any rule or duty to preserve document, and in any event it neither had the tendency to pervert, nor was it intended to pervert the course of justice.
As the allegation of perversion of the course of justice fails, it follows that the strike out application must inevitably be rejected in its entirety. However, it also, independently, fails on the ground that such deletion of evidence as has occurred does not render a fair trial impossible. Far from it. The truth defence is primarily dependent on the evidence that the court will hear at trial from the numerous witnesses to be called by both parties. Thousands of documents have been served in respect of the public interest defence, as well as substantial witness statements. The deletion of a small number of documents is a matter the court can consider, if and to the extent it is appropriate to do so. It does not render a fair trial impossible. Finally, I note that no basis for suggesting a fair trial of the data protection claim would be impossible was even put forward.
Conclusion
For the reasons I have given, the application to strike out the Amended Defence fails both on the grounds that the defendant has not perverted or attempted to pervert the course of justice, and because such limited pre-action deletion of documents as has occurred is not such as to preclude a fair trial of the claim.

Appellant
and
REGISTRAR OF APPROVED DRIVING INSTRUCTORS
Respondent
Decision: The appeal is Dismissed. The Registrar’s decision of 14 June 2024 is upheld.
REASONS
Introduction
The Appellant is a trainee driving instructor who was granted a trainee licence under section 129 of the Road Traffic Act 1988 (the “Act”), for one six-month period from 27 November 2023 to 26 May 2024. She was refused a second trainee licence by a decision of the Registrar of Approved Driving Instructors (‘the Registrar’) made on 14 June 2024. The Appellant now appeals that decision.
The parties have agreed to a paper determination of the appeal. The Tribunal is satisfied that it can properly determine the issues without a hearing within rule 32(1)(b) of The Tribunal Procedure (First-tier Tribunal) (General Regulatory Chamber) Rules 2009 (as amended).
What follows is a summary of the submissions, evidence and our view of the law. It does not seek to provide every step of our reasoning.   The absence of a reference by us to any specific submission or evidence does not mean it has not been considered.
Legal Framework
The Appellant's name is not on the Register of Approved Driving Instructors (""the Register"") and is therefore prohibited from giving paid driving instructions by section 123 (1) of the Act unless she holds a trainee licence issued by the Registrar pursuant to section 129(1) of the Act.
The grant of a trainee licence enables applicants to provide instruction for payment before they are qualified. A trainee licence under section 129(1) of the Act is granted:
‘for the purpose of enabling a person to acquire practical experience in giving instruction in driving motor cars with a view to undergoing such part of the examination... as consists of a practical test of ability and fitness to instruct.’
In order to qualify as an Approved Driving Instructor, applicants must pass the ‘Qualifying Examination’ comprised of three parts: the written examination (‘Part 1’); the driving ability and fitness test (‘Part 2’); and the instructional ability and fitness test (‘Part 3’).
The whole qualifying examination must be completed within two years of passing Part 1, and only three attempts are allowed for each Part, failure to comply with either of these requirements results in the whole examination needing to be retaken.
If a candidate has passed Part 2, they may be granted a trainee licence. The grant of a trainee licence enables applicants to provide instruction for payment before they are qualified. It is possible to qualify as an Approved Driving Instructor without having held a trainee licence.
By section 129(3) of the Act
""The Registrar may refuse to grant a licence under this section to an applicant to whom such a licence has previously been issued.""
By section 129(8)(c) of the Act
""before deciding whether or not to refuse the application, the Registrar must take into consideration any such representations made within that period.""
By section 129(6) of the Act:-
""Notwithstanding any provision of regulations made by virtue of subsection (5) above prescribing the period for which a licence is to be in force, where a person applies for a new licence in substitution for a licence held by him and current at the date of the application, the previous licence shall not expire—
(a)until the commencement of the new licence, or
if the Registrar decides to refuse the application, until the time limited for an appeal under the following provisions of this Part of this Act against the decision has expired and, if such an appeal is duly brought, it is finally disposed of.""
The powers of the Tribunal in determining this appeal are set out in s.131 of the Act. The Tribunal may make such order as it thinks fit.
When making its Decision, the Tribunal stands in the shoes of the Registrar and takes a fresh decision on the evidence available to it, giving appropriate weight to the Registrar’s decision as the person tasked by Parliament with making such decisions. The burden of proof in satisfying the Tribunal that the Registrar’s decision was wrong rests with the Appellant.
The Appeal
The Appellant’s notice of appeal dated 25 June 2024 relies on the following grounds as reasons for the appeal:
She had less training during her first trainee licence due to the significant caring responsibilities she has for others.
She has a second Part 3 test scheduled for the 14 August 2024.
She needs to be able to show a valid trainee licence to her insurer otherwise her driving instructor insurance will be cancelled and she will not be able to further train or attend the test.
The Appellant’s notice of appeal also stated her desired outcome of the appeal is “to be granted a second trainee licence in order to continue training before the test on the 14th of August [as] I have paid for the test”.
Additionally in the Appellant’s representations to the Registrar by email of the 28 May 2024 she also set out that:
She was unable to pass the Part 3 test on the first attempt due to several personal challenges.
Her caring responsibilities “significantly limited [her] ability to focus on [her] training.”
She had attempted to book a second Part 3 Test but it was put on hold by the system.
The Registrar’s notice of refusal dated 14 June 2024 states the reasons for the refusal as:
The Appellant failed to comply with the conditions of the first licence.
The Appellant had already been granted one trainee licence of six months duration which is considered to be a more than adequate period of time.
It was not Parliament’s intention that the candidates should be issued licences for as long as it takes them to pass the examination and the trainee licence system must not be allowed to become an alternative to registration as a fully qualified Approved Driving Instructor.
The Registrar’s statement of case dated 4 July 2024 resists the appeal. The Registrar states that:
The Appellant failed to comply with the conditions of her first licence as the training objectives on her ADI 21 AT training record form were not all completed within the first three months of the licence period (para 5).
The purpose of the provisions governing the issue of licences is to afford applicants the opportunity of giving instruction to members of the public whilst endeavouring to achieve registration. The system of issuing licences is not and must not be allowed to become an alternative to the system of registration (para 6(i)).
The licence granted to applicants is not to enable the instructor to teach for however long it takes to pass the examinations, but to allow up to six months experience of instruction. This provides a very reasonable period in which to reach the qualifying standard in the examination and in particular, to obtain any necessary practical experience in tuition. Moreover, by virtue of the Appellant having applied for a second licence before the expiry date of the first, that licence has remained in force to the present time and will allow her to continue to give paid instruction until determination of the appeal (para 6(ii)).
Since passing her driving ability test the Appellant has failed the instructional ability test once (Annex A) Despite ample time and opportunity the Appellant has not been able to reach the required standard for qualification as an Approved Driving Instructor. (para 6(iii)).
The refusal of a second licence does not bar the Appellant from attempting the instructional ability test of the Register examinations. She does not need to hold a licence for that purpose, nor is it essential for her to give professional tuition under licence in order to obtain further training. The Appellant could attend a training course, or study and practice with an Approved Driving Instructor or give tuition on her own (provided that she does not receive payment of any kind for this). These alternatives are used by some trainees who acquire registration without obtaining any licences at all (para 6(iv)).
The evidence
We considered a bundle of evidence containing 20 numbered pages, including the Appellants full trainee licence history from the registrar up to 4 July 2024.
Conclusions
We have considered the Appellant’s points of appeal.
We accept that the Appellant’s personal circumstances and significant caring responsibilities will likely have impacted her ability and availability to train during the period of her first trainee licence and prior to her unsuccessful attempt of the Part 3 test on 23 May 2024.
We are aware that it can be difficult to book a Part 3 test and it is common for the system to take a booking but immediately place it ‘on hold’ without a date being set for the Part 3 Test. However, we also note that the Appellant had a second attempt at the Part 3 Test scheduled for the 14 August 2024 (it is unknown to us whether that Test took place and if it did, what the outcome was).
We also accept that the holding of a Trainee licence is necessary in order to maintain the necessary insurance needed when training by giving instruction for payment.
Nevertheless, despite it being a common misunderstanding, it is not the case that individuals are entitled to continual renewal of trainee licences until they pass their Part 3 test. The six month period of such licences is set on the basis this is an adequate period to prepare for the Part 3 Test, and it is not necessary to hold a Trainee Licence in order to either prepare for or to take the Part 3 test.
We note that the Appellant has already had the benefit of one trainee licence covering a period of six months from 27 November 2023 to 26 May 2024. Additionally, by applying for a second trainee licence the Appellant has had the benefit of s.129(6)(b) of the Act extending the first trainee licence until this appeal is disposed of (i.e. a period of almost 14 months).
We further note that had the second trainee licence been granted this would have expired at the end of November 2024, long before the consideration of this Appeal and providing a total of only 12 months coverage.
We also note that the Appellant passed her Part 1 test on the 22 December 2022 and so her two-year period within which she must have passed both the Part 2 and Part 3 tests had expired by the 23 December 2024.
The Appellant has therefore had the benefit of being able to train by giving instruction for payment for an additional period of almost 8 months. Notably exceeding both:
her stated desired appeal outcome of an extension so as to allow her to continue training up to her booked Part 3 Test on the 14 August 2024, as well as
the fixed statutory maximum period within which she must pass the Part 3 test.
The Appellant has not persuaded us that the Registrar’s decision was wrong in any way. In all the circumstances, we agree with the Registrar’s decision and dismiss this appeal.

MRS JUSTICE BACON:
Introduction
This is the determination of jurisdiction challenges under CPR Pt 11 pursued by all of the remaining defendants, in respect of a claim for damages said to have been suffered by the claimants as a result of cartels in which the defendants were or are said to have been involved, in breach of Article 101 TFEU and Article 53 of the EEA Agreement. The products in issue are thermal system components (TSCs) in cars, which either regulate the ambient temperature inside the vehicle, or cool the engine.
The claim is based (in various ways explained below) on European Commission Decision C(2017) 1465 final, dated 8 March 2017 (the Commission Decision), which found there to have been price coordination or market sharing between undertakings from six manufacturing groups, in respect of sales of air conditioning and engine cooling products to a number of car manufacturers in the EEA, in breach of EU and EEA competition law. A summary of the Commission Decision was published in the Official Journal on 30 May 2017: [2017] OJ C 169/19.
In addition to the Commission Decision, the claimants rely on investigations and decisions by a number of other overseas competition regulators. The most significant of these (for the purposes of the claims) is an investigation and judgment by Brazil’s Administrative Council for Economic Defence (CADE). In addition, the claimants rely on investigations and/or decisions by regulators in the US, Japan, South Korea, Mexico, South Africa and Indonesia.
The claim form was initially issued on 7 March 2022, making claims against 19 defendants from the six manufacturing groups addressed by the Commission Decision. Following several extensions of time, settlements with some of the defendants, and amendments to the claim form (some but not all of which were consequential on the settlements), the proceedings were served on the defendants within the jurisdiction (the service-in defendants) on 19 September 2023. The defendants outside the jurisdiction (the service-out defendants) were served on various dates between 20 September 2023 and 18 March 2024.
The hearing then took place on 24–25 July 2024. By that time the remaining defendants following the various settlements fell into three groups: DENSO (the first to fifth defendants), Valeo (the sixth to tenth defendants) and Sanden (the twelfth and thirteenth defendants).
Jurisdiction was contested by those defendants on essentially three bases: (i) Valeo disputed the extension of time for service on it granted by Deputy Master Smith on 15 May 2023; (ii) various arguments were advanced regarding the applicability of the jurisdictional gateways for the service-out defendants; (iii) all of the defendants disputed jurisdiction on forum non conveniens grounds, arguing that the claims have minimal connection with England and that the most appropriate forum is France. Valeo therefore contended that the extension of time should be set aside, such that the claims against it should be dismissed ab initio, and all of the defendants contended that the order permitting service out should be set aside and/or that the proceedings should be stayed on grounds of forum non conveniens.
Following the hearing, and at the request of the court, further evidence was submitted by the claimants and Valeo on the specific issue of the extent of any settlement negotiations or discussions between those parties during the period prior to the service of the proceedings on Valeo, which was relevant to the issue of the extension of time.
Matters did not, however, rest there. On 15 October 2024, shortly before this judgment was going to be circulated in draft to the parties, the court was informed that the claimants had settled with Sanden (the Sanden settlement agreement), leaving only the claims against DENSO and Valeo. Written submissions on the consequences of that settlement for the jurisdiction issues were then filed by DENSO, Valeo and the claimants, between 15 October and 6 November 2024 (the October/November 2024 submissions). DENSO and Valeo contended that the Sanden settlement agreement left no remaining anchor defendant for the claims by the first three claimants, and that the removal of the Sanden defendants from the claims further supported their forum non conveniens challenge. The claimants contended that both the jurisdictional gateway and forum non conveniens arguments were unaffected by the Sanden settlement agreement.
By early December, this judgment was close to finalisation following the further submissions of the parties. On 9 December 2024, however, the claimants requested that the court stay its judgment to allow them to apply for permission to adduce further evidence which had been obtained from Sanden following the settlement agreement. The claimants’ application was then submitted on 20 December 2024, with written response and reply submissions filed on 13 and 20 January 2025 respectively.
I have taken all of the further submissions into account in this judgment.
The parties
The claimants are all companies within the Stellantis group, which was formed by the 2021 merger of the former Peugeot group (PSA) and the Fiat Chrysler Automobiles group (FCA). The PSA group owned the Peugeot, Citroën and DS brands, and in 2017 it acquired the Opel and Vauxhall brands from General Motors. The first to third claimants (the OV claimants) operate the Opel and Vauxhall brands. The fourth, ninth, and tenth claimants (the PSA claimants) are companies formerly within the PSA group who operate the remaining PSA group brands. The fifth to eighth claimants (the FCA claimants) are companies formerly within the FCA group. The eleventh and twelfth claimants (the Brazilian claimants) were formerly within the PSA and FCA groups, respectively.
The claimants are all companies which claim to have purchased TSCs for incorporation in the vehicles they manufacture and sell, from the defendants as well as other suppliers of TSCs. The countries where the claimants are incorporated are as follows:
first claimant, Vauxhall Motors Ltd – UK;
second claimant, Opel Automobile GmbH – Germany;
third claimant, Stellantis España SL – Spain;
fourth claimant, PSA Automobiles SA – France;
fifth claimant, FCA Italy SPA – Italy;
sixth claimant, FCA Srbija d.o.o. Kragujevac – Serbia;
seventh claimant, FCA Poland SA – Poland;
eighth claimant, Maserati SpA – Italy;
ninth claimant, GIE PSA Trésorerie – France;
tenth claimant, Stellantis NV (the top holding company of the Stellantis group) – Netherlands;
eleventh claimant, Peugeot Citroën Do Brasil Automóveis LTDA – Brazil;
twelfth claimant, FCA Fiat Chrysler Automóveis LTDA – Brazil.
The defendants remaining in the claim are (as set out above) all companies in the DENSO and Valeo groups, which have at times said to be material been in business in the manufacture and sale of automotive parts including TSCs. Their countries of incorporation are as follows:
first defendant, DENSO Automotive UK Ltd – UK;
second defendant, DENSO Corporation – Japan;
third defendant, DENSO Europe BV – Netherlands;
fourth defendant, DENSO Automotive Deutschland GmbH – Germany;
fifth defendant, DENSO Manufacturing UK Ltd – UK;
sixth defendant, Valeo SE – France;
seventh defendant, Valeo Klimasysteme GmbH – Germany;
eighth defendant, Valeo GmbH – Germany;
ninth defendant, Valeo Systèmes Thermiques SAS – France;
tenth defendant, Valeo Japan Co Ltd – Japan.
The erstwhile twelfth defendant, Sanden Corporation is also incorporated in Japan. The erstwhile thirteenth defendant, Sanden International (Europe) GmbH, is incorporated in Germany, with an establishment in the UK. It is the successor entity to Sanden International Europe (Ltd) (SIE), which was incorporated in the UK.
The anchor defendants who were served within the jurisdiction, for the purposes of the jurisdictional gateways, were therefore the first and fifth defendants (from the DENSO group), as well as the thirteenth defendant (from the Sanden group). The remaining defendants are all service-out defendants; these include all of the Valeo defendants.
The Commission Decision and decisions of other regulators
The Commission Decision (which was a settlement decision) found four separate infringements of Article 101 TFEU and Article 53 of the EEA agreement, concerning the supply of TSCs for cars in the EEA, as follows:
infringement 1: coordination between undertakings in the DENSO, Valeo and Mahle-Behr groups, concerning supplies of heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning units (HVACs) to Volkswagen, Daimler and BMW, between 2005 and 2009;
infringement 2: coordination between undertakings in the DENSO, Valeo and Sanden groups, concerning supplies of compressors to Volkswagen and PAG, between 2004 and 2009;
infringement 3: coordination between undertakings in the Panasonic and DENSO groups, concerning supplies of e-compressors to Nissan/Renault, between May and October 2009;
infringement 4: coordination between undertakings in the DENSO, Calsonic, Sanden and Valeo groups, concerning supplies of HVACs, radiators and fans to Suzuki, between 2007 and 2009.
The addressees of the Commission Decision included all of the remaining defendants to the present proceedings, save for the fifth defendant, which was not an addressee.
The claimants also rely on the materials from other overseas regulators to support their case that the cartel conduct went beyond that found in the Commission Decision, and that the claimants were amongst the car manufacturers targeted by the cartel. Particular reliance is placed on the investigation of CADE in Brazil, where the companies under investigation included companies within the DENSO and Valeo groups. Although those proceedings concluded with a judgment finding by a majority that the infringement had not been proven beyond a reasonable doubt (the relevant standard of proof) against DENSO, the claimants rely (among other things) on the existence of settlements and leniency agreements concluded with the other companies, including Valeo.
Further investigations and decisions relied on by the claimants include:
an investigation by the US Department of Justice, which resulted in the second and tenth defendants signing plea agreements admitting their participation in anticompetitive conduct related to the manufacture and sale of certain HVAC components and air conditioning systems;
a decision of the Japanese Fair Trade Commission, finding that the second defendant had conspired in procurements of automotive radiators and electrical fans supplied to non-claimant companies;
a decision of the South Korean Fair Trade Commission, finding that the second defendant and another company had engaged in bid-rigging in relation to the supply of compressors (again in relation to a non-claimant company);
a decision of the Mexican Federal Economic Competition Commission, which also found that the second defendant had engaged in anti-competitive conduct in relation to the supply of compressors;
an investigation by the South African Competition Commission, resulting in consent agreements being entered into with various companies who were alleged to have entered into anti-competitive agreements involving DENSO; and
an investigation by the Indonesian Competition Commission, which resulted in companies in the DENSO and Sanden groups entering into a settlement agreement admitting anticompetitive conduct in relation to the supply of an air-conditioning system to a non-claimant company.
The Commission Decision was one of a number of decisions adopted by the Commission concerning anticompetitive conduct in relation to the supply of car parts. The claimants do not rely on those other decisions in relation to the substance of their claim in these proceedings. For the purposes of the jurisdiction challenges, however, the claimants rely on the fact that the first ten claimants have brought an earlier claim in this jurisdiction against different defendants, Stellantis Auto v Autoliv, on the basis of two decisions of the Commission concerning the supply of occupant safety system components. The Stellantis Auto v Autoliv proceedings were commenced prior to Exit Day under the Brexit withdrawal arrangements, were therefore subject to the jurisdictional rules under the Brussels I Regulation, and no jurisdiction challenge was brought by the defendants. The trial of that claim took place in the Competition Appeal Tribunal in October 2024, with judgment pending.
The claims
The Commission Decision did not find that the addressees coordinated their conduct in respect of TSC supplies to the claimants, and did not find an infringement in relation to all of the products covered by the present claim. The claim in these proceedings is therefore not based, directly, on the infringements found in the decision. Instead the claimants advance their claim on two alternative bases. First, the claim alleges that the defendants’ anticompetitive conduct extended to supplies to the claimants, and to further products not covered by the Commission Decision (relying, as noted above, on investigations and decisions by other overseas regulators). Secondly, the claimants advance an “umbrella damages” claim, alleging that even if there was no such wider infringement, the infringements that were found by the Commission (in relation to supplies to other car manufacturers) led to an increase in the prices of TSCs purchased by the claimants from the defendants.
The original claim form alleged a cartel which covered the period from 2004 to 2009, coextensive with the period covered by the four infringements found in the Commission Decision (between them), and confined to the products covered by the Decision. The claim also pleaded an unspecified period following the cartel during which prices were said to have continued to be inflated by reason of the cartel.
Prior to service of the claim form, however, the claimants amended the claim form three times: on 20 June 2022, 29 June 2022 and 25 April 2023. The re-re-amended claim form alleges a cartel period spanning 1999 to 2011, again with a further period thereafter during which prices are said to have been affected by the cartel. (The particulars of claim define this “overhang period” as lasting until “at least 2016”.) The re-re-amended claim form also introduces claims in relation to products not covered by the Commission Decision, namely condensers, intercoolers and oil coolers, and adds the two Brazilian claimants, who were not listed as claimants in the original claim form.
The claim is advanced on the basis of the law of England and Wales, on the grounds that there is said to be no material difference between that and any other governing law. The claimants accept, however, that such a difference may arise in relation to limitation arguments, and in that respect contend that the claims are governed by German law (OV claimants), French law (PSA claimants), Italian law (FCA claimants) and Brazilian law (Brazilian claimants).
The claimants’ position is that under German, French and Italian law the limitation period was five years from the date of publication of the summary of the Commission Decision, such that it expired on 30 May 2022. The position under Brazilian law is not entirely clear, but the claimants’ position is that the period is five years from the “unequivocal acknowledgement of the unlawful act”, which would arguably take the period to 8 March 2022, based on the date of the Commission Decision. In so far as domestic law is or might be relevant to limitation, the period is six years from the point when the claimants could have had a reasonable belief that there had been a cartel (Gemalto v Infineon [2022] EWCA Civ 782, [2023] Ch 169, §53). It does not appear to be seriously disputed that that period started running no later than the date of the Commission Decision, and therefore expired no later than 8 March 2023.
A final point to note regarding the claims is that the OV claimants do not pursue any claims against DENSO. In addition, as a result of a settlement agreement entered into between General Motors and Valeo, the OV claimants do not pursue any claims in respect of purchases from Valeo up to 10 March 2016 (the Valeo settlement agreement). General Motors also entered into a settlement agreement with Sanden on 24 June 2015 (the 2015 Sanden settlement agreement). Given the subsequent Sanden settlement agreement concluded with all of the claimants, the 2015 Sanden settlement agreement is no longer relevant to Sanden itself. The 2015 agreement does, however, remain of relevance for the application of the jurisdictional gateways to the remaining claims of the OV claimants against Valeo, for the reasons given further below.
On 11 July 2024 Valeo asked the claimants to provide draft amended particulars of claim reflecting the settlement between General Motors and Valeo. A draft was provided by the claimants on 19 July 2024.
Procedural background
The claim form was issued on 7 March 2022, at the time making claims against defendants from all six of the manufacturing groups addressed by the Commission Decision. Pursuant to CPR 7.4(2) and (5), the claim form and particulars of claim should have been served on the service-in defendants by 7 July 2022, and on the service-out defendants by 7 September 2022. Between April and June 2022, however, consent orders were agreed extending time for service on all of the defendants, save for the Panasonic defendant which settled with the claimants in May 2022. The consent orders gave the claimants until 1 September 2023 to serve the claims (and particulars of claim).
In April 2023 the claimants settled with the Calsonic defendants. Not having reached settlement agreements with any of the other defendants, the claimants then decided to serve the proceedings, and sought further extensions of time to do so. DENSO and Sanden agreed extensions of time to 1 January 2024; the Valeo and Mahle-Behr defendants did not.
The claimants therefore applied for an extension of time for service on Valeo and Mahle-Behr, in the same application in which permission for service out was sought. On 15 May 2023 Deputy Master Smith granted the claimants permission to serve out, and also granted an extension of time for service on Valeo and Mahle-Behr, to 1 January 2024. On 17 May 2023 those orders, together with the re-re-amended claim form and particulars of claim, were sent to the defendants by email for information (albeit not of course constituting formal service on the service-out defendants).
On 9 June 2023 the claimants’ service packs for service on the service-out defendants were deposited at the Foreign Process Section of the High Court. The proceedings were served on Mahle-Behr in Germany in August 2023, but the claim against Mahle-Behr was then settled in September 2023.
On 12 September 2023 the proceedings were served on all three of the service-in defendants, i.e. the first and fifth defendants (in the DENSO group) and the thirteenth defendant (in the Sanden group). The proceedings were then served on the service-out defendants over the course of the next six months, via the Foreign Process Section and the authorities of the relevant countries. The Valeo defendants were served in France, Germany and Japan on various dates between 20 September 2023 and 8 December 2023. On the same date, DENSO agreed a further extension of time for service of proceedings on the third defendant (DENSO Europe BV) to 1 April 2024. The third defendant was eventually served in the Netherlands on 18 March 2024; it was the last of the service-out defendants to be served.
Between 26 September 2023 and 2 April 2024, the DENSO, Valeo and Sanden defendants all filed acknowledgements of service indicating an intention to contest jurisdiction. The defendants’ applications contesting jurisdiction were then filed on various dates between 30 November 2023 and 2 April 2024.
In addition, the DENSO and Valeo defendants (but not the Sanden defendants) filed applications seeking to set aside the amendments made by the claimants to the claim form prior to service, and to strike out parts of the particulars of claim that go beyond the scope of the re-re-amended claim form (the amendment applications). The basis for the applications is that the claimants’ amendments purport to bring new claims outside the limitation period. The amendment applications of DENSO and Valeo, if successful, would have the effect (among other things) of removing the Brazilian claimants from the claim.
Those applications are not before the court in this hearing, but are due to be determined at a later date if necessary, subject to one point: DENSO and Valeo say that if the court were to find against them on the issues in this hearing by finding material supplies by them during the extended period now relied upon by the claimants, or by reference to the claims by the Brazilian claimants, then the appropriate course would be to adjourn the final determination of the jurisdiction challenges to the hearing of the amendment applications, or to make a contingent order. That situation does not arise given the terms of my judgment set out below.
Issues
The defendants’ applications raise the following issues:
Should the extension of time for service on Valeo be set aside, leading to the dismissal of the claim against Valeo?
What are the applicable jurisdictional gateways for the claims?
Should the order permitting service out be set aside (in relation to the service-out defendants), and jurisdiction declined (in relation to the service-in defendants), on forum non conveniens grounds?
The defendants’ position is that the claims should be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction irrespective of whether the amendments to the claim form are permitted, and irrespective of whether the particulars of claim are allowed to stand in their present form, and that it will therefore ultimately not be necessary to determine the amendment applications.
Relevant legal principles
Extension of time under CPR r. 7.6(2)
CPR r. 7.5(2) provides that where the claim form is served within the jurisdiction, the defendant must be served in accordance with the rules in CPR Part 6 section IV, within six months of the date of issue.
CPR r. 7.6 permits the claimant to apply to extend that period, as follows:
The claimant may apply for an order extending the period for compliance with rule 7.5.
The general rule is that an application to extend the time for compliance with rule 7.5 must be made –
within the period specified by rule 7.5; or
where an order has been made under this rule, within the period for service specified by that order.
If the claimant applies for an order to extend the time for compliance after the end of the period specified by rule 7.5 or by an order made under this rule, the court may make such an order only if –
the court has failed to serve the claim form; or
the claimant has taken all reasonable steps to comply with rule 7.5 but has been unable to do so; and
in either case, the claimant has acted promptly in making the application.
An application for an order extending the time for compliance with rule 7.5 –
must be supported by evidence; and
may be made without notice.”
PD 7A sets out the evidence required for an application under r. 7.6:
An application under rule 7.6 (for an extension of time for serving a claim form under rule 7.6(1)) must be made in accordance with Part 23 and supported by evidence.
The evidence should state –
all the circumstances relied on,
the date of issue of the claim,
the expiry date of any rule 7.6 extension, and
a full explanation as to why the claim has not been served.”
The conditions for the grant of an extension of time are thus less stringent for an application made in time under r. 7.6(2) than for an application made out of time under r. 7.6(3). For an application made out of time, where it is the claimant rather than the court which has failed to serve the claim form, the extension of time may only be granted where the court is satisfied that all three conditions set out in r. 7.6(3) are satisfied, and in particular that the claimant has taken all reasonable steps to serve in time, but has been unable to do so. By contrast, where the application is made within time, those conditions are not specified, and the claimant is therefore not required to show that it has taken all reasonable steps to serve within time. Rather, the court’s power to extend the time must be exercised in accordance with the overriding objective: Hashtroodi v Hancock [2004] EWCA Civ 652, [2004] 1 WLR 3206, §§17–18; Al-Zahra v DDM [2019] EWCA Civ 1103, §49.
The following considerations emerge from the authorities as to the considerations which are relevant in the exercise of the court’s discretion in the application of r. 7.6(2):
It follows from the overriding objective that civil litigation should be undertaken and pursued with proper expedition. Parties are therefore required to progress their proceedings promptly and within the specified time limits: see Vinos v Marks & Spencer [2000] 3 All ER 784, §20. Until the claim form is served, the court has no influence over the proceedings and cannot ensure that cases are dealt with expeditiously and fairly. The service of the claim form is therefore essential in order to (i) notify the defendant that the claimant has embarked on the formal process of litigation; (ii) enable the defendant to participate in the litigation; and (iii) enable the court to control the litigation: Hoddinott v Persimmon Homes (Wessex) [2007] EWCA Civ 1203, [2008] 1 WLR 806, §54.
It will always be relevant for the court to determine and evaluate the reason why the claimant did not serve the claim form within the specified period: Hashtroodi, §18. What may be a sufficient reason for an extension of time for service of particulars of claim may not necessarily be a sufficient reason for an extension for service of the claim form: ST v BAI [2022] EWCA Civ 1037, §62(ii).
If there is a very good reason for the failure to serve within time, then an extension of time will usually be granted. By contrast, the court is unlikely to grant an extension of time if no good reason has been shown for the failure to serve within the relevant period: Hashtroodi, §18; Hoddinott, §54; ST v BAI, §62(ii) and (iii).
In general, the reason for seeking an extension of time must be a genuine difficulty in serving within time, rather than the consequences of the claimant’s own neglect: Hashtroodi, §18; and Cecil v Bayat [2011] EWCA Civ 135, §49. The claimant’s own delay in preparing its case, such as a delay in drafting the particulars of claim, is therefore not a good reason for an extension of time: Euro-Asian Oil v Abilo [2013] EWHC 485 (Comm), §37.
While an extension of time might be justified to enable the claimant to avoid the expense of serving out in circumstances where there is “real and substantial progress in settlement negotiations”, it is not sufficient for the claimant to say that it is waiting for the defendants to make or accept an offer of settlement: The Hai Hing [2000] 1 Lloyds Rep 300, pp. 308–309; Euro-Asian Oil, §28; and see ST v BAI, §62(ii).
It is important to consider whether the limitation period has or may have expired since the commencement of proceedings, such that the extension of time would or may deprive the defendant of a limitation defence. If that is the case the claimant should show, at the very least, that it has taken reasonable steps to effect service, and that an extension of time is justified by factors which are, either separately or cumulatively, “out of the ordinary”: Cecil v Bayat, §48; ST v BAI, §§62(iv) and 63.
If the claim form has been sent to the defendant such that it has brought to the defendant’s attention the nature of the claims, that is a factor relevant to the court’s discretion under r. 7.6(2), even if sending a copy of the claim form did not constitute service: Hoddinott, §57. In Cecil v Bayat at §88, Rix LJ characterised Hoddinott as an “exceptional” case where the defendant had received the claim form (even if not by formal service) within the period for service and the claim was still well within its limitation period, such that the defendant suffered no prejudice by reason of the extension of time. He noted, however, that in the great majority of cases an extension would only be granted where a good reason has been supplied.
Service out of the jurisdiction under CPR rr. 6.36 and 6.37
Following Brexit, service out of the jurisdiction on the service-out defendants is governed by CPR rr. 6.36 and 6.37, requiring the permission of the court and the application of one or more of the grounds, generally referred to “gateways”, set out in CPR PD 6B, §3.1. In the present case the gateways relied upon by the claimants are gateways 3, 9(a) and 9(b). These provide as follows:
A claim is made against a person (‘the defendant’) on whom the claim form has been and will be served (otherwise than in reliance on this paragraph) and –
there is between the claimant and the defendant a real issue which it is reasonable for the court to try; and
the claimant wishes to serve the claim form on another person who is a necessary and proper party to that claim.
…
A claim is made in tort where –
damage was sustained, or will be sustained, within the jurisdiction;
damage which has been or will be sustained results from an act committed, or likely to be committed, within the jurisdiction;”
The relevant principles applicable to service out under CPR Part 6 were set out by Lloyd LJ in VTB Capital v Nutritek [2012] EWCA Civ 808, §§99–100 (endorsed by Lord Clarke in the Supreme Court in the same case, [2013] UKSC 5, [2013] 2 AC 337, at §164), as follows:
… The three basic principles were recently restated by Lord Collins of Mapesbury in giving the advice of the Privy Council in AK Investment CJSC v Kyrgyz Mobile Tel Ltd [2012] 1 WLR 1804, paras 71, 81 and 88. They can be summarised as follows: first, the claimant must satisfy the court that, in relation to the foreign defendant to be served with the proceedings, there is a serious issue to be tried on the merits of the claim, i.e. a substantial question of fact or law or both. This means that there has to be a real, as opposed to a fanciful, prospect of success on the claim. Secondly, the claimant must satisfy the court that there is a good arguable case that the claim against the foreign defendant falls within one or more of the classes of case for which leave to serve out of the jurisdiction may be given. These are now set out in paragraph 3.1 of Practice Direction 6B. ‘Good arguable case’ in this context means that the claimant has a much better argument than the foreign defendant. Further, where a question of law arises in connection with a dispute about service out of the jurisdiction and that question of law goes to the existence of the jurisdiction (eg whether a claim falls within one of the classes set out in paragraph 3.1 of Practice Direction 6B), then the court will normally decide the question of law, as opposed to seeing whether there is a good arguable case on that issue of law.
Thirdly, the claimant must satisfy the court that in all the circumstances England is clearly or distinctly the appropriate forum for the trial of the dispute and that in all the circumstances the court ought to exercise its discretion to permit service of the proceedings out of the jurisdiction. This requirement is reflected in rule 6.37(3) of the CPR, which provides that ‘The court will not give permission [to serve a claim form out of the jurisdiction on any of the grounds set out in paragraph 3.1 of Practice Direction 6B] unless satisfied that England and Wales is the proper place in which to bring the claim’”.
The first of those three principles (serious issue to be tried) needs no further explanation. The third principle is the forum conveniens rule which I consider separately below.
In relation to the second principle, the application of the standard of “good arguable case” in this context was explained by Lord Sumption in Brownlie v Four Seasons Holdings [2017] UKSC 80. After referring at §7 to the observation of the Court of Appeal in Canada Trust v Stolzenberg (No. 2) [1998] 1 WLR 547, p. 555, that “good arguable case” reflects that “one side has a much better argument on the material available”, Lord Sumption continued:
“The reference to ‘a much better argument on the material available’ is not a reversion to the civil burden of proof … What is meant is (i) that the claimant must supply a plausible evidential basis for the application of a relevant jurisdictional gateway; (ii) that if there is an issue of fact about it, or some other reason for doubting whether it applies, the Court must take a view on the material available if it can reliably do so; but (iii) the nature of the issue and the limitations of the material available at the interlocutory stage may be such that no reliable assessment can be made, in which case there is a good arguable case for the application of the gateway if there is a plausible (albeit contested) evidential basis for it. I do not believe that anything is gained by the word ‘much’, which suggests a superior standard of conviction that is both uncertain and unwarranted in this context.”
That formulation was repeated by Lord Sumption in Goldman Sachs v Novo Banco [2018] UKSC 34, §9. In Kaefer Aislamientos v AMS Drilling Mexico [2019] EWCA Civ 10, Green LJ considered the application of the three limbs of the Brownlie formulation. His comments may be summarised as follows:
Brownie limb (i) is a reference to an evidential basis showing that the claimant has the better argument – in other words the relative test in Canada Trust. It is, however, not necessary to show that the claimant has “much” the better argument. Moreover, in expressing a view on jurisdiction, the court must be astute not to express any view on the ultimate merits of the case, even if there is a close overlap between the issues going to jurisdiction and the ultimate substantive merits (§§73–77).
Brownlie limb (ii) requires the court to overcome evidential difficulties and arrive at a conclusion if it reliably can, recognising that jurisdiction challenges are invariably interim and will be characterised by gaps in the evidence. It is an instruction to use “judicial common sense and pragmatism”, not least because the exercise is intended to be one conducted with “due despatch and without hearing oral evidence” (§78).
Brownlie limb (iii) addresses the situation where the court is unable to form a decided conclusion on the evidence before it as to who has the better argument. In that situation, limb (iii) moves away from a relative test and instead introduces a test combining good arguable case and plausibility of evidence. That is a more flexible test which is not necessarily conditional upon relative merits (§§79–80).
Green LJ thereby recognised that jurisdiction challenges are interim, and are likely to be determined in the context of evidential gaps and without hearing oral evidence. In that context, the court should, in principle, attempt to reach a view on whether the claimant has the better argument, recognising the limitations of the material before it. There may, however, be a situation where, despite best endeavours, the material before the court is too finely balanced, or too inconclusive, for the court to reach a conclusion one way or the other as to the relative strength of the parties’ cases. In such a case the court may determine a good arguable case on the basis of an assessment of whether there is, at least, a plausible evidential basis for the application of the relevant jurisdictional gateway.
Forum conveniens
The forum conveniens principles set out in the well-known judgment of Lord Goff in Spiliada Maritime Corp v Cansulex (The Spiliada) [1987] AC 460 apply both to the question of whether to permit service outside the jurisdiction in relation to service-out defendants, and whether to decline jurisdiction in relation to service-in defendants. Those principles have been the subject of considerable further commentary in more recent case-law. For present purposes the relevant principles can be summarised as follows:
In service-in cases, the burden is on the defendant to show that England and Wales is not the natural or appropriate forum for the trial, and that there is another available forum which is clearly or distinctly more appropriate, or which in other words is the “natural forum” for the trial of the action. If the court is satisfied that there is another available forum which is prima facie the appropriate forum, the burden shifts to the claimant to show that there are special circumstances by reason of which justice requires that the trial should nevertheless take place in this country: Spiliada pp. 476–478.
In service-out cases, the burden is on the claimant to show that England and Wales is clearly or distinctly the most appropriate forum. It is not sufficient to show that it is one of several equally suitable available fora: Gulfvin Investment v Tahrir Petrochemicals [2022] EWHC 1040 (Comm), [2022] 4 WLR 66, §§18–22.
Where there are multiple defendants, some of which have been served without the need for permission and some with permission, the court is in essence looking for a single jurisdiction in which the claims against all the defendants may, as a whole, most suitably be tried: Lungowe v Vedanta Resources [2019] UKSC 20, [2020] AC 1045, §68; Mercedes-Benz v Continental Teves [2023] EWHC 1143 (Comm), [2023] 5 CMLR 21, §22.
In seeking to establish the appropriate forum for the litigation, the court should consider the forum with which the action has “the most real and substantial connection”: Spiliada p. 478; Lungowe §66.
Relevant factors will include the location of witnesses and documents, and their language, consideration of the places where the parties reside or carry on business, the place where the wrongful act or omission occurred, and the place where the harm occurred: Spiliada p. 478; Lungowe §66.
It is generally preferable, other things being equal, that a case should be tried in the country whose law applies. That factor carries particular force if issues of law are likely to be important and there is evidence of relevant differences in the legal principles between the different competing fora: VTB Capital v Nutritek, [2013] UKSC 5, §46.
In cases involving questions of EU law, the fact that the courts of England and Wales can no longer make references to the CJEU may be a factor pointing to the courts of an EU State, and away from England and Wales as the appropriate forum: Mercedes-Benz v Continental Teves [2023] EWHC 1143 (Comm), [2023] 5 CMLR 21, §§55–57.
It may be relevant that the legal teams and experts in one jurisdiction have built up a substantial bank of knowledge and expertise relevant to the claims (the so-called “Cambridgeshire” factor): Spiliada pp. 485–486. But it is not sufficient simply to assert that the same firms of solicitors have been acting for the parties for some time: Samsung Electronics v LG [2022] EWCA Civ 423, §32.
In considering whether there are special circumstances requiring a stay not to be granted notwithstanding the conclusion that another forum is prima facie more appropriate, one factor may be cogent evidence establishing that the claimant will not obtain justice in the foreign jurisdiction: Spiliada p. 478.
Procedural differences such as differences in disclosure rules in different jurisdictions are, however, generally not reasons making it unjust to stay proceedings in this jurisdiction: Spiliada pp. 482–483.
If a claimant would be out of time in the foreign jurisdiction, and did not act unreasonably by failing to issue protective proceedings in that forum, that does not render the foreign jurisdiction “unavailable”, but may be a reason why it would be unjust to stay the domestic proceedings. It will be relevant to consider the claimant’s awareness of the time-bar and the explanation for its failure to issue protective proceedings: see Spiliada pp. 483–484; Citi-March v Neptune Orient Lines [1996] 1 WLR 1367, p. 1374. If the claimant has acted reasonably in commencing proceedings in England and Wales, and in allowing time to expire in the relevant foreign jurisdiction, a stay (or set-aside of service) should only be granted on terms the defendant waives the time-bar in the foreign jurisdiction, assuming it can do so: Baghlaf Al Safer v Pakistan National Shipping [1998] CLC 716, p. 727; and see also Spiliada p. 484.
Mr Moser KC, for DENSO, submitted in his skeleton argument that it is not necessary for the court to identify a single alternative forum to England and Wales which would be the most appropriate of the available alternative fora, provided that the court can identify at least one other available forum that would be more appropriate than England and Wales. He relied in this regard on a passage at fn 109 of Dicey, Morris & Collins on the Conflict of Laws (16th ed, 2022), suggesting that if there are two fora which are both more appropriate than England and Wales, a stay may be granted even if it cannot be said that one is more appropriate than the other.
This question was considered by Michael Green QC (as he then was) in Wilton Trustees v AFS Trustee et al, BVIHC (COM) 2018/154, who concluded that the defendants “must nail their colours to the mast of one jurisdiction which they can prove is the appropriate forum”, for their applications for a stay on grounds of forum non conveniens to succeed (§42). He concluded that the defendants had not shown that there was another jurisdiction which was “the appropriate forum” for the trial of the action (§91). Happily, however, I do not need to reach a view on this point for the purposes of these proceedings, because by the time of the hearing the defendants all took the position that the most appropriate forum for the claims was France.
Change of circumstances after service out
As already indicated, it will be necessary in this judgment to consider the effect of the settlement of all of the claims against Sanden on the remaining claims pursued against DENSO and Valeo. In that regard, the established position is that an application to set aside permission to serve out of the jurisdiction falls to be determined by reference to the position at the time permission was granted, even if the circumstances have changed by the time that the application to set aside is heard: Erste Group v Red October [2015] 1 CLC 706 (CA), §§44–45, citing Hoffmann J in ISC v Guerin [1992] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 430 at pp. 434–435, and Mohammed v Bank of Kuwait [1996] 1 WLR 1483.
In an obiter comment in BMG Trading v McKay [1998] IL Pr 691, §9, Phillips LJ expressed “reservations” with that proposition, in circumstances where an anchor defendant had fallen away between the grant of permission to serve out and the application to set aside the grant of permission. Ultimately, however, he did not need to decide the point because the defendants based their challenge to jurisdiction on other grounds. I do not consider that this obiter comment is a sufficient basis to depart from the principle set out in the ISC v Guerin line of authorities.
The position is different for the forum non conveniens arguments. Those must be determined on the basis of the position as it now is. The claimants disputed that proposition in their October/November 2024 submissions, relying on Hoffmann J’s comment in ISC v Guerin (p. 434) that forum non conveniens should be decided on the facts as they stood as at “the date of the hearing”. Evans LJ reached the same conclusion in Mohammed v Bank of Kuwait (p. 1492). The claimants contended that the applications for a stay on grounds of forum non conveniens should therefore be determined on the basis of the facts as they stood at the time of the hearing (i.e. in this case in July 2024) and that the Sanden settlement should accordingly be disregarded.
I do not accept that submission. The purpose of the comments in both ISC v Guerin and Mohammed v Bank of Kuwait was to draw a distinction between an application to set aside permission to serve out and an application for the stay of the proceedings, in circumstances where further evidence had been received between the order for service out and the application to discharge that order. The point was to emphasise that the question of a stay on grounds of forum non conveniens must be determined on the basis of the circumstances as at the time of the court’s decision on the application. As Evans LJ commented in Mohammed v Bank of Kuwait, “Where a stay is applied for, i.e. for the future, I would hold that the court should also have regard to the situation at the date of the hearing if only to avoid the absurdity of ordering a stay which is patently unjust through a chance of circumstances” (p. 1493).
That was the way the matter was put by Cooke J in Credit Agricole v Unicof [2003] EWHC 2676 (Comm), [2004] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 196, commenting at §22:
“In contradistinction to the application to set aside proceedings which, as was common ground, has to be approached on the basis of the circumstances existing when permission was given … an alternative application to stay falls to be considered at the time of the determination of the application: see ISC Technologies v Guerin [1992] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 430 at pages 434–5 and Mohammed v Bank of Kuwait [1996] 1 WLR 1483 at pages 1492–3.”
It follows that if, after the hearing of a stay application but before judgment is handed down by the court, the court is informed by the parties of a material change of circumstances such as a settlement with one or more of the defendants, it would be wrong and indeed absurd for the court to be required to shut its eyes to that fact, and decide the case as if that settlement had not been reached and the relevant defendant group was still within the claim. Nor is there any principled reason why the court should ignore a clearly relevant fact.
That does not (contrary to the claimants’ submissions) discourage amicable settlements. It simply recognises that the fact of a settlement is something that will inevitably have to be taken into account in the determination of the appropriate forum for the hearing; and that remains the case if the settlement happens to be agreed between the date of the hearing and the handing down of final judgment. There is no sensible reason why a settlement agreement concluded on the day before the hearing should be treated any differently from a settlement agreement concluded on the day after the hearing, if (as in the present case) judgment is not handed down until some months after the hearing.
The fact that the claims are no longer being pursued against the Sanden defendants is therefore undoubtedly a factor to be taken into account in determining the global question of where the remaining claims may most suitably be tried. The question of the admission of further evidence by the claimants following documents obtained pursuant to the Sanden settlement agreement is, however, a different matter: that evidence does not concern a change of circumstances since the hearing, but rather concerns the admission of further contemporaneous documents dating from the period of the alleged cartel. I will consider that issue separately below.
Extension of time for service on Valeo
The parties’ submissions
The extension of time issue applies only to Valeo, the other defendants having consented to extensions of time to 1 January 2024 and (in the case of the third defendant) 1 April 2024.
In respect of Valeo, the extension of time agreed by consent expired on 1 September 2023, and Valeo did not thereafter consent to a further extension of time. Without the extension of time granted on 11 May 2023, therefore, the claimants would have had to reissue their claims. By then the limitation period under domestic law (to the extent that is relevant) had expired; and on the claimants’ own case the limitation periods under French, German, Italian and Brazilian law had also expired. Valeo would therefore have been entitled to defend any reissued claim on the basis that it was time-barred. That does not appear to be disputed by the claimants.
On that basis the claimants have to show that they had taken reasonable steps to effect service, and that there was a good reason for their failure to serve within the agreed extended time period based on factors that were out of the ordinary.
The claimants say that they did take steps to commence the process of service out prior to the 1 September 2023 deadline, and that they were justified in waiting to take those steps in light of their attempts to reach settlements with the various defendants. Valeo objects that service could easily have been effected prior to the deadline if the claimants had taken the steps to do so earlier, and says that there were in fact no settlement discussions between the claimants and Valeo between issue of the claim form and the 11 May 2023 extension order. Valeo also contends that there were material and non-innocent breaches of the duty of full and frank disclosure by the claimants in seeking that extension order.
Steps taken to effect service
The claim form was issued on 7 March 2022. On the claimants’ own evidence, they did not decide to serve the proceedings until April 2023, the decision to (finally) serve being taken on the basis that settlements had not been concluded with any of the defendants other than Calsonic and Panasonic. Prior to that date, it is apparent that no steps at all were taken by the claimants to serve the proceedings.
The claimants did, after their decision to serve, then take steps to do so by serving the service-in defendants, and preparing service packs for service on the service-out defendants, depositing them at the Foreign Process Section of the High Court. By then, however, the latter steps were too late, as it was very unlikely that the service-out defendants would be served within the original 1 September 2023 deadline (as proved, in fact, to be the case: the service-out defendants were eventually served between 20 September 2023 and 18 March 2024).
Mr West KC, for the claimants, said that it was sufficient that steps were taken to serve prior to the 1 September 2023 deadline. He relied on the judgment of Teare J in JSC BTA Bank v Ablyazov [2011] EWHC 2988 (Comm), upholding an order extending time for service on the second defendant in Russia. In that case, prior to the expiry of validity of the claim form, the claimant had commenced the process of preparing notarised translations of the relevant documents, which were then delivered to the Foreign Process Section shortly after the claim form would have (but for the extension of time) expired. The judge considered that there was a good reason to extend time, namely the long period of time required to effect service in Russia, notwithstanding a delay of “a month or more” in commencing the process of preparing the notarised translations for service out of the jurisdiction (§§28–29).
The circumstances of that case were, however, very different to the present case. At the time the claim form was issued, the claimants believed that they would be able to serve in the jurisdiction on the second defendant’s solicitors, Olswang, who were instructed by the second defendant in several other related proceedings. The claimant repeatedly asked Olswang whether they were instructed to accept service of the new proceedings on behalf of the second defendant. It was only two and a half months later that the claimants were informed by Olswang that they were not instructed to accept service. Teare J considered that until that point the claimant had a good reason for not serving out on the second defendant (§24). Thereafter, he thought that the claimant should have taken steps to serve, notwithstanding the fact that without prejudice discussions were ongoing between the claimant and the second defendant (§28). He noted, however, that although there had been a delay of a month or more in commencing the process by the claimant, an extension of time would inevitably have been needed because of the very much longer period of time required to effect service in Russia (§§28–30).
In the present case, the delay in commencing the process of serving out of the jurisdiction was not a matter of months, but was more than a year. It is difficult to see how on any basis that can be regarded as the taking of reasonable steps to effect service, having regard to the requirement to progress litigation expeditiously. Moreover, unlike the Ablyazov case, this is not a case where it is apparent that a further lengthy extension of time would have been needed in any event for service out of the jurisdiction on the Valeo defendants. Those defendants were all served on 8 December 2023, within six months of the service packs being deposited at the Foreign Process Section. The extensions of time initially agreed by the defendants had given the claimants almost 18 months to serve the proceedings. There is no suggestion in the evidence that the proceedings could not have been served on the Valeo defendants within that period, if reasonable steps had been taken to do so from the outset.
Reasons for the delay
Nor is there, in my judgment, any good reason for the claimants’ delay. I will start with the reasons given in the claimants’ evidence in support of their May 2023 application for an extension of time for service on Valeo and Mahle-Behr, in the form of a witness statement from Mr Bolster, a partner at Hausfeld, the claimants’ solicitors. Valeo contends that the evidence given in that witness statement was undermined by material non-disclosures. I do not, however, need to reach any view on that because it is in my judgment clear that the reasons given by Mr Bolster were, on their face, simply not good enough to justify the extension of time sought.
The first reason was that the claimants had had to prepare particulars of claim to be served within the period of validity of the claim form. That was not, in itself, a reason why the claimants could not serve proceedings by 1 September 2023. The extended time period agreed with the defendants had given the claimants ample time to prepare those particulars following issue of the claim form.
The second reason was that there had been backlogs caused by a cyber-attack on Royal Mail in early 2023, affecting its overseas delivery services, which might lead the Foreign Process Section to take several months to dispatch the documents for service to the relevant foreign authorities. It is clear, however, that this was not the real reason why the claimants were unable to serve by 1 September 2023. The cyber-attack did not occur until mid-January 2023, over nine months after the claim form was issued. Had reasonable steps been taken to serve the proceedings after issue of the claim form, there is no reason why the documents for service could not have been deposited with the Foreign Process Section long before the cyber-attack occurred. There is no explanation at all (let alone a good explanation) of why a delay of a few months, which might have arisen from the cyber-attack, prevented service of proceedings in the 18-month period between issue of the claim form and the extended deadline of 1 September 2023.
The third reason was that service on Valeo and Mahle-Behr in France and Germany might take around three months from receipt of the documents by the French and German authorities, and that Hausfeld had been told that the average time for service in Japan was four months from receipt of the documents by the Japanese authorities (but that Mr Bolster understood that it might take longer). Again, however, there is no reason why those periods could not have been accommodated within the extended service period agreed by the defendants, had reasonable steps been taken to commence service promptly after issue of the claim form.
The final reason given was that the other defendants had consented to an extension of time for service to 1 January 2024, and that the extension would align the dates for service on all of the defendants which would simplify the subsequent steps in the proceedings. That is manifestly not a reason why service by 1 September 2023 was “unlikely to be possible”. Indeed, it is not a coherent reason for an extension of time on any basis. Given that the defendants were being served in a variety of different jurisdictions, by different authorities, the alignment of the deadlines for service could not ensure that the dates of actual service on the various defendants were aligned. Nor would that have been a good reason for an extension of time in any event, given that it was perfectly possible for the parties to agree a timetable for subsequent procedural steps to ensure efficient case management, once the defendants had all been served (as in fact occurred).
The real reason that the claimants needed an extension of time was therefore not the reasons given in the claimants’ May 2023 evidence, but rather the fact that the claimants had decided not to take steps to serve proceedings until April 2023. That was a matter wholly within the claimants’ control. As the authorities cited above make clear, a claimant’s own delay in preparing its case and commencing steps for service is not a good reason for an extension of time.
Mr West said that the reason why the claimants waited to start the process of service on the defendants was that they were endeavouring to resolve the proceedings without formal litigation, in circumstances where there were ongoing settlement discussions with the defendants, which did in fact lead to settlements with Panasonic and Calsonic before the claim form was served on them (and with Mahle-Behr shortly after it was served). At the hearing, however, Mr Kennelly KC, for Valeo, disputed the existence of any settlement discussions with Valeo specifically. Further evidence on this was therefore provided after the hearing, in the form of witness statements from Mr Bolster, for the claimants, and Mr Bock, a partner at Cleary Gottlieb, Valeo’s solicitors.
It is apparent from that further evidence that there were no contacts between the claimants and Valeo that could properly be characterised as settlement discussions, in the period between issue of the claim form and 11 May 2023, the date of the extension of time order. What in fact happened was that:
Immediately following issue of the claim form, the claimants wrote (separately) to all of the defendants, informing them of the claim and proposing an extension of the period for service to 1 September 2023 to allow the parties to engage in settlement negotiations.
On 15 April 2022 an individual at Valeo heading the thermal system sales contacted his counterpart at Stellantis objecting to the claim and requesting that it be withdrawn. The Stellantis contact responded on 2 June 2022 informing him that any questions should be directed to Hausfeld.
On 13 June 2022 Valeo consented to the extension of time for service. It did not, however, engage in any settlement discussions with the claimants.
On 5 January 2023 the claimants sent a without prejudice letter to Valeo, providing a large volume of claimant sales data for the purposes of advancing settlement discussions. Valeo did not respond to that letter.
On 18 April 2023 there was a telephone call between Mr Bolster and Mr Bock, initiated by Mr Bolster, in which the claimants’ request for a further extension of time and the scope for settlement discussions was discussed. Mr Bolster made an attendance note of that call, which records Mr Bock’s position as being that Valeo was unlikely to agree a further extension of time for service. Mr Bolster apparently commented that the claimants were “still waiting to hear from [Valeo] on the data and that that is a normal starting point for [settlement] discussions”. It is common ground that this was a reference to the data provided in January 2023, and the fact that Valeo had not responded to that. Mr Bock’s response (according to the attendance note) was that Valeo was reluctant to do so as it considered the claim to be so “outlandish” in its scale as not to have any credibility.
There were no further discussions between the parties between that call and the 18 May 2023 extension order.
This was therefore not a case where there was “real and substantial progress” in settlement negotiations as between the claimants and Valeo, justifying the claimants holding back from incurring the expense of serving out of the jurisdiction. Nor, indeed, was there even any concrete offer of settlement on the table. Rather, the claimants were simply hoping that Valeo would respond to their (very preliminary) communications regarding the commencement of settlement discussions. It is apparent from Mr Bolster’s note of the April 2023 call that, as of the date of that call, Valeo had not yet done so. The claimants were therefore, during the period between issue of the claim form and the May 2023 extension order, simply hoping for Valeo to engage in settlement negotiations which did not, in the event, ever occur. That does not provide a sufficient justification for the claimants’ failure to take steps to serve on Valeo.
Finally, while Valeo was sent the claim form and particulars of claim for information on 17 May 2023, that does not in the circumstances of this case constitute a sufficient ground to grant an extension of time, given the expiry of the limitation period, the consequent prejudice to Valeo of being deprived of limitation defence, and the fact that there was (as I have found) no good reason for the claimant’s delay. Mr West submitted that Valeo’s objection to the extension of time was a purely technical one, since Valeo could be brought back in to the proceedings by way of a contribution notice. That is, however, not a basis for an extension of time to be given for service of the claim form where no good reason for such an extension has been shown.
The order for an extension of time for service on Valeo should therefore be set aside. The consequence is that the Valeo defendants were served out of time, and the claim against Valeo is therefore dismissed.
Jurisdictional gateways
The parties’ submissions
The position as regards the application of the jurisdictional gateways differs as between the various claimants.
As noted above, the OV claimants do not pursue any claims against DENSO in these proceedings, and have settled their claims against Valeo up to 10 March 2016. Accordingly, following the recent Sanden settlement agreement, the only claims pursued by the OV claimants in these proceedings are claims against Valeo brought on the basis of the overhang period in so far as it persisted beyond 10 March 2016. The OV claimants’ claims in that regard were served out on the basis of jurisdictional gateway 3, relying on the thirteenth defendant, Sanden International (Europe) GmbH, as the anchor defendant on the basis of service on its UK office. In the alternative the first claimant (only) relied on gateway 9(a) on the basis of supplies made to it in the jurisdiction by Sanden and Valeo.
For the reasons set out above, while Sanden is no longer a defendant in these proceedings, the jurisdictional gateways must be determined on the basis of the facts as they stood at the time of the order granting permission to serve out. In that regard, Valeo’s position is that there was (even prior to the Sanden settlement agreement) no serious issue to be tried as between the OV claimants and Sanden, and therefore no anchor defendant for the purposes of gateway 3. As for gateway 9(a), Valeo contends that the first claimant cannot demonstrate a good arguable case that it has suffered any significant damage in the jurisdiction to invoke gateway 9(a).
The claims of the PSA and FCA claimants were served on the service-out defendants on the basis of gateway 3, relying on the first, fifth and thirteenth defendants as the anchor defendants. The application of gateway 3 to those claims is not disputed by DENSO or Valeo.
In addition, to the extent necessary, the claimants seek permission to amend their application for permission to serve out, so as to add gateway 9(b) as an alternative jurisdictional gateway for the claims by the fourth claimant (only), relying on supplies made to its plant in Ryton, Warwickshire by Valeo and Sanden during (at least) 2005 and 2006. It is not necessary to consider this further, given the application of gateway 3 to those claims. The relevance of the supplies to the Ryton plant is, however, considered further below in relation to the forum non conveniens arguments of the defendants.
Finally, the claims of the Brazilian claimants were served on the service-out defendants on the basis of gateway 3, relying on the first, fifth and thirteenth defendants as the anchor defendants. The application of gateway 3 to those claims is not in principle disputed by Valeo (although Valeo does contest the addition of these claims in its amendment application, as noted above). DENSO does, however, dispute the application of gateway 3 on the basis that there is no real issue to be tried as between the Brazilian claimants and any of the anchor defendants.
It is therefore necessary to consider Valeo’s objection to the application of gateway 3 and (in so far as necessary) gateway 9(a) to the claims of the OV claimants, and DENSO’s objection to the application of gateway 3 to the claims of the Brazilian claimants.
The OV claimants
At the hearing, Ms Ford KC for Sanden submitted that the 2015 Sanden settlement agreement covered all of the claims by the OV claimants against Sanden, or at least the claims up to the date of the agreement. As for the overhang period beyond the date of the settlement agreement Ms Ford contended that any claims against Sanden were insufficiently pleaded, speculative and de minimis.
Mr Kennelly’s gateway 3 submission for Valeo was parasitic on Ms Ford’s submissions: he contended that if there was no serious issue to be tried as between the OV claimants and Sanden, then there was no remaining anchor defendant for the OV claimants’ claims against Valeo for the purposes of gateway 3. Those claims against Valeo are, for the reasons explained above, the only claims which are now still pursued by the OV claimants in these proceedings.
Those submissions raise two issues: (i) the scope of the 2015 Sanden settlement agreement; and (ii) the sufficiency of the pleaded case (as it stood against Sanden at the time of the order permitting service out) and evidence as regards the OV claimants’ claims against Sanden for the overhang period.
The scope of the 2015 Sanden settlement agreement
The 2015 Sanden settlement agreement was referred to in Sanden’s evidence in support of its application challenging jurisdiction. It was not, however, put in evidence by Sanden at the time. On 17 June 2024 Sanden provided the claimants with a redacted version of the agreement. A further version with fewer redactions was provided on 19 July 2024.
The agreement contains the following material clauses (not redacted in either version):
“Sanden’s Representation Regarding No Further Collusion. Other than with respect to the RFQs listed in Exhibit A hereto, Sanden represents that it is currently unaware of any collusion in which it participated against GM.1 Both parties acknowledge and agree that they have performed their own investigation into the matters covered by this Agreement, that they are not entering into this Agreement based upon any representations of the other except for the promise to perform the affirmative obligations set forth herein.
1 Nothing contained herein is or shall be interpreted as an admission by Sanden that it participated in collusion against GM, which allegations Sanden denies.
…
Release. GM and all subsidiaries and affiliates hereby release Sanden and all subsidiaries, affiliates, joint ventures, officers, directors, employees, agents, insurers, and attorneys from any and all claims, whether known or unknown, that exist as of the date of the settlement agreement and which relate to or arise out of GM’s allegations that Sanden engaged in anti-competitive activity that violates the Sherman Act and all similar antitrust provisions world wide. The parties acknowledge and agree, without limiting the foregoing, the scope of the release is expressly intended to and does encompass all world wide claims for damages without respect to the jurisdiction in which the alleged anti-competitive activity occurred or impacted GM in anyway whatsoever.”
A governing law clause in the agreement specifies that the agreement is governed by the law of the State of Michigan, with disputes under the agreement to be settled by arbitration to take place in New York (unless otherwise agreed by the parties) and subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the New York courts.
Exhibit A to the agreement then lists 12 RFQs (i.e. requests for quotations) dated 2004 to 2009, all relating to the supply of compressors to General Motors. No RFQs for any other products are listed.
Neither Ms Ford nor Mr Kennelly explained the basis on which they contended that this court could determine that the claims by the OV claimants against Sanden in these proceedings were precluded by the 2015 Sanden settlement agreement, in circumstances where there was no application for those claims to be struck out, and where the agreement itself provides for disputes under the agreement to be settled by arbitration in New York, subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the New York courts, and governed by Michigan law. In any event, I do not accept the submission that the 2015 Sanden settlement agreement must have covered all of the claims advanced by the OV claimants against Sanden in these proceedings, or at least the claims up to the date of the agreement.
Under the terms of the release clause, the 2015 Sanden settlement agreement settles all claims relating to or arising out of “GM’s allegations” that Sanden engaged in unlawful anticompetitive conduct. Those allegations are not defined anywhere in the agreement. At best, they can only be divined on the basis of inference from the representation clause, read together with the footnote to that clause and Exhibit A listing the RFQs. On the face of those provisions, the natural interpretation of the agreement is that it covers General Motors’ allegations of collusion in relation to the specified RFQs. There is no suggestion in the agreement that General Motors’ allegations extended to collusion concerning RFQs other than those listed in Exhibit A. Indeed, if the allegations had extended beyond those RFQs, it would have been very odd not to have listed those allegations in Exhibit A, given the terms of Sanden’s representation in the representation clause.
It is therefore not possible for the court, for the purposes of the present jurisdiction challenges, to conclude that the 2015 Sanden settlement agreement settled all the OV claimants’ claims against Sanden falling within the scope of the present proceedings. Even so far as claims relating to the period up to the date of the settlement agreement (24 June 2015) are concerned, and even taking the scope of the claim to be as set out in the original form without the amendments introduced by the re-re-amended claim form, the claim is not limited to the supply of compressors, but extends to other TSCs such as HVACs, radiators and fans. Nor was the claim limited, as regards the OV claimants’ purchases from Sanden, to the contracts set out in Exhibit A to the Sanden settlement agreement. As Mr West pointed out, the claimants had not yet been able to ascertain whether there were supplies of TSCs (whether condensers or other products) to the OV claimants under contracts not listed in Exhibit A.
I therefore reject the submission that the 2015 Sanden settlement agreement covered all of the OV claimants’ claims against Sanden, whether up to the date of the settlement agreement or beyond that date.
The pleaded case on the overhang period
Ms Ford described the OV claimants’ claims for the overhang period as “exorbitant and fanciful” and “pure speculation”, given that the Commission found that the latest date of Sanden’s infringement in respect of compressors for VW cars was 15 October 2009. Her submission was that, in the absence of any particulars supporting the allegation of an overhang period of that duration, the allegation of continued cartel effects lasting that length of time does not satisfy the standard for a pleading of a competition law infringement, as set out in Forrest Fresh Foods v Coca Cola [2021] CAT 29, §30.
Again, I do not accept that submission. Forrest Fresh Foods concerned an application for strike out or summary dismissal of the claim. As noted above, no such application has been made by Sanden in these proceedings. Nor, in any event, do I accept that the claimants’ pleaded case in relation to the overhang period is insufficiently particularised by reference to the test set Forrest Fresh Foods. §30 of that judgment notes that:
“The onus is on a claimant advancing a claim of infringement of competition law to identify (i) the relevant primary facts which are the foundation of that claim, (ii) the way in which those facts are said to infringe the relevant competition law provision(s) relied upon, and (iii) the way in which that alleged infringement is said to have resulted in the loss or damages claimed.”
In the present case, it is not suggested that the claim is deficient in its pleading of the relevant primary facts or the way in which the alleged conduct is said to have amounted to an infringement of the relevant competition law provisions. The issue is rather the claim for loss and damage extending to the overhang period. In that regard, the relevant paragraphs of the particulars of claim set out the following allegations:
The supplies in respect of which the Claimants sue in these proceedings (the ‘Supplies In Issue’) are supplies of TSCs purchased by the Claimants identified above, either from the Defendants or from other entities within the undertakings to which the Defendants belong, during the Cartel Period and for a period thereafter referred to as the ‘Overhang Period’. …
The Supplies In Issue were affected by the Cartel, in that the prices of such supplies were higher than they would have been had there been no such Cartel. In other words, the Claimants contend that the Supplies in Issue were subject to a cartel overcharge …
The precise duration of the Overhang Period will be addressed in expert evidence in due course, but for present purposes the Claimants allege that such period is likely to have lasted until at least 2016. The length of the Overhang Period reflects the fact that contracts for the supply of TSC products are often long-term in nature (reflecting the long-term nature of car production runs).”
The particulars of claim therefore plead that the reason for the overhang claim is the existence of long-term supply contracts (§88), the prices under which are said to have been higher than they would have been absent the cartel (§87). That is a sufficient pleading of the way in which the alleged infringement is said to have resulted in loss during the overhang period.
As for the suggestion that the OV claimants’ claims against Sanden are speculative and de minimis, the claimants rely on a preliminary quantum analysis prepared by their experts AlixPartners in relation to the claim by the PSA claimants. That analysis estimates that the PSA claimants continued to suffer significant losses until 2021, flowing from overcharges on contracts concluded during the cartel period. Ms Ford objected that this analysis does not relate to the OV claimants’ claims. But, as Mr West pointed out, there is no reason why the same analysis would not in principle also apply to the claims of the OV claimants. That position is also set out in the claimants’ draft amended particulars of claim. As to the materiality of the supplies during the overhang period, the OV claimants contend that Sanden made over €25m of supplies to the first claimant between 2014–2019.
I am clearly, at this stage of proceedings, not in any position to reach a view as to the merits of these claims (which have in any event now been settled). For the purposes of the jurisdictional gateway argument, however, there is no doubt that there is at least a plausible evidential basis for the pleaded claims by the OV claimants against Sanden, so as to satisfy the Brownlie limb (iii) test as set out at §§46–48 above. I do not, therefore, accept that the OV claimants’ claims are either insufficiently particularised or fanciful.
Conclusion on the OV claimants
It follows that I reject Valeo’s challenge to gateway 3 as a relevant jurisdictional gateway for the OV claimants’ claims in these proceedings, to the limited extent that such claims remain in issue. I do not, therefore, need to consider the application of gateway 9(a), relied on in the alternative for the claims of the first claimant.
The Brazilian claimants
At the hearing, Mr Moser submitted that the investigation by CADE relied upon in relation to the claims by the Brazilian claimants concerned the supply of TSCs by undertakings within the Valeo and DENSO groups (including two DENSO Brazilian companies), but the investigation did not concern supplies by either of the DENSO UK defendants or the Sanden group. The investigation did not, therefore, concern any of the anchor defendants in these proceedings for the purposes of gateway 3. Moreover, as set out above, the final CADE judgment concluded that the evidence against the DENSO Brazilian entities was insufficient to prove an infringement by those companies, to the standard required by Brazilian law. On that basis Mr Moser contended that there is no real issue to be tried as between the Brazilian claimants and any of the anchor defendants.
As Mr West noted, however, Brazilian law is presumed to be the same as domestic law, absent evidence to the contrary (which DENSO has not adduced): see FS Cairo (Nile Plaza) v Lady Brownlie [2021] UKSC 45, §125. In that regard, the claimants rely on the EU/EEA principle of liability attaching to undertakings which may include group companies that form a single economic unit for the purposes of the application of Article 101 TFEU/Article 53 of the EEA Agreement: see e.g. Bellamy & Child: European Union Law of Competition (8th ed, 2018), §2.026. For the purposes of these applications, that principle must be assumed to apply. It is therefore not relevant that the first and fifth defendants did not themselves supply the Brazilian claimants, and it is not suggested that the concept of a single economic unit cannot apply to those defendants, taken together with the DENSO Brazilian companies, on the facts.
As for the CADE judgment, the particulars of claim explain that while the CADE Tribunal concluded by a majority that the evidence did not meet the required standard of proof beyond reasonable doubt, the claimants rely on evidence referred to in the CADE investigation and judgment, which is said to provide a clear indication of anticompetitive conduct relating to the supply of automotive TSCs in Brazil by (among others) both Valeo and DENSO.
Again, while I evidently cannot reach a view as to the merits of the claims by the Brazilian claimants at this stage of the proceedings, there is at least a plausible evidential basis for these claims. I do not, therefore, accept DENSO’s arguments in relation to the application of gateway 3 to the claims of the Brazilian claimants.
Accordingly, I reject the applications to set aside the order permitting service out on the service-out defendants, on the basis of the jurisdictional gateways. On the basis of the circumstances at the time of that order (when Sanden remained a defendant), gateway 3 was an applicable gateway for all of the claims against those defendants.
Forum non conveniens
The parties’ submissions
As set out above, in a case such as the present where there are both service-in and service-out defendants, while there are differences in the burden of proof as between those two categories of defendants, the court is essentially seeking to identify the jurisdiction in which the claims against all of the defendants may most suitably be tried, and in that regard is looking for the forum with which the action has the most substantial connection.
The claimants’ submission at the hearing was that the anchor defendants have “strong and substantial” links to this jurisdiction, on the basis that the first defendant was an addressee of the Commission Decision, and the thirteenth defendant was the successor to SIE, which was one of the Sanden addressees. The claimants also relied on supplies by Sanden to the first claimant, and the supplies by Valeo and Sanden to the fourth claimant’s Ryton plant in 2005–2006. Mr West also referred to the experience of the courts of England and Wales in dealing with complex international competition litigation, and specifically the experience gained in the Stellantis Auto v Autoliv proceedings currently in the Competition Appeal Tribunal, in which the claimants have retained the same solicitors, leading counsel and economic experts as in these proceedings. Given the multi-jurisdictional nature of the claim, with both the claimants and the defendants based in numerous different jurisdictions, Mr West realistically accepted that there were several jurisdictions where the claim could appropriately be tried, including England and Wales. He contended, however, that that there is no other jurisdiction that is clearly the most appropriate for the trial of their claim.
By the time of the hearing, the defendants’ position was that France is clearly a more appropriate forum for the claims, having regard to the volume of supplies to France by comparison to the supplies elsewhere, the fact that the PSA claimants (whose purchases made up the vast majority of the relevant supplies) are headquartered in France, and the fact that Valeo is also headquartered in France with the majority of its relevant supplies made from the French Valeo entities. The defendants also relied on the location of relevant witnesses and documents, and the fact that on the claimants’ own case the laws governing the claims include French law (among others) but not the law of England and Wales. Valeo also relied (albeit somewhat faintly) on jurisdiction clauses in favour of France in the agreements for supplies to the PSA claimants.
In their October/November 2024 submissions following the Sanden settlement agreement, the defendants submitted that the concentration of the relevant supplies in France has now become even greater with the removal of Sanden from the claim. The claimants disputed some of the points made by the defendants, but their main objection was that the Sanden settlement was irrelevant for the purposes of the defendants’ forum non conveniens challenges. As set out above, I have rejected the latter submission: it is necessary to consider matters as they now stand, with Sanden no longer a defendant to these proceedings.
Finally, in their application to adduce new evidence, the claimants submit that 17 documents obtained from Sanden following the Sanden settlement agreement demonstrate that unlawful coordination between DENSO, Valeo and Sanden occurred within the jurisdiction between 2001 and 2007, which the claimants say rebuts the remaining defendants’ contentions on the absence of connection between the proceedings and this jurisdiction. The claimants contend that the new evidence should therefore be admitted in furtherance of the overriding objective and by analogy with the principles in Ladd v Marshall [1954] 1 WLR 1489.
The defendants’ position is that the court should not permit the claimants to rely on this evidence, whether on the basis of Ladd v Marshall or the overriding objective, not least because the further documents do not (according to the defendants) provide evidence of any cartel conduct within the jurisdiction, and are therefore immaterial to the assessment of the defendants’ forum non conveniens arguments. For the same reason, even if the documents were to be admitted, the defendants contend that they should not make any difference to the court’s analysis.
I will consider first the submissions advanced at the hearing and in the October/ November 2024 submissions, before considering the new evidence sought to be adduced by the claimants and the parties’ submissions as to the relevance of that evidence.
Available forum
There was no dispute that France would in principle be an available forum for the present claims. Although (on the claimants’ case) the limitation period for a claim there expired on 30 May 2022, that does not render that jurisdiction “unavailable” as an appropriate forum: see §49.xi) above.
Location of parties
The top holding company of the claimant group is Stellantis NV, the tenth claimant, which is headquartered in the Netherlands. During the period relevant to the claims, the holding company for the PSA group was Peugeot SA, a French company, and the top company of the FCA group was Fiat SpA, an Italian company. Only one of the claimants (the first claimant) is incorporated in England. Other than that claimant and the tenth claimant, the countries of domicile of the claimants are, as set out at paragraph 12 above, above, Germany, Spain, France, Italy, Serbia, Poland and Brazil.
As set out below, the clear majority of the supplies to the claimants currently identified as falling within the scope of the claim are supplies to claimants in the PSA group, headquartered in France. Notably, the only claimant which is incorporated in this jurisdiction (the first claimant) no longer pursues claims against either DENSO or Sanden, and it has also settled its claims against Valeo up to 10 March 2016. The consequence of those settlements is that there are no longer any supplies to the first claimant which have been definitively identified as being within the scope of the claim. As discussed below, the only identified UK supplies are de minimis supplies to the Ryton plant of the fourth claimant (a French company), and an even smaller quantity of replacement part sales to the first claimant which the defendants say do not fall within the claim. The locations of the claimants therefore do not point to England and Wales as the most appropriate forum for the claims. Rather, when considered in the context of the supplies subject to the claims, France is a more appropriate forum for the claims.
As regards the defendants remaining in the proceedings, DENSO is headquartered in Japan, and Valeo is headquartered in France. The countries of domicile of the individual DENSO and Valeo defendants are, as set out at paragraph 13 above, the UK, the Netherlands, France, Germany and Japan. The only remaining anchor defendants are the first and fifth defendants, from the DENSO group. There is, however, no reference in the claimants’ pleadings to any relevant supplies having been made by those defendants to any of the claimants. The locations of the defendants do not therefore point to England and Wales as the most appropriate forum for the claims. Rather, again as set out below, when considered in the context of the supplies subject to the claims, France is a more appropriate forum.
Economic effects of the alleged infringements
At the hearing, the claimants’ evidence was that the countries where the markets were affected, where the economic effects of the alleged infringement were felt, and where (accordingly) loss was suffered by the claimants, were Germany (OV claimants save for the first claimant), France (PSA claimants), Italy (FCA claimants), Brazil (Brazilian claimants) and the UK (first claimant only, plus some supplies to the Ryton plant of the fourth claimant).
Excluding the claims of the Brazilian claimants, which are unquantified, and with the claims against Sanden also now removed, the claimants’ current estimates of the value of the TSC purchases relevant to the claims indicate that the claims of the PSA claimants account for around 72% of the claims during the original cartel period. During that time the PSA group was (as set out above) headquartered in France; the losses are said to have been suffered in France; and the claims by those claimants are said to be governed by French law. The majority of the PSA group’s purchases relevant to the claims (around 62%) are said to have been from Valeo, headquartered in France, with around 38% from DENSO. The remaining 28% of the claims related to supplies made to the FCA group, which at the relevant time was headquartered in Italy; the losses are said to have been suffered in Italy; and as set out below the claims by those claimants are said to be governed by Italian law.
Following the Sanden settlement agreement, the only UK supplies identified by the claimant as being within the scope of the claim, or at least potentially so, are supplies said to have been made by Valeo to the Ryton plant of the fourth claimant in 2005–2006, and some sales by Valeo to the first claimant of replacement parts during the period 2014–2019.
Starting with the Ryton sales, the figures currently in evidence identify €7.1m total supplies from Valeo during the period from 2005–2006. That represents a tiny fraction of the claim: 0.2% of the total estimated value of commerce for the cartel period originally claimed (over €3.5bn) and an even smaller percentage of the total value of commerce including the amended cartel period and the overhang period. Even on the basis of the claimants’ extrapolation from the 2005–2006 figures to cover the period 1999–2004, the supplies in issue would amount to only around 1.3% of the estimated value of commerce for the original cartel period; again, that percentage will be even smaller if the amended cartel period and overhang period are taken into account. The Ryton sales are therefore de minimis in the context of the overall economic effects of the infringements.
As for the Valeo replacement parts sales during 2014–2019, there is a dispute as to whether those fall within the scope of the pleaded claim. In any event, however, the identified sales have a total value of €174,694. That is so minuscule as to be even more de minimis, even before taking into account that (i) the claim against Valeo has been settled for all purchases up to 10 March 2016; and (ii) even on the basis of the overhang period pleaded in the particulars of claim served with the re-re-amended claim form, there is no explicit claim for purchases beyond 2016. While the claimants say that the purchase data are incomplete, and seek to infer that additional supplies falling within the scope of the claim were made by Valeo, that is (as matters stand) pure speculation.
The economic effects of the infringements therefore point strongly to France as the appropriate forum, and away from England and Wales for which only minuscule relevant supplies have been identified.
Applicable law
The claimants do not contend that any part of their claim is subject to the law of England and Wales. On the claimants’ own case, on the basis of the economic effects of the alleged infringement, the claims are governed by German law (OV claimants), French law (PSA claimants), Italian law (FCA claimants) and Brazilian law (Brazilian claimants). As Mr Bolster notes in his evidence, although the claimants contend that the first claimant suffered loss in the UK, Germany was and is the centre of operations of the OV brands, such that the claimants’ primary case is that the first claimant’s claim is subject to German law. As discussed above, following the settlement with Sanden it is not clear that any supplies to the first claimant remain within the scope of the claim in any event.
The parties’ skeleton arguments and evidence explored in some detail the effect of the French jurisdiction clauses in the agreements of supply to the PSA claimants. By the time of the hearing that point had largely evaporated, with Mr Kennelly acknowledging that the clauses did not expressly cover claims based on breaches of competition law. I do not consider that anything material turns on these for the purposes of the present determination.
Witnesses and documents
Valeo’s evidence is that its witnesses in relation to sales to the PSA claimants are in France; and in relation to sales to the FCA claimants they are in Italy. DENSO’s evidence is that most of its witnesses are likely to be in either Italy or Brazil.
As for the documents likely to be relevant to these proceedings, according to the evidence before the court, Valeo’s documents are mostly in France, Spain and Italy, with none likely to be in the UK. DENSO’s documents are likely to be in Italy and in Brazil, with the language of those documents likely to be Italian, French or Portuguese; as with Valeo, none of DENSO’s documents are likely to be in the UK.
Having regard to the centre of gravity of the supplies within the scope of the claim (as discussed above), the evidence as to the location of witnesses and documents likewise points in favour of France as the appropriate forum. There is in this regard no connecting factor whatsoever with England and Wales.
Juridical advantages
The claimants rely on the Stellantis Auto v Autoliv proceedings in the Competition Appeal Tribunal as the “Cambridgeshire factor” pointing towards England as an appropriate forum. As discussed at §49.viii) above, however, it is not sufficient that the same legal team has been acting for the claimants in a parallel case. Even though the PSA Automobiles case concerns the same overarching sector, those proceedings are brought against different defendants and allege infringements in relation to different products.
Mr West relied on the fact that the claim in Stellantis Auto raises similar issues to those that would arise in the present case, such as the extent to which umbrella effects can be inferred from a finding of an overcharge based on a regression analysis, and issues of pass-on and financing losses. These are, however, issues that are commonplace in cartel damages claims. The fact that they arise in both the present claims and the PSA Automobiles is therefore entirely unremarkable, and falls far short of the situation in Spiliada where both those proceedings and the Cambridgeshire trial concerned claims for damages to vessels caused by the loading of sulphur onto the respective vessels by the same shippers at the same port, in circumstances where the solicitors for both claimants were the same and had built up a substantial bank of knowledge and experience with regard to the specific factual issues relevant for the case at hand (such as the carriage of sulphur on ships).
Mr West also relied on the processes available in the Competition Appeal Tribunal and the courts of England and Wales for dealing with disclosure issues in competition claims. In so far as there are differences between these procedures and the procedures of the French courts, however, such differences are in principle irrelevant to the question of whether to stay proceedings in this jurisdiction: see §49.x) above. While Mr Bolster has given evidence of his experience of litigation of one cartel trial in France, in which there was (apparently) very limited disclosure, I agree with Mr Kennelly’s submission that this does not come close to establishing that the claimants could not have obtained justice in the French courts, had they brought their proceedings there.
Finally on the issue of juridical advantages, it does not appear to be disputed that the limitation period under French law expired in 2022, such that any proceedings issued there would now likely be time-barred. There is, however, no suggestion by the claimants that they were unaware of the time-bar in other relevant jurisdictions. On the contrary, Mr Bolster’s witness statement in support of the claimants’ applications in May 2023 explicitly stated that the claimants had obtained German, French and Italian law advice on the limitation periods applicable in those jurisdictions. Nor is there any convincing explanation of why the claimants failed to issue protective proceedings in France. The only purported explanation proffered by Mr Bolster in his evidence is an assertion that it would have been unreasonable for the claimants to be put to the “burden” of starting protective proceedings in other jurisdictions. No evidence is, however, given as to the time and expense of doing so, and the assertion is in any event wholly unpersuasive in the context of the scale of the litigation and the considerable costs no doubt incurred so far in these proceedings.
Rather, it is clear from Mr Bolster’s evidence that the real reason for issuing the claim in England was the claimants’ view that their claim could only be proven by obtaining “English-style disclosure, which is not generally available in Civil law countries”. The decision to issue proceedings only in this jurisdiction was therefore a deliberate litigation strategy, with awareness of the consequences. That is not, however, a sufficient reason for trying the proceedings in this jurisdiction. Nor is there, in the circumstances, any reason why a stay or set-aside of service should be made conditional on terms that the defendants should waive any limitation defence in France (and indeed I have not seen any evidence of their ability to do so).
The claimants’ application to adduce new evidence
The claimants seek to adduce new evidence in the form of 17 documents obtained following the Sanden settlement agreement, on the basis of the application of the overriding objective, and an analogy with the Ladd v Marshall principles. Their application is supported by two further witness statements from Mr Bolster. Mr Bolster explains how the documents came into the claimants’ possession, describes their content, and sets out what the claimants consider to be their relevance to the issue of forum non conveniens.
The Ladd v Marshall principles provide guidance on the admission of new evidence on appeal. It is, however, well-established that those principles are also relevant factors to consider in other situations where an application is made to adduce fresh evidence after the hearing, such as after final submissions but before a draft judgment has been circulated, or between circulating the draft judgment and handing down the final judgment, or between handing down the final judgment and sealing the order giving effect to the judgment: see e.g. K v K (Abduction) (No. 2) [2009] EWHC 3378 (Fam), Tetronics (International) v HSBC Bank [2018] EWHC 201 (TCC), and Augusti v Matharu [2023] EWHC 1900 (Fam).
The three criteria in Ladd v Marshall for the admission of fresh evidence are that: (i) it must be shown that the evidence could not have been obtained with reasonable diligence for use at the trial; (ii) if given, the evidence would probably have an important influence on the result of the case, though it need not be decisive; and (iii) the evidence is apparently credible. The courts have, however, repeatedly emphasised that the Ladd v Marshall principles should not be treated as a straitjacket, and regard must always be ultimately to the application of the overriding objective in the particular case: see e.g. Al Sadeq v Dechert [2024] EWCA Civ 28, §141.
In the present case, I am satisfied that the evidence could not reasonably have been obtained by the time of the July 2024 hearing. As Mr Bolster explains, the claimants only received the documents in November 2024, following settlement with Sanden the previous month. Prior to that settlement the defendants had refused to provide voluntary disclosure (or had not responded to requests to do so). Valeo in its submissions suggests that the claimants might have settled after the hearing in the hope of obtaining further evidence so as to improve their position against the remaining defendants. There is no evidence before me which supports that suggestion. Mr Bolster’s evidence is, to the contrary, that the claimants had been in active settlement discussions with Sanden since before the jurisdiction hearing in July 2024.
I am also satisfied that the documents on which the claimants now seek to rely are apparently credible, so far as they go. According to the claimants, they are [REDACTED].
I do not, however, consider that the new documents have any material impact on the question of forum non conveniens. The documents consist of [REDACTED]. It is apparent from the documents that [REDACTED]. The claimants’ evidence indicates that [REDACTED].
The evidence indicates, therefore, that [REDACTED]. There is, however, no evidence of any conduct by DENSO or Valeo which took place in this jurisdiction. In some cases it is clear that [REDACTED].
More importantly, while the claimants argue that the documents show that [REDACTED], none of the new documents provide evidence of any unlawful conduct being implemented in England and Wales in relation to the supplies of TSCs by DENSO and Valeo which remain at issue in these proceedings. Moreover, even if the documents were in some way relevant to the remaining claims against DENSO and Valeo, [REDACTED].
Set against all the other factors considered above, the new documents provide evidence of (at most) only a very marginal connection to this jurisdiction. They do not, therefore, have any material impact on the assessment set out above, that the forum with which the proceedings have the most substantial connection is France rather than England and Wales. On that basis, the Ladd v Marshall test is not satisfied, nor would it be in accordance with the overriding objective for the new evidence to be admitted at this stage. Furthermore, for the same reasons, even if the documents were to be admitted in evidence, they would not change the conclusion as to the proper forum for the dispute.
Conclusion on forum non conveniens
My conclusion is that the forum with which the dispute has the closest connection is France; and that France is (very clearly) the natural forum for the dispute. The defendants’ challenges to jurisdiction on the grounds of forum non conveniens therefore succeed.
Overall conclusions
My conclusions on the issues raised by the defendants’ applications are therefore:
The order for an extension of time for service on Valeo will be set aside. The claim against Valeo is therefore dismissed.
I reject the applications to set aside the order permitting service out on the basis of the jurisdictional gateways.
The jurisdiction which is the natural forum for the dispute, and with which the dispute has the closest connection, is France. The defendants’ challenges on the basis of forum non conveniens therefore succeed. Accordingly, the claims against the first and fifth defendants will be stayed. The orders permitting service out on the remaining defendants will be set aside, and the claim against those defendants dismissed.

Mrs Justice McGowan DBE:
Mr Kevan Thakrar, the Claimant, brings a claim for judicial review with the permission of Ritchie J on six grounds. He also renews his application for permission to bring a claim on a seventh ground. He brings the claim against the Secretary of State for Justice, (“SSJ”), as the Minister responsible for His Majesty’s Prison and Probation Service, (“HMPPS”).
The Claimant is represented by Mr Nick Armstrong KC and Mr Aidan Wills instructed by Mr Dean Kingham of Reece Thomas Watson Solicitors.
The Defendant is represented by Mr Sam Grodzinski KC and Mr Myles Grandison instructed by Miss Carolyn Toh of the Government Legal Department.
I am very grateful to all involved in the case for their detailed and helpful oral and written submissions, particularly to Mr Armstrong for his very helpful verbatim speaking note.
Preamble
The hearing of this claim for review was held on 25 and 26 April 2023. On 30 May 2023 the Claimant was moved by the Defendant to HMP Manchester. He had been informed on 24 January 2023 that the move was likely. I requested the parties to provide updates to the court. They were provided in September and October 2023.
The Claimant’s update says that although Mr Thakrar had not wished to be moved to Manchester, as he feared conflict with racist persons there, the move appears to have gone well. He has been allowed to associate with a couple of other prisoners within the Close Supervision Centre, (“CSC”).
The Claimant asserts that the prison authorities still require that any meetings with a psychologist should not take place on a one-to-one basis but that another person be present for security reasons.
In response the Defendant asserts that as a result of the Multi-Disciplinary Team, (“MDT”), being able to monitor the Claimant and carry out a number of checks, the requirement that a third person be present at any psychology sessions was removed on 28 September 2023 at a Dynamic Risk Assessment Meeting, (“DRAM”), and that the Claimant was informed of its removal. Notwithstanding the removal of that requirement the Claimant is still unwilling to engage in any psychology sessions or treatment. The Claimant’s wishes are “being respected” whilst he is still encouraged to begin engagement with the team. He continues to have limited engagement with other staff, who “may be able” to consider his health and well-being.
They also point out that his fears about coming into contact with racist prisoners have not materialised and he has not made any complaints under the procedure for reporting incidents of discrimination.
Whilst he remains in a CSC under Prison Rule 46, (“PR46”),  he in no longer held in a Designated Cell, (“DC”).
Judgment in the case of R (Awale) v SSJ EWHC [2024] 2322 (Admin) was handed down on 9 September 2024. Both junior counsel in this case had appeared in that hearing in July 2023. The case has similarities with the issues in this review. It raised questions about the authorisation of a removal from association with other prisoners which may have a bearing on the two aspects of a decision made to apply PR46. Further, that court also dealt with the provision of reasons for segregation under PR46,
I was asked to allow counsel to re-open their submissions limited to the extent of considering this new authority. I granted that and received submissions in September and October 2024. I have re-visitedthe relevant parts of this judgment in the light of that decision. I have been told, when the judgment went out to counsel in draft, that the Claimant was moved again in May 2024, to HMP Whitemoor and was returned to segregation.
Introduction
The Claimant challenges the ongoing lawfulness of the decision taken by the Defendant, through the HMPPS, to segregate him from other prisoners in the Long Term High Security Estate, (“LTHSE”), by moving him to a DC. The Defendant applied PR46, which empowers him to stop a prisoner associating with other prisoners within a CSC,  for the maintenance of good order or discipline or to ensure the safety of officers, prisoners or other any other person”. He does not challenge the lawfulness of that original decision to place him in the CSC, in these proceedings. The Claimant argues that this course is in breach of his rights under Articles 3 and 8 under the European Convention on Human Rights, (“the Convention”). He further argues that the reasons given for his segregation are inadequate.
The Claimant uses the term “solitary confinement” to describe his separation from other prisoners. The Defendant does not accept the use of that term and uses “segregation” to describe the separation from other prisoners whilst having continued contact with prison staff, health care staff, faith leaders, legal teams and family and others.
There is no general definition of the term “solitary confinement” in domestic law. The term solitary confinement does appear in some of the authorities but the term “removal from association” is used in the rules and the decision making process. The Defendant relies on R (AB) v SSJ [2021] UKSC 28, [2022] AC 487 to submit that this, and all cases, should proceed on an “evaluation of the circumstances of the individual case”. Whatever term is used, it is a serious measure and should only be used, as a last resort when necessary and proportionate and its use must be fully justified. I do not think it necessary or helpful to attempt to provide a definition of the term “solitary confinement”. Whatever it means it encompasses the segregation of one prisoner from other prisoners.  I will use the term “segregation” as that is the word used in the decision making process at the core of this review.
The Claimant does not challenge the lawfulness of the original decision to apply PR 46, he intends to pursue that claim in separate proceedings. He argues that the Defendant has acted unlawfully in continuing to not allow him to associate with other prisoners, also held under PR46, in a CSC. I must therefore proceed on the basis that that original decision is not unlawful.
He seeks a mandatory order transferring him out of segregation and into circumstances where he is allowed to associate with other prisoners. (He was moved in May 2023 and was having contact with a small number of other prisoners but has sine been moved again). He seeks a declaration that his placement in a DCis in breach of his rights under Articles 3 and 8 of the Convention and that the Defendant has breached common law requirements of procedural fairness and failed to follow her own policy in respect of (re)authorising the Claimant’s segregation..The breaches are said to be as a result of insufficient reasoning, which is also poorly and inadequately expressed. It is submitted that the decisions taken cannot be justified by the Claimant’s unwillingness or inability to engage. Further, he seeks to establish that the policy as set out in the Operating Manual 2017 is unlawful because it justifies segregation, in general terms on the basis of a “passive refusal”.
The management of the prison estate and the safe detention of prisoners is a complex exercise. Not only must they be kept safe and secure as individuals but the combination of prisoners is required to be monitored constantly to protect those individuals and staff. Responsibility for carrying out that function is delegated to HMPPS staff of sufficient rank who have experience and expertise in such matters.
The Defendant must have a mechanism whereby prisoners who are dangerous and or disruptive can be managed, sometimes by removal from the general prison population. The CSC’s were established to achieve that aim. At the time of the hearing there were 68 places for prisoners held outside the general population under PR46, 56 of those places are in CSC’s around the prison estate and 12 are in DC’s within the segregation units of various prisons.
Spaces in DC’s are used to accommodate prisoners when it is necessary to remove them from the CSC’s. In April 2017 the Close Supervision Centres, Long Term and High Security Estate Operating Manual was issued. It describes the aims of the creation of the system of CSC’s, (emphasis added),
Aims of the CSC system
The overall aim of the CSC system is to remove the most significantly disruptive, challenging, and dangerous prisoners from ordinary location, and manage them within small and highly supervised units; to enable an assessment of individual risks to be carried out, followed by individual and/or group work to try to reduce the risk of harm to others, thus enabling a return to normal or a more appropriate location as risk reduces. Referrals will be submitted subject to criteria which includes following a single serious incident, on-going or escalating serious violence, or when prisoners have not responded to attempts to manage them using existing processes, such as under the Managing Challenging Behaviour Strategy (MCBS) (Long Term and High Security Estate only).
The scheme is intended to manage, at a local level, those “selected” for movement into a CSC and to work towards “deselection” or removal from a CSC.
Local Management
Each of the CSC units will have a designated Operational Manager, who will work closely with the Unit’s lead Forensic Psychologist, and alongside a multi-disciplinary staff team. The Manager will be responsible for the management of the CSC unit, and/or designated cells, and all related work and procedures required, and will act as CSC contact for the establishment’s senior management team. The Operational Manager from each establishment must attend the monthly CSC Management Committee (CSCMC) meeting and be given sufficient authority to act on behalf of their Governor to enable them to make and agree decisions at the meeting.
The role of the Lead Psychologist is integral to the system. They attend Central Management Group (“CMG”), monthly meetings.
CMG alongside local MDTs liaise directly with the prison based Personality Disorder treatment units to aid decision making in respect of prisoners referred to the CSC or CMG, or where CSC or centrally managed MCBS (managing challenging behaviour strategy), cases are transferred for treatment to ensure a  handover of both behavioural and clinical information, and in particular current medication regimes, to ensure a safe and informed transfer.
The CSC Management Committee, (“CSCMC”), meets monthly. Its decisions, reasoning and action points are minuted, they are to be read in conjunction with reports submitted. The purpose of the meetings includes reaching decisions on whether a referred prisoner meets the criteria for assessment for the CSC; whether, following assessment, a prisoner requires placement within a CSC; reviews and determines the location of prisoners within the CSC and movement within locations as necessary; considers options for the future management of prisoners with in the CSC as informed by the local MDT and make decisions regarding commissioning assessments for the de-selection of prisoners, and if such a de-selection is appropriate.
The History
The Claimant was convicted of murdering three people and attempting to murder two others. He is serving a sentence of life imprisonment.
The aims and purposes of imprisonment have often been re-stated but are now set out in statute in section 57(2) of the Sentencing Act 2020,
The court must have regard to the following purposes of sentencing—
the punishment of offenders,
the reduction of crime (including its reduction by deterrence),
the reform and rehabilitation of offenders,
the protection of the public, and
the making of reparation by offenders to persons affected by their offences.
The punishment is to be achieved by the imposition of the sentence. It should be the fact of deprivation of liberty that punishes. The conditions of detention should not be intended to be punitive for the original offending, of themselves. An offender may be deprived of their liberty but not their dignity to any extent that is more than proportionate and necessary. No restrictions or conditions can be lawfully applied unless they are proportionate and necessary. They must be justified by sufficient and proper reasons. Hirst v UK (2006) 42 EHRR 41 at [69 et seq], Van der Ven v Netherlands (2004) 38 EHRR 46
Article 3 of the Convention provides that, “No one shall be subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment”. It is an absolute right.
If rehabilitation is possible, to whatever extent, it should be attempted. For the type of offending in this case, the protection of the public, the offender and others with whom he comes into contact is always an essential consideration for the authorities.
The conditions of detention, any prospect of rehabilitation and the means of achieving it, have all to be based on a full and continuing assessment of risk. Risk in its broadest sense includes risk to the public, to all other prisoners, to all staff and to the prisoner himself. The risk presented by a prisoner requires continuing and informed assessment. That assessment will largely dictate levels of control and restraint. A prisoner who presents a danger to others throughout their sentence will remain in detention under conditions of restraint. Whilst risk requires continuing assessment, so too does the level of restraint to be applied. Such restraint must always be proportionate, necessary and justified.
It is the duty of a prison governor to maintain order and security, keeping prisoners secure and safe. They are required to protect the public by preventing escape; to protect prisoners and all staff from violence and abuse.
The Defendant, through her departments and agencies are experts in the management of prisoners, including the assessment of risk. As was said in R (Gilbert) v SSJ [2015] EWCA Civ 802, the statutory regime recognises and supports this.
Prison Regime
Prison Act s.12 requires the prison authorities to hold prisoners on remand awaiting trial and serving sentences at a prison directed by the Defendant.
Prison Rule 47authorises the Defendant to make rules for the management of prisoners ……..and“for the classification, treatment, employment, discipline and control of persons required to be detained therein”
Prison Rule 45
Removal from association
—(1) Where it appears desirable, for the maintenance of good order or discipline or in his own interests, that a prisoner should not associate with other prisoners, either generally or for particular purposes, the governor may arrange for the prisoner’s removal from association [for up to 72 hours].
Removal for more than 72 hours may be authorised by the governor in writing who may authorise a further period of removal of up to 14 days.
(2A) Such authority may be renewed for subsequent periods of up to 14 days.
(2B) But the governor must obtain leave from the Secretary of State in writing to authorise removal under paragraph (2A) where the period in total amounts to more than 42 days starting with the date the prisoner was removed under paragraph (1).
( 2C) The Secretary of State may only grant leave for a maximum period of 42 days, but such leave may be renewed for subsequent periods of up to 42 days by the Secretary of State.
The governor may arrange at his discretion for a prisoner removed under this rule to resume association with other prisoners at any time
(3A) In giving authority under paragraphs (2) and (2A) and in exercising the discretion under paragraph (3), the governor must fully consider any recommendation that the prisoner resumes association on medical grounds made by a registered medical practitioner or registered nurse working within the prison.
This rule shall not apply to a prisoner the subject of a direction given under rule 46(1).
Prison Rule 46
Close supervision centres
46.—(1) Where it appears desirable, for the maintenance of good order or discipline or to ensure the safety of officers, prisoners or any other person, that a prisoner should not associate with other prisoners, either generally or for particular purposes, the Secretary of State may direct the prisoner’s removal from association accordingly and his placement in a close supervision centre of a prison.
A direction given under paragraph (1) shall be for a period not exceeding one month [or, during a coronavirus period, three months], but may be renewed from time to time for a like period [and shall continue to apply notwithstanding any transfer of a prisoner from one prison to another].
The Secretary of State may direct that such a prisoner as aforesaid shall resume association with other prisoners, either within a close supervision centre or elsewhere.
In exercising any discretion under this rule, the Secretary of State shall take account of any relevant medical considerations which are known to him.
A close supervision centre is any cell or other part of a prison designated by the Secretary of State for holding prisoners who are subject to a direction given under paragraph (1).
The prison authorities had to adapt to the limitations and restrictions caused by the response required to the Covid pandemic. Those restrictions have had some considerable effect on the conditions of detention for a significant part of the recent history of this case.
The Defendant has a duty to maintain good order in prisons, it is therefore necessary to separate prisoners or move them, on occasion, out of the general prison population. If necessary there is the power to segregate one prisoner from other prisoners. That is a serious step with significant consequences and should only be done when it is necessary and proportionate. There is no doubt that segregation can have a severe effect on an already vulnerable person’s state of mind, that is recognised in the Prison Service Order 1700, (2001 amended 2022).
Close Supervision Centre Referral Manual (PSI 42-2012)
All prisoners, but especially those held in the LTHSE, may be moved to a CSC,
Desired Outcome
The aim of the referral process is to identify those prisoners who pose a significant risk of  harm to others and fully document the risks to enable a decision to be made whether selection into the CSC system for assessment is necessary to prevent others from serious  harm.  It is vital the referral documents are completed in full and that reports are accurate, evidenced, use appropriate language, and reflect the current and/or potential risk that an  individual presents.
The paragraph setting out the “desired outcome” makes it clear that movement into a CSC is for assessment in the prevention of serious harm to others. The assessment of risk is at the core of the process. A referral should only take place once “all options” have been exhausted or are inappropriate, as set out in the referral criteria. Prison staff are also required to consider whether a prisoner suffers from a mental illness or disorder.
Evidence and disputes of fact
The Defendant observes that there has been no application by the Claimant to cross-examine his witnesses, in particular Alex Worsman, who sets out the history of the risk assessment by the Defendant. Following Underhill LJ in Singh v SSHD [2018] Civ EWCA 2861, in the absence of testing by cross-examination I am bound to follow uncontradicted evidence unless “it cannot be correct”.
In a claim for judicial review it is highly unusual to have witnesses called to be cross-examined. In the majority of cases there is no, or so little factual dispute that it has any bearing on the proceedings. This is a case in which there are very many areas of factual dispute. The Claimant challenges the veracity of  most, if not all, of the reasoning and records kept during the period covered by this claim. Mr Armstrong submits that I should follow the approach taken by Linden J in R (NB & others) v SSHD [2021] 4 WLR 92 at [23]-[37]
“37………….essentially it requires a common-sense approach to the evaluation of the evidence as a whole, applying the burden of proof and taking into account the fact that there has been no ""live"" evidence or cross examination. In my view, as part of this exercise it is permissible to take into account the quality of the evidence on a given point, and whether that evidence is within the knowledge of the deponent and, if not, the source of their information. In the case of exhibits, it is permissible to consider such evidence as the deponent provides to explain its contents and as to the source and reliability of the information which it contains.”
I am bound to determine the factual disputes only on the written material. I accept that, in the absence of cross-examination I can reach conclusions on the areas of dispute, which have to be resolved, applying a common sense approach and always bearing in mind where the burden of proof lies.
I bear in mind that most of the records have generally been compiled contemporaneously or within a relatively short period of time. They are documents kept under the general scheme for recording reasoning and decision making. They should be viewed as being accurately kept in the course of the proper management of the prison service, unless that is shown not to be the case. They are often in the form of notes of meetings which are subsequently circulated for approval and or correction.
There are on some occasions other pieces of evidence that support a particular account upon which it is sensible and “common sense” to rely. A particular example is the conflict between accounts given about the movement of the Claimant to HMP Belmarsh in August 2021, dealt with below.
Unsurprisingly, given the time frame, the selection of documents in the bundles amounts to almost 3,000 pages of evidence. I was taken through all the relevant material carefully by counsel during the hearing and I have read that and the balance of the material again with care. I have not attempted to summarise or refer to all the documentation which has been considered.
History of offending
On 2 October 2008 the Claimant was sentenced to life imprisonment. The minimum term he must serve before being eligible to apply for parole was set at 35 years. He had been convicted by a jury in the Crown Court sitting at St Albans, of three counts of murder, two counts of attempted murder and one count of the possession of a firearm with intent to endanger life. His brother was convicted of the same offences. Three men had been shot dead. Two women, present in the house, were stabbed, with an intention to kill, and seriously injured.
The incident took place in a house in Bishop’s Stortford, the Claimant and his brother had gone to the house in a dispute arising out of drug dealing and together carried out the attack. Both the brothers had gone to the scene with a Mach 10 firearm and a large quantity of ammunition. They carried out the attack, which was described by the Court of Appeal Criminal Division as a “massacre” and “ruthless and brutal”. The Claimant’s brother actually carried and used the gun.
The Claimant had denied the offences and had relied on the defence of alibi. He claimed to have been elsewhere at the house of a friend. He had been arrested attempting to leave the country. His appeal against conviction was unsuccessful, there does not seem to have been an application for leave to appeal against the sentence imposed. He has told Dr Craisatti recently that he still disputes his guilt.
Following conviction the claimant was assessed as Category A, he has remained at that categorisation throughout his detention. Category A prisoners are those whose “escape would be highly dangerous to the public……”.
History of conduct whilst in custody
On 13 March 2010 the Claimant caused serious injury to three members of the prison staff with a weapon made from a broken glass bottle. He says that the bottle was deliberately “planted” in his cell to implicate him and that he broke it, in order to have it available as a weapon of defence, if, as he expected, he was attacked by the prison officers. The incident occurred whilst he was being held as a Category A prisoner at HMP Frankland.
He was tried and acquitted on charges of attempted murder and assault. His case at trial was that he acted, in lawful self-defence, to pre-empt an attack on him by the prison officers which he believed was about to happen. The relevance of his acquittal is important in the continuing history of his status in detention.
Status of convictions and acquittals
It is a central plank of the Claimant’s submissions that the verdicts of not guilty prove that he did not act in a way that was unlawfully violent and that the prison authorities should not have any regard to that incident in its planning and management of his detention.
Section 74 of Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, provides that a conviction is proof of guilt. An acquittal is not conclusive evidence of innocence R v Terry [2004] EWCA Crim 3252 per Auld LJ at [43]
“An acquittal is not conclusive evidence of innocence unless by that word it is meant not guilty in law of the alleged offence to which it relates. Nor does it mean that all relevant issues have been resolved in favour of a defendant. In Hay, for example, positive innocence of the arson was not logically an inevitable conclusion to draw from the acquittal. It could have simply been that the jury had been unsure of his guilt in view of the alibi evidence. And, if evidence is relevant and admissible, we can see no reason for distinguishing between different types of evidence for this purpose.”
Mr Thakrar was found not guilty of all the offences on the indictment he faced. The acquittal on those charges is not conclusive proof of his innocence. They prove that the jury was not sure that the prosecution had discharged the evidential burden of disproving his claim of reasonable self-defence. In any event, a jury verdict is not reasoned, there is no basis for the submission that an acquittal proves that the jury was sure that he suffered from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, (“ PTSD”) or that he does indeed suffer from PTSD.
The question of the acquittals was raised in a referral by the Claimant to the Prisons and Probation Ombudsman, the Claimant contested that the incident should not be relied upon for any purpose by HMPPS in determining the level of risk that he presented. The Prisons and Probation Ombudsman’s view is set out as follows,
“Mr Thakrar was acquitted at Court of assaulting the three members of staff.
However, that does not mean that he did not inflict (serious) injuries on them,
whether or not he was guilty in law of assault. If, as was suggested, his actions
amounted to pre-emptive self-defence, there is no reason to suppose that the
same situation might not arise again. I am aware from dealing with other
complaints, that Mr Thakrar says he suffers from Post-Traumatic Stress
Disorder. That being the case, it must be assumed that his reactions are always
likely to be unpredictable. Notwithstanding the finding of the Court, I cannot
find the inclusion of the alert of risk to staff unreasonable. Furthermore, I do
not consider that the passage of time without a similar incident since that time
affords any reassurance, given that Mr Thakrar has been very closely managed
in the interim.”
Mr Armstrong has sought to argue that the jury’s verdicts of not guilty are the final word on the incident but I cannot accept that submission. The Claimant was acquitted and is therefore entitled to make the point that the case against him was not proved. However that does not mean that HMPPS are not entitled, and bound to, consider the incident in terms of risk assessment. That is particularly so in the light of the observations by the Ombudsman about the risk of unmanageable and unpredictable reactive behaviour by the Claimant.
Movement after acquittal
On 26 March 2010 he was transferred to the CSC at HMP Woodhill for assessment following the incident at HMP Frankland. The following month, April, he was selected for movement into a CSC. The CSCMC making that selection did not make any findings of fact about the incident at HMP Frankland. Such decisions are made for management and security purposes, (as are decisions about PR45), they are not hearings to determine the facts of an incident or any allegation arising from it, see R (Bourgass) v SSJ [2015] UKSC 54 at [92],
It is important to be clear at the outset as to the nature of the decision-making in question. Decisions under rule 45(2) do not involve the determination of a charge against the prisoner or the imposition of a punishment, either in form or in substance. As counsel for the Secretary of State emphasised, segregation decisions are not based on a determination of fact as to whether a particular event has occurred, but involve a judgment as to the risk posed to the good order and discipline of the prison, and whether the particular situation could be equally or better addressed by other measures, such as transfer to another wing, closer supervision on normal location or transfer to another establishment. Allegations may be made against a prisoner, but the subject matter of the Secretary of State’s decision is not whether the prisoner behaved as alleged: these are not disciplinary proceedings.”
In July 2011 he was moved to HMP Durham, and in the same month he was moved to the Healthcare Unit at HMP Full Sutton and then back to HMP Woodhill. He stayed at HMP Woodhill until he was moved to HMP Manchester in June 2013, from there he was moved to HMP Whitemoor in December 2013 and back to HMP Woodhill in August 2014. In January 2015 he went back to HMP Full Sutton until March 2015 when he was moved to HMP Wakefield, he stayed there for two years and was moved back to HMP Woodhill in March 2017. From there he went to HMP Long Lartin in March 2018 and on to HMP Whitemoor in July 2018.
The Claimant was moved to the CSC at HMP Full Sutton in September 2019. At that stage he was held on “mixed unlock”. This meant that he was able to mix with some other prisoners being held in the CSC.
On 7 April 2021 he was moved to a DC, at HMP Full Sutton, described by the claimant as solitary confinement. It means he is segregated from other prisoners. He was informed of the move and the reasons given in the Initial Reasons Letter dated 9 April 2021. He complains that the reasons given are insufficient and inaccurate, although I repeat that this decision is not the subject of challenge in this case,
“Dear Mr Thakrar
This letter is to notify you that following discussion held with the Central Management Group (CMG), you are to be moved to a designated cell (DC) within HMP Full Sutton. Further discussions by the CMG will take place in due course regarding your future location within the CSC system.
This decision has been taken due to your continued non engagement with the multi-disciplinary team at Full Sutton. Despite consistent efforts by our team to promote an open channel of verbal communication, you continue to ignore the team other than to make general applications or meet your basic needs. Since your transfer to the unit at Full Sutton your levels of engagement with a range of professionals has declined, including the Chaplaincy and Gymnasium staff.
It is also of concern that you continue to choose not to engage with the current clinical team in order to address your risks and to progress through the CSC system. You have refused to attend regular review meetings in order to discuss your levels of engagement, CMP targets and any issues you may have had for a number of months, despite COVID safe measures being in place.
What is concerning, is a documented incident where you made an indirect threat towards your Prison Offender Manager (POM) on the telephone systems where you stated; ''you can only be a certain level of stupid before you need to have someone put your fist in their face, he will not learn any other way."" This comment related to the recent OASys report your POM wrote for which you received a written warning.
It is evident that you do not currently fit the criteria for the CSC unit at Full Sutton, despite the efforts, encouragement and support provided by the team. Your behaviour has not only been challenging for staff but has affected the progression of the other men on the unit.
In terms of the DC you will have access to psychology services and will be able to apply for Purple Visits, I understand this is something you have wanted to access for some time now but the CSC building does not have the infrastructure to support this, I'm pleased to say the segregation unit at Full Sutton does have the infrastructure in place.
In terms of future progression we are more than happy to welcome you back to the unit at Full Sutton in the future when you improve your levels of engagement with the local MDT and the CSC process as a whole, where we will be waiting to engage with you to aid in your progression through the CSC system.
Yours sincerely
Governor—Head of Small Units”
As can be seen from the terms of the letter, the Defendant’s explanation arises, substantially, from the Claimant’s continuing refusal to engage with the MDT at HMP Full Sutton and the clinical team, in addition to the threat to assault a member of staff.
The Claimant says that the move on 7 April was a “so called emergency transfer” which meant that the CSCMC had not given prior approval. The letter sets out that the decision was taken by the CMG. The Claimant complains that he could have been placed under “restricted unlock” within the CSC Unit and that that step was never considered. He states that a white, racist prisoner, who posed a greater risk, was moved out of the CSC to make way for him, in what he describes as a straight swap”.
He relies upon this “swap” and other similar instances as further evidence of a deliberate and illegitimate campaign to cause him psychological harm.
Additionally, the decision in the letter of 9 April was based upon an indirect threat made to assault his Prison Offender Manager, (“POM”). The threat was noted, there was no adjudication. The Claimant’s solicitor suggests that the fact of there being no adjudication means that the threat was never regarded as a “serious concern”.
The Claimant speaks of a “false allegation”, but the evidence shows that the threat was recorded. It was stated to a third party in the course of a recorded telephone conversation. It was submitted, on his behalf, that it was an indirect threat and that it would not have caused serious harm. Viewed objectively, it is a threat to assault a prison officer by striking him in the face.
The threat was an important, but additional, contribution to the decision taken. A thread of concerns about the Claimant posing a risk of violence to others runs through the entire history. Whether it was necessary or desirable to have held an adjudication hearing when the comment was recorded does not need to be resolved in this case but it does not follow that the failure to pursue the matter to adjudication does not mean that it was not treated as a serious concern.
In any event on 30 April 2021 the Defendant wrote to the Claimant’s solicitors, making clear that it was not an emergency response, rather describing it as an “operational move”, given the “increased risk” presented by the threat to the POM “as well as his continued non-engagement with the staff, Psychology team and the CSC process”.
The recommendation made to the CSCMC dated 14 April 2021 concludes that the Claimant was “appropriately placed within the CSC system and Segregation DC here at Full Sutton”.
The Claimant’s concerns and reactions are noted in the document. It is said that he complained that he had not yet received a copy of the report to be submitted to the CSCMC on 20 April. He further asks that his representations, set out in his letter to the Independent Monitoring Board, (“IMB”), be passed on to the CSCMC. He did not believe that the reasons given were a sufficient justification for the move. He stated that a segregation unit was not the best location for him, given that he had been diagnosed with PTSD.He requested a move to HMP Whitemoor and said that he would be content to wait for a few weeks in Belmarsh until a space became available at Whitemoor. The Claimant disputes that he responded in that way.
A further CSCMC meeting was held on 18 May 2021. The entry in the minutes relating to the Claimant is as follows,
“Kevan Thakrar (DC) – The local team have reported that Mr Thakrar has had a very poor month(s) in terms of both behaviour and engagement. Mr Thakrar is reported as being back on back wall unlock protocol due to threats made to staff and is back on an open ACCT document. His engagement with staff is reported as being minimal, only engaging when he required something and actively ignores the unit governor. It is noted that he has declined psychology sessions offered to him in the segregation unit and there has been discussion with him in regard to him actively influencing other prisoners in a negative manner.
In order for Mr Thakrar to progress, he needs to engage with the local MDT and to take up on the offered psychology sessions, with a view to reducing the risk he currently presents, before overall risk reduction can be addressed in line with his CMP. He is appropriately placed in the CSC estate at this time.”
The Move to Belmarsh
On 31 August 2021 he was transferred to a DC at HMP Belmarsh. He complains about this move to HMP Belmarsh and his continued detention there. At the time of the move, he was involved in civil proceedings at Central London County Court. His solicitors had requested that he be available to attend court in those proceedings.
Those proceedings were blighted by the Defendant’s disclosure failings. They were eventually resolved in the Claimant’s favour. On 4 January 2022 the defence was struck out and on 17 August 2022 the Defendant’s claim for relief from sanction was refused.
The Claimant did ask to be moved to HMP Belmarsh, and his solicitors did ask that he be able to attend court. He appears to deny making such a request. I have no doubt that his solicitors have acted diligently on his behalf throughout and that they quite properly made the request on his instructions and with his knowledge.
As an alternative he appears to maintain that even if such a request was made, that fact has been deliberately exploited by the Defendant to justify the time he has spent at HMP Belmarsh.
He says that the request that he be made available to attend court did not necessitate his being moved to Belmarsh at all. The letter from his solicitors is dated 4 August 2021. It did request that he be produced at court for the duration of the trial.
“[i]t is in the interests of justice that our client is able to attend the trial in person, as it is necessary that he be able to provide us with his confidential instructions on the evidence and issues that arise at the trial, and so that he can give evidence in person about the breaches of his human rights.”
Given the Claimant’s status in the prison regime, a move to London to attend court was bound to take him to HMP Belmarsh.
His solicitors were right to request that he be available to attend court. It was right that the request was granted. The Claimant would have been justifiably unhappy if he had not been able to attend the trial.
Having been placed in a DC at HMP Belmarsh, he was promoted back to Enhanced Incentives and Earned Privileges status (“IEP”). HMP Belmarsh does not have a CSC unit so he would have to stay in a DC until moved to another prison. He has since been moved to a CSC in HMP Manchester in May 2023.
His belief that his move to the segregation unit at HMP Belmarsh was “a straight swap” with a white, racist prisoner replicates what he says was the position when he was moved from the CSC to the segregation unit in HMP Whitemoor to allow preferential treatment to another, highly dangerous, white racist prisoner. Further, he adds that a similar move was attempted for another racist prisoner. He describes this as his “being bounced around to enable the CSCMC to do favours for racist prisoners”.
The CSCMC monthly review dated September 2021 shows a record that he has “worked well with staff and has remained polite and well-mannered in all interactions”. The document also notes that his transfer “was facilitated following a request from his solicitor for an impending court case and to engage with a fresh team”. The Claimant has noted the word “False” alongside that entry on the document.
A conversation between the Claimant and a prison officer about his move to Belmarsh was recorded on a body worn camera on 1 September 2021.  In that discussion he said that he had requested to come to Belmarsh as he had a case in the County Court, in which he was suing the prison service.
On 18 January 2023 the Claimant said he wished to remain at Belmarsh until his impending case was finished.
In the generality of his evidence, he describes the conditions under which he has been routinely held since 2010 as “amounting to solitary confinement”. He sets out a history of a scheme which previously operated, the “Continuous Assessment Scheme (“CAS”). In dealing with that scheme he says, “knowing the history only reinforces the feelings of powerlessness to bring about change and indicates to me the lack of care and compassion, by those managing the process”.
The Claimant’s Evidence
The Claimant has made lengthy witness statements, which I have read and considered carefully. I highlight certain aspects but that must be understood to be highlights only, I have read the material and do not attempt to replicate it here.
He emphasises that he presents no risk to staff or other prisoners. He points out that there have been no adjudications resulting in punishment of confinement to his cell. He relies heavily on his acquittal following the incident at HMP Frankland. He maintains that his segregation has been brought about as part of a deliberate plan based on the bad faith of HMPPS to treat him unfairly and therefore unlawfully.
He maintains that he is only “refusing” to engage in assessments and/or therapy that would be detrimental to him. He submits that there is a sound evidential basis for his diagnosis of suffering from PTSD and that it is therefore not appropriate for the prison authorities to investigate that further. He argues that his condition means that it would be detrimental to him for any assessment or therapy sessions not to be conducted on his terms. He has set those terms out in a document, which specify how such sessions should be conducted and that no third person should be present.
He says, “I have always expressed a willingness to engage with specified interventions as long as they are offered under conditions which are therapeutic and conducive to my mental health”.
A desire to bring about change in the system and his frustration at not being able to control events seems to underpin his account. He clearly feels powerless to control his own situation. Being in prison inevitably denies an individual control over their own situation. That is the punitive element of the deprivation of liberty.
He often feels that his detention in “segregation” is being arranged or maintained only to cause him “severe psychological harm”.
He usually refers to the segregation system as “solitary confinement”. It is not difficult to understand his profound dislike of the regime. However, on the authorities, the segregation regime applied in this case, does not amount to total solitary confinement, as per Singh LJ in R (Dennehy) v SSJ and Sodexo Ltd [2016] EWHC 1219 (Admin),
Applying the principles which can be derived from the authorities on Article 3 to the facts of the present case, it seems to me that the following features of this case are of particular importance.
First, there is no suggestion that the Claimant has been kept in segregation with the intention of debasing or humiliating her; nor any suggestion that the measure was calculated to break her resistance or will. There has been no element of premeditation in the sense used by the European Court of Human Rights.
Secondly, the segregation regime has not amounted to total solitary confinement and has been modified as conditions have permitted.  For example, the Claimant has been permitted to communicate with some other people; has been able to do some work as an orderly and has had access to facilities such as a library and a gym.
Thirdly, although the Claimant suffers from a mental disorder, the impact of segregation on her health has been monitored by professionals, including  psychologists, and it has been certified that she can continue to be kept in that  environment at all relevant times.
Fourthly, the Claimant’s segregation has at all material times had a legitimate aim and has not been imposed for arbitrary reasons. The reality is that the Claimant is in an almost unique position in the prisons of this country.  She poses an exceptionally high risk to others, including other prisoners. This is not to say that the Claimant’s segregation can be indefinite but that is not what the Second Defendant has sought to do.  Rather the evidence before this Court makes it clear that reasonable efforts have been made to facilitate the Claimant’s ability to move to another environment within  the prison estate but only in a safe and structured way.”
One of the difficulties faced by the prison authorities when allocating prisoners is to bear in mind security concerns borne out of existing animosities and tensions between inmates. There are a number of racist prisoners in the LTHSE, and care has to be taken to ensure that prisoners are not placed at risk by the combination of such persons in a unit. The Claimant acknowledges that there are some individuals with whom he should not be held but appears to suggest that this consideration is being used by HMPPS to work to his detriment.
He quotes a conversation between him and a member of staff when it was said that he complains a lot, he answers that he has “a lot to complain about”. Amongst his complaints, are those to be expected from most prisoners about heating, food, transport, shaving, searching and all the daily routine. Additionally, however, he suggests that the guards deliberately failed to wear masks during the pandemic to increase the risk to the prisoners which ignores the fact of an increased risk to themselves. He also cites the fact that when the guards at Belmarsh distribute mosquito cream they hand over an amount of cream rather than passing the tube to him. It is understandable how frustrating restrictions of that kind might be, but those restrictions are neither unfair nor unlawful.
Alex Worsman’s Evidence
Alex Worsman is the chair of the CSCMC and has oversight of the CSC. He has a detailed overview of the CSC estate and can deal specifically with the Claimant’s position. He has provided lengthy and detailed evidence in his witness statement, again, it is not necessary or helpful to recite it in full.
The CSC system provides “a multi-disciplinary risk management approach” to dealing with prisoners who have shown actual violence or disruptive behaviour or who have demonstrated a propensity to create such a risk.
Such prisoners are moved under PR 46 into the CSC and/or a DC. All DCs are located in the segregation units of high security prisons. A prisoner held under PR46 has no contact with “mainstream” prisoners. Only those assessed as suitable to be held in a CSC and/or in a DC can be placed there whilst awaiting or following assessment. In 2023 there was a capacity of 68 spaces, 56 in CSCs and 12 further spaces in DCs. Each unit has an operational manager who works closely with the lead Forensic Psychologist. The purpose is to “safely and humanely manage individuals under PR46, whilst working to engage them in a progressive treatment and intervention plan that is tailored to their individual risk areas and personal needs”. It is clear that the role of the psychologist team is integral to the work of assessment and management of the individuals held on a unit. At the start of a placement all prisoners are subject to a regime which prevents association with others. Any alteration in status follows assessment that the level of risk no longer requires such a restriction.
If a prisoner has to be moved out of a CSC unit, they can be held in a DC. There is no upper limit on the time of such a placement. The CMG and CSCMC meet monthly to review such placements, it is the aim to relocate a prisoner back into a CSC as soon as it is appropriate and operationally possible.
The CSCMC works to allocate prisoners back into a CSC, with access to psychological intervention, if there is a willingness to engage in “progressive work”. This question of a “willingness to engage” is at the core of the Claimant’s case. It has effectively led to stalemate.
The CSCMC has devolved authority from the Defendant. It is made up of senior officials from the HMPPS and representatives of the operational and clinical leads from the Directorate of Security. An independent person, a senior IMB representative, also sits on the committee. It is intended to provide a “multi-disciplinary approach to assessing an inmate’s progress that is separate from the individual prison in which they are held”.
The meetings concerning the Claimant’s case were chaired by a Governor. However, that was not in compliance with the decision in Bourgass (supra). That has now changed and there is no longer a governor on the CSCMC.
Facilities vary from prison to prison and not all CSCs have the same amenities but all, including the DC’s, have access to social and legal visits and telephone calls, exercise and access to gym facilities, work and education in cell, (if assessed as suitable) and pastoral support. All are visited by a representative of the IMB.
HMP Belmarsh also allows a daily visit to a gym on the segregation unit and one outdoor session per week with a PE instructor. Prisoners have access to primary health care, including mental health services, there are also regular appointments with a psychologist available to an inmate which can enable input into the reporting process. HMP Belmarsh has assessed the Claimant as suitable for educational work and he has been able to complete a maths course.
Although these prisoners are segregated from other prisoners, they have contact with officers, governors, nurses and other medical staff, clerics, IMB representatives in addition to their social and legal visits, that is not properly described as total solitary confinement, see Dennehy (supra). The Claimant had access to a telephone whilst at Belmarsh and his daily average time for social calls between September 2021 and February 2023 was about 150 minutes. That was in addition to legal calls which ranged from five up to 40 minutes a day on average.
Persons held in a CSC have a Care and Management Plan, (“CMP”). It is usually provided in the four weeks after their selection. The CMP identifies the work required to reduce and manage the risk that a prisoner poses. It is axiomatic that risk must be carefully assessed before it can be managed and reduced. The plan is reviewed quarterly to measure conduct and progress and, as appropriate, set new targets. Mr Worsman describes the CMP as the “core of the decision making”, they require active input from the prisoner himself and from all members of the MDT.
Additionally, weekly reports are provided by a Personal Officer who should meet the prisoner to discuss conduct over the previous week. The weekly reports are available to the prisoner on request, although they may be redacted. The weekly report is used to inform a monthly report which is submitted to the monthly CSCMC meeting.
The monthly report goes to the CSCMC meeting to enable the committee to review the decision about placement and possible movement, (de-selection). The report explains why de-selection might not be appropriate and his continued placement in the CSC should continue. It highlights areas of risk, progress, concerns and any other relevant factors.
The monthly reports should be disclosed to the prisoner and/or his legal representative. He is permitted to submit representations which the committee should consider. After the meeting the report is updated, and a copy is provided to the prisoner.
Further, an annual review is undertaken by the MDT to consider the management of the prisoner, which includes any referrals, any consideration of re-categorisation, charges, parole, treatment, any other changes and, in particular the long-term plans. A copy may be disclosed to the prisoner if requested.
The position of a prisoner held in a DC is also reviewed at the CMG monthly meeting. The appropriateness of their continued placement is discussed. The reason for the original placement is looked at against any change of circumstances with a view to whether there should be a recommendation to the CSCMC for a move.
Ultimately the CSCMC makes the decision, having considered the CMG’s recommendation. It may raise the question of location of its own volition. Prisoners and their legal representatives may make representations to be considered by the CMG.
Progress, and movement out of the CSC system can be agreed, if the MDT assesses, and the CSCMC agrees, that the level of supervision and control is no longer necessary. These are decisions reached on an assessment of risk, and any progress made from the original assessment of level of risk.
Above these layers is another body, the CSC Independent Advisory Panel. That is made up of the CSCMC, CMG, Governing Governors and a number of independent experts, including from the Cambridge Institute of Criminology, Oxford University, an Emeritus Professor of Forensic Psychiatry, the Greater Manchester NHS trust, NHS Head of Health and Care partnerships, the Clinical Director of Mersey Care and Clinical Directors of high secure hospitals. Prisoners are allowed to write to this panel raising their concerns. Additionally, a prisoner has recourse to the Prisons and Probation Ombudsman.
Mr Worsman describes the Claimant’s progress as poor since being placed on PR46. Whilst he can be polite and has engaged in educational, vocational and “intervention” work, he is on other occasions hostile, threatening and disruptive. The complaint is that he has targeted staff who challenge his behaviour and, when possible, incites other prisoners to disengage.
He refuses to cooperate with prison psychologists or to engage in assessments unless it is carried out on his terms. He has refused many offers of different arrangements for meeting with the psychologists. He insists that meetings should take place as he requires. He has written out those terms, he insists that they be on a 1:1 basis, in certain locations and duration but in particular he insists that the psychologist must oppose any plan to move him to another CSC. That was considered to be an attempt at “conditioning and controlling behaviour”.
The Claimant has privately commissioned a number of assessments, which HMPPS have allowed. The reports vary on the diagnosis of PTSD but the most recent commissioned by the Claimant and provided by Dr Craisatti in 2022 (see below) concludes that he probably does not present such a high level of risk and that after assessment he could quite possibly be re-categorised as Category B.
HMPPS have offered an alternative, an Emeritus Professor of Forensic Psychiatry which the Claimant has also declined. This expert was apparently consulted originally by the Claimant.
Issue of non-engagement
The issue of his “non-engagement” is at the core of this case.  The Defendant says that the Claimant refuses to engage, he says that the Defendant refuses to allow him to engage on a proper basis. In reply the Defendant says that the manner in which he seeks to demonstrate his engagement, “on his own terms” is not true engagement and in any event is not viable given his status as a life prisoner. By way of illustration his “willingness”, or otherwise, to work with a psychologist is relied upon by both sides to make their point. The Claimant says that he will work with Dr Craissati, The Defendant has facilitated such consultations but says he also has to work with the Medical team within the HMPPS. They have offered the opportunity to work with the Emeritus Professor, who was apparently previously requested by the Claimant. He now refuses that offer. A stalemate results.
The prison authorities have to manage a large number of prisoners detained at different categorisations and for very different lengths of sentence. For most long-term prisoners there should be scope to work on rehabilitation and re-integration. That can only be undertaken on the basis of full and proper risk assessment and a willingness to engage on both sides.
By way of an illustration. A refusal to accept findings of guilt of sexual offences, after conviction, is not uncommon amongst serving prisoners, (not here), that gives rise to difficulty in terms of sentence planning, in R (Potter) v SSHD [2001] EWHC Admin 1041. How does the system work to rehabilitate an offender who refuses to accept guilt? Sentence planning must be directed at “the individual circumstances” of an offender. A refusal to acknowledge guilt of a sexual offence could lead to a refusal to attend a Sexual Offences Treatment Programme, (“SOTP”) which could lead to a refusal of an application for enhanced status. As Moses J said in Potter, “there is neither anything unfair or irrational in the schemes or in their application to these prisoners in refusing enhanced status on the ground of a refusal to Attend a SOTP in the face and by reason of their denial of their guilt.” The Claimant is not denying his guilt of the murder offences but his inability or unwillingness to engage means that sentence planning, in its broadest sense, cannot be carried out. The risk that he may, or may not, continue to present cannot be assessed and so stalemate is reached.
The Claimant does not accept that the comparison with sexual offenders is an appropriate parallel. It is not the same position, but it is similar and it raises the same questions as to how such a refusal to engage can be managed with the prison estate.
The statutory duties relating to safety of others means that the prison authorities cannot step back and accept his unwillingness to comply. That unwillingness has the same impact, even if passive. A passive refusal is still a deliberate refusal to engage.
Dr Craissati’s report
Dr Craissati met the Claimant on three occasions, the first is described as a chat because he was not happy with the arrangements. The prison made new arrangements which allowed two further meetings to take place in conditions about which he was content. She has seen many previous medical reports, a number of CSCMC plans and monthly reviews for the CSCMC between September 2021 and April 2022.
Dr Craissati was confident that she had the Claimant’s cooperation, and he appeared to be willing to discuss matters with her openly and courteously. He describes feelings of heightened anxiety at various times. He seems to have attributed his PTSD to an assault in 2008, saying that his symptoms appeared after the attack.
She concluded that his risk of violence to prison officers is “moderate” and to civilian staff as “low”. Overall, she assessed his risk as indicating that he should be re-categorised as Category B following six months of being “tested” within mainstream Category A conditions. On her risk assessment there does not need to be two practitioners present in the room during any session.
Dr Craissati envisages a possible plan which should contain the following,
Agreement on the degree and nature of risk posed by Mr Thakrar
Whether there is any outstanding work required before deselection to Category A
What mental health support is appropriate to offer to meet his needs?
Provisional agreement as to what needs to be achieved in Category A (main location)
in order to be considered for recategorization to B
Unsurprisingly, she advocates consideration of the degree and nature of the risk posed before moving on.
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
The Claimant must prove to the required standard that his grounds are made out. The decisions under challenge have been made by individuals with experience and expertise and are made in the course of the exercise of their powers to conduct the business of detaining convicted persons in circumstances that, so far as possible, avoid unnecessary risk, and maintain safety and good order within the LTHSE.
In this review I am not required to consider what decision I would have reached if the original decision was under challenge. I am not required to decide whether I agree with the decisions under challenge. This is not an appeal against the decisions, rather it is a review in order to establish if the decisions taken are unlawful, procedurally unfair or irrational, and if unlawful, that any error would have made a material difference to the decision under challenge.
GROUNDS OF CHALLENGE
There is a degree of overlap between the grounds of challenge, it is not easy to separate them clearly one from the other. That is perhaps inevitable in a challenge of this kind. However, it does mean a certain degree of overlap in the discussion on the separate grounds. Ground 1 is obviously the principal challenge, and some later arguments stand or fall with that ground.
Ground 1: the Defendant’s ongoing segregation of the Claimant is in breach of his right to not be subject to inhuman and degrading treatment contrary to Article 3. Having regard to all the circumstances of the Claimant’s segregation, has there been a breach of his rights under Article 3?
The question of the initial placement into segregation is not challenged as amounting to a breach of his Article 3 rights in this claim for review. Has the ongoing placement become a breach in all the circumstances. If the initial placement is not challenged, I must accept it as lawful. When does it become unlawful. Is the passage of time alone enough to change a lawful placement into an unlawful continuation of such a placement or must there be a change in the circumstances justifying the continuation of such a placement.
Further, if his ‘conduct’ justified the original placement, does that require a change in the Claimant’s conduct before it is no longer justified? If the conduct arose, even in part, from the Claimant’s mental health problems, must the Defendant have to be able to assess those problems before making any further decision?
It is for the Claimant to prove, beyond reasonable doubt, that there has been a breach of the prohibition against inhuman and degrading treatment. These are clearly fact specific questions and there can be no general rule as to the length of time of such a placement, save that it should never be for longer than is necessary.
Article 3, in this context, was considered in R (Bary) v SSJ & The Governor of HMP Long Lartin [2010] EWHC 587 (Admin) at [30] per Aikens LJ,
“…………. The cases establish a number of general  principles.  First, Article 3 is absolute.  It imposes a negative obligation upon states to refrain from inflicting serious harm, but also a positive obligation not to adopt practices which expose individuals to such ill-treatment as falls within Article 3. Secondly, it is for the applicant to establish a breach of the prohibition and the standard of proof for that is “beyond reasonable doubt”. Thirdly, a breach will not be established unless the conditions and regime in which the prisoner or detainee was held attained a minimum standard of severity. Fourthly, the assessment of that minimum standard depends on the circumstances of each case, such as the duration of the treatment, its physical or mental effects and, in some cases the sex age and health of the victim.”
In Bary (supra) the Divisional Court considered “harsh” regimes and at [31- 32],
Both counsel referred us to the ECtHR decision of Van der Ven v Netherlands, and submitted that it gave useful guidance. The case concerned intrusive strip searches. The ECtHR found that the detention and the general regime under which the applicant had been held were not in breach of Article 3.
At paragraphs 48 – 51 the court confirmed the following additional points.  First, in deciding whether Article 3 has been breached,  the purpose of the treatment  is important; in particular whether its purpose was to humiliate or debase the victim. Secondly, in order to decide whether a detention constitutes inhuman or degrading treatment, both the cumulative  effect of the conditions and the specific allegations of the victim have to be  considered.  Thirdly, the fact of detention in a high security prison facility,  either  on remand or following conviction,  cannot by itself be a breach of Article 3.
But the court does have to examine the effect of the regime on the person concerned.  A state must:
“ensure that a person is detained in conditions which are compatible with respect  for his human dignity, that the manner and method of the execution of the measure do not subject him to distress or hardship of an intensity exceeding the unavoidable level of suffering inherent in detention and that, given the practical  demands of imprisonment, his health and well-being are adequately secured”
Lastly, the court stated that complete sensory isolation, coupled with total social isolation, can destroy the personality and constitutes a form of inhuman treatment which cannot be justified by the requirements of security or any other reason. But the removal from social association with other prisoners for (e.g.) security or protection reasons does not of itself amount to inhuman or degrading treatment. In order to decide whether such treatment breaches Article 3:
“...regard must be had to the particular conditions, the stringency of the measure, its duration, the objective pursued, and it effects on the person concerned”.
Even harsh regimes may not be in breach of Article 3, if the regime is justified by the particular risks presented by the prisoner.  Thus, restrictive regimes have been upheld in the case of high security prisoners who pose serious security risks.  So in the case of Ocalan v Turkey,  the applicant was the leader of the Kurdish separatist group known as the PKK.  He was kept in solitary confinement on a remote island, where he had contact only with prison staff,  although he had access to books,  newspapers and a radio.   He saw a doctor every day and lawyers and his family once a week.  The Grand Chamber found that the general conditions in which he had been detained had not “thus far reached the minimum level of severity required” to come within Article 3.”
The Court went on to deal specifically with the obligation on prison authorities to “protect the mental health” of prisoners. Conditions capable of being justified for prisoners not suffering from mental illness may be, or become, inhuman or degrading treatment if a prisoner suffers from some types of mental illness. That is a question of degree to be determined on the facts of each case.
Notwithstanding that the court was satisfied that Mr Bary was vulnerable on account of his pre-existing mental health problems, it found that he had failed to prove to the necessary standard that the regime imposed upon him amounted to inhuman or degrading treatment such that his Article 3 rights had been breached. The court found that his mental health condition imposed a “duty to monitor” the effect of any change of regime upon him. They found that the change of regime had, in combination with other factors, brought about a change from “moderate” to “moderate to severe” in his condition.
At [36] the Court set out the general approach to be taken,
“There is, therefore, no test of universal application; it all depends on the facts of the individual case.  We must examine, among other matters: the physical conditions in which the detainees are held; the regime to which they are subject; the extent to which they are segregated or isolated from other prisoners; the risk they present to staff within the prison; the risk  of escape and the dangers which they would present to the public and to the public interest if they were to escape; the risks they present to themselves, by way of self-harm; the risk they present to other prisoners, not in this case so much by way of direct violence but by way of propagandising or ‘radicalising’ them; whether the risks which they present justify and/or are proportionate to the conditions and regime in place; whether the conditions or regime have been imposed for the purpose of humiliating, embarrassing or punishing them or for some other base or sinister motive; whether and in what respects the detainees are vulnerable, whether by reason of existing physical or mental condition or otherwise; the length of time to which they are subject to these conditions and to this regime; the contact which they  have with their families; the medical and psychiatric services which were made  available to them and the effect that the conditions and regime have had upon them and their physical and mental state of health. It is for the court to balance all these matters, before deciding whether the applicant has proved, beyond reasonable doubt, that there has been a breach of Article 3.”
To amount to a breach the conditions must attain a minimum level of severity, that minimum level is assessed from a starting point that detention inevitably causes suffering and humiliation. The loss of liberty and family life alone cause that.
Bad faith in the decision-making process would mean that the measure was not lawful as not being demonstrably necessary and proportionate, Ahmad v UK (2013) 56 EHRR 1 at [212],
“Finally, in order to avoid any risk of arbitrariness resulting from a decision to place a prisoner in solitary confinement, the decision must be accompanied by procedural safeguards guaranteeing the prisoner’s welfare and the proportionality of the measure. First, solitary confinement measures should be ordered only exceptionally and after every precaution has been taken, as specified in para.53.1 of the European Prison Rules. Secondly, the decision imposing solitary confinement must be based on genuine grounds both ab initio as well as when its duration is extended. Thirdly, the authorities’ decisions should make it possible to establish that they have carried out an assessment of the situation that takes into account the prisoner’s circumstances, situation and behaviour and must provide substantive reasons in their support. The statement of reasons should be increasingly detailed and compelling as time goes by. Fourthly, a system of regular monitoring of the prisoner’s physical and mental condition should also be put in place in order to ensure that the solitary confinement measures remain appropriate in the circumstances. Lastly, it is essential that a prisoner should be able to have an independent judicial authority review the merits of and reasons for a prolonged measure of solitary confinement.”
What amounts to a prolonged detention and whether it is an unnecessary prolongation is also entirely fact specific. It should not be longer than is necessary on the facts of a given case. Additionally, the nature of the segregation is also highly relevant. Social isolation is avoided or mitigated by contact with staff, medical teams, lawyers, independent monitors, family, clerics and others. Such daily contacts are part of the pattern within segregation, the quality and quantity of such contact cannot be isolated or separated from the question of the duration of segregation. It is all part of the picture to be assessed. The less contact with others, the greater the impact of segregation and the more the passage of time becomes a concern.  The number of social and legal visits and calls also form part of the picture. The Claimant has a significant number of visits and telephone contact with others.
As is clear in, Ramirez Sanchez v France (2007) 45 EHRR 49 at [139], the decision to segregate and the continuing decisions to maintain segregation must be conducted with absolute procedural fairness. Such decisions must not be either arbitrary or made in bad faith.
“However, in order to avoid any risk of arbitrariness, substantive reasons must be given when a protracted period of solitary conﬁnement is extended. The decision should thus make it possible to establish that the authorities have carried out a reassessment that takes into account any changes in the prisoner’s circumstances, situation or behaviour. The statement of reasons will need to be increasingly detailed and compelling the more time goes by.
Furthermore, such measures, which are a form of “imprisonment within the prison”, should be resorted to only exceptionally and after every precaution has been taken, as speciﬁed in para.53.1 of the Prison Rules adopted by the Committee of Ministers on January 11, 2006. A system of regular monitoring of the prisoner’s physical and mental condition should also be set up in order to ensure its compatibility with continued solitary conﬁnement.”
Sanchez is a comparatively old case, and no measure of time can be imported from one case into another but more than 8 years did not meet the test for a breach of Article 3 in the facts of that case.
Mr Armstrong submits that contact with persons other than fellow prisoners does not mitigate the isolation. He describes that suggestion as ‘misconceived’. That is particularly so, in light of the Claimant’s mental health problems, which he submits are largely being ignored. He submits that segregation is not justified, reasoned or properly explained and invites the court to find that this is being done in bad faith to “break the Claimant’s will and/or resistance”.
Clearly the court in Dennehy did not agree with the submission that contact with other persons, even if not other inmates, does not mitigate the impact of segregation. The Claimant has social visits and a significant amount of telephone contact with family and friends. Whilst from his perspective contact with his legal team, medical teams, civilian staff and pastoral visitors may not be of the same value as contact with other prisoners, it is nonetheless contact with others. It prevents or mitigates the sense of deprivation of human contact which is part of his argument. Although the Claimant does not accept that it has any value, there is additionally regular contact with prison staff.
Daily life on a CSC or even in a DC is far from what an individual, in this case Mr Thakrar would choose, but it cannot be said to reach the very high level of ill-treatment required to be classified as a breach of his Article 3 rights. I cannot find any evidential basis for the contention that his placement is being deliberately maintained in bad faith to break his will or resistance. In reality a minimal amount of engagement might well have brought about a relaxation in the strictness of the regime.
I have carried out a rigorous examination of the evidence presented by the parties. I cannot find an evidential basis that the continuation of the Claimant’s removal from association reaches “the minimum level of severity which is necessary for article 3 to apply”, as described by Lord Reed in R(AB) v SSJ [2021] 3 WLR 494.
In that case the duration of the ‘treatment’ was a relevant factor but was only one of a number of relevant factors to be considered. There are, as the Supreme Court observed, no ‘precise rules and no limit or definition of time has been laid down. As, is always the case, each claim turns on its own facts. Sanchez provides nothing more than an example of how a very lengthy period of detention in segregation may still not amount to a breach of the detained person’s Article 3 rights.
Mr Armstrong further argues that the Claimant’s mental health is highly relevant and should weigh heavily in the balance. He is right to say that an individual’s mental health can be a highly relevant factor, see R (AB), but it is a factor which has to be evaluated before it can be given its appropriate weight in the assessment. The Claimant has demonstrated that he is capable of undertaking an interview and assessment with a psychologist, but he insists on choosing which psychologist. Even when offered an individual he has previously selected he refuses. HMPPS should consider the report of Dr Craisatti as part of their assessment, but they must be permitted to have an assessment carried out by one of their own team of experts. A choice as to which doctor should treat a prisoner may well be one of those rights lost with incarceration, it is not a right available to most patients outside the prison system.
Ground 2: the Defendant’s policy on the use of DC’s, as set out in the CSC Long Term and High Security Estate: Operating Manual (April 2017), (“the Operating Manual”), is unlawful because it gives rise to a significant risk of breaches of prisoners’ rights under Article 3 of the Convention.
Is the Defendant’s policy in the Operating Manual unlawful on the basis that it gives rise to a significant risk of ill-treatment, of a level that would breach Article 3 because it lists among the circumstances in which a DC would be appropriate where a prisoner “refuses to comply with any regime or intervention offered to them including passive refusal”?
“Designated cells (DCs) are a resource available to the CSCMC and must only be used for CSC prisoners to ensure adequate Rule 46 cells are available across the High Security and Long Term Estate. Such locations are appropriate when it becomes necessary to temporarily remove prisoners from the main CSC units. These cells are termed Designated Cells as they are designated by the Director with the delegated authority of the Secretary of State for the purpose of holding Rule 46 prisoners only. The aim of the system is to accommodate CSC prisoners within the main units to carry out the work identified for them, however there are a range of circumstances for which a DC would be appropriate;
 For prisoners within CSC units, either through disruptive, subversive, manipulative, or violent behaviour, who refuse to comply with any regime or intervention offered to them, including passive refusal, and/or is disrupting the regime to the detriment of other prisoners located on the unit;
 For whom a move would be in the best interests of their, or another prisoner’s physical and/or mental well-being;
 For an adjudication hearing (although as a last resort, as Video link should be attempted first);
 To facilitate an adjudication award;
 For compassionate reasons;
 To facilitate the reasonable management of prisoners within the system (see below)*;
 To enable a period of accumulated or inter-prison visits;
 As contingency accommodation in the event that a unit has to be decanted to facilitate maintenance work, or is evacuated following an incident.
*Facilitating the ‘reasonable management’ of prisoners may include the need to transfer a prisoner due to conflicts with individual prisoners, or to enable another prisoner to be brought into the CSC system for assessment, treatment, or progression, to address staff well-being, to enable cells to be allocated to another prisoner where a priority need is identified, pending allocation to a CSC unit, or to manage witness conflicts where an offence has been committed within the CSC.”
Mr Armstrong’s submissions on this ground are based upon the Claimant’s contention that the decision to continue his placement in a DC was reached because it punishes him and is intended to compel him to comply. That is not supported by the evidence. At the risk of repetition, the decision to place him originally is not challenged. There are grounds for maintaining that placement and those grounds are regularly reviewed.
As Lord Reed made clear in Bourgass (supra) such placements do not involve a finding of fact and are not punitive measures. The Claimant’s argument must therefore be that there is no lawful basis for the continued placement, and it is being imposed on him as an unlawful punishment. I cannot find any evidential basis to prove or support that assertion. It would require a large group of people internal and external to HMPPS to be working together to keep him in a DC for no good reason, and in particular for the bad reason of inflicting damaging and potentially dangerous punishment on him.
This ground further argues, that a common law duty to provide reasons, it is agreed that such a duty does exist, is not sufficient and that the policy risks a breach of Article 3 because it does not include a specific reference to such a duty. If a duty exists and is acknowledged by those whom it compels and is complied with in proper form, then the argument that it should also be written into the policy cannot be sustained. It might mean that every policy document would be required to include every common law duty. That would be unnecessary in general, and it is not required in the specific facts of this case.
Ground 3:  in breach of common law requirements of procedural fairness, the Defendant has failed and continues to fail to give proper reasons for the Claimant’s ongoing segregation.  Has the Defendant so failed? The duty to provide sufficient reasons is a common law duty.
The Supreme Court in Bourgass makes it clear that a person in the Claimant’s position is entitled to know “the substance” of what is being said in sufficient detail to enable him to respond. His right to know is only met if he is provided with sufficient detail. Mr Armstrong submits that the reasons given by HMPPS are insufficient. In this ground he comes back to the reasoning behind the move to HMP Belmarsh, he argues that the Defendant was wrong to suggest that the Claimant knew he had been moved to Belmarsh at the specific request of his solicitor to be available for the proceedings at the Central London County Court. The solicitor’s letter does make that specific request, and I can find no basis to conclude that that was written otherwise than in compliance with the Claimant’s instructions. He quite rightly wanted to be able to attend the hearing, the solicitors, quite rightly did what they could to relay that request. The Defendant facilitated his request to be available for the hearing by moving him to a London prison, HMP Belmarsh and he had known since January 2023 that they were planning to move him out of HMP Belmarsh, (as in fact happened in May 2023).
The reasoning behind the original placement is set out in full in the letter of 9 April 2021. The periodic reviews were provided to the Claimant and his legal representatives. He further received the weekly reviews, the monthly reports from the MDT and his quarterly CMP reviews. The Claimant has always made sure that he seeks information. He has always known, though not accepted, that his continuing placement was explained by his refusal to engage.
Ground 4: in breach of her own policy, as set out in the CSC Operating Manual, the CSCMC failed to review the Claimant’s segregation at each monthly meeting. Has there been a failure by the Defendant to follow the guidance in the Operating Manual on the basis of a failure to conduct separate reviews of the Claimant’s segregation in a DC (ie separate from the reviews of his ongoing placement under PR 46?).
In R (Awale) v SSJ [2024] EWHC 2322 (Admin) Ellenbogen J considered submissions in a case involving a man whose progress had been assessed and who had been considered to have made sufficient progress to be able to be returned to association but was not provided with any other prisoner to associate with. The Defendant had argued, in that case, that because a direction under PR46(3) had been given, the CSCMC was only obliged to consider A‘s placement in the CSC estate and was not required to review his continuing removal from association. Ellenbogen J disagreed with that submission and found that the Defendant was bound to review both parts of the directions and give reasons, namely placement in the CSC and removal from association with other prisoners.
The Claimant argues that the decision in Awale has a direct bearing on this case and that ‘separate’ consideration should have been given to the question of placement in a CSC and segregation or removal from association. The Defendant argues that that did, in fact, happen in this case. Mr Grodzinski points out that the CSCMC have always considered the Claimant’s placement in a DC separately from his continuing to be subject to PR46. Accordingly, he submits that the required reviews have, in fact, always taken place. He argues that consideration was consistently given to his continued placement in a DC ‘in the context of’ his PR46 detention. It is clear from the records of the CSCMC meetings that such consideration was given to the Claimant’s ongoing placement.
Ground 5: the Defendant’s ongoing segregation of the Claimant is in breach of his right to a private and family life under Article 8 of the Convention (taken with section 6(1) of the HRA).
Article 8 of the Convention guarantees,
Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life, his home and his correspondence.
There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security, public safety or the economic well-being of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.
The Claimant argues that his rights under Art 8(1) are unlawfully breached by his continuing segregation,
The Defendant has conceded that this interference was not in accordance with the law because the CSCMC included acting prison governors, was/is the interference also not in accordance with the law on the basis of the court’s findings on ground 3 and/or 4?
Was/is the interference in pursuit of a legitimate aim?
If so, was/is the interference proportionate?
The Claimant alleges that segregation is being used to compel him to undertake psychological assessments.
Has there been such a use?
If so, does that constitute an interference with the Claimant’s rights under Article 8(1)?
If so, is it in accordance with the law?
Is this in pursuit of a legitimate aim?
If so, is the interference proportionate?
The Defendant accepts that Article 8(1) is engaged in this case. Taking the second limb of ground 5 first, I have not found that the evidence in the case supports the contention that the Defendant is using segregation as means to compel the Claimant to undertake psychological assessment. The fact that if the Claimant consented to engage in psychological assessment that would be a step towards permitting an assessment of risk and therefore reducing the need for segregation is not to say that there is a plan to compel him to undergo assessment and segregation is a means of achieving that outcome. It is therefore not necessary to answer questions ii), iii), iv) and v). Any answer is likely to be determined by the facts of an individual case, and so, whilst it is not necessary it would also not be helpful.
The Claimant does succeed on this ground, in that the decisions were unlawful because they were not undertaken in accordance with proper procedure. It was thought that an ‘acting governor’ could fill the role of the Secretary of State in making decisions about PR46. Bourgass makes it clear that that should not have been the constitution of the committee making the decisions. The Defendant concedes that point. The Claimant is entitled to declaratory relief to that effect. That is just satisfaction for the breach. It is not argued that the committee, if comprised of representatives of the Secretary of State rather than acting governors would have reached a different decision.
Ground 6: the Defendant’s policy on the use of DCs, as set out in the Close Supervision Centres (CSC) Long Term and High Security Estate: Operating Manual (April 2017), is unlawful because its application inevitably results in decisions which involve a disproportionate interference with the Article 8 rights of the prisoners to which it is applied.
Is the Defendant’s policy as set out in the Operating Manual unlawful on the basis that it will inevitably result in some decisions that involve a disproportionate interference with the Article 8 rights of prisoners segregated in DC’s because it lists among the circumstance in which a DC would be appropriate where a prisoner refuses to comply with any regime offered to them including “passive refusal”?
This ground is argued on the basis that a ‘passive refusal’ to engage in psychological assessment will be met by prolonged placement in segregation in order to compel compliance. As above, I do not find that that is the reason behind the continued placement in segregation in this case. In this context passive appears to mean without active response or resistance. Putting any question of a violent response to one side, I cannot see the distinction to be drawn between an active refusal,  such as saying “I will not” or a moving away and a passive response in which nothing is said or done but the proposed course is nonetheless refused. There is no question of a violent response in this case. If the law permits HMPPS to require an assessment to measure risk when considering the decision to segregate or return from segregation, then HMPPS are entitled to require such an assessment be carried out and a refusal means the risk assessment is not completed and the decision to return cannot be safely made. If there is a basis for a placement, as here, and if a refusal to engage prevents the completion of an assessment, then the interference is not disproportionate.
Ground 7: requires permission, and in any event, Mr Armstrong does not seek to argue that the review should succeed on this ground alone.He submits that the Defendant’s ongoing segregation of the Claimant is in breach of his right not to be subject to discrimination in the enjoyment of his Convention rights under Article 14, taken with Articles 3 and 8 of the Convention.  This is on the basis that the Claimant (and others in his position) are subject to unjustifiable differences in treatment, as compared to non-CSC prisoners who are segregated, in respect of the review/scrutiny of his segregation.
As to the Claimant’s complaint under Article 14,
Does the Claimant’s segregation fall within the ambit of Article 3 and/or Article 8?
Are prisoners such as the Claimant, who are segregated under PR46 in a relevantly similar situation to prisoners segregated under PR 45?
If so, has there been a relevant difference of treatment?
If so, is that difference of treatment based on the Claimant’s status within the meaning of Article 14?
If so, is that difference in treatment justified?
Article 14 of the Convention prohibits discrimination as follows,
“The enjoyment of the rights and freedoms set forth in this Convention shall be secured without discrimination on any ground such as sex, race, colour, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, association with a national minority, property, birth or other status”.
This ground is predicated on the basis that prisoners held on PR 45 are in a relevantly similar situation to those held under PR46. Further, the Claimant seeks permission to argue that his “other status” is his being a CSC prisoner held under PR46.
PR45 allows a governor to remove a prisoner from association for up to 72 hours and to renew that for periods up to 14 days, any period of more than 42 days has to be authorised by the SSJ. PR46 allows removal from association followed by an assessment period of 4 months. The removal is assessed and reviewed by the CSCMC on a monthly basis. Whilst both rules authorise a removal from association, they are different both in their process and impact.
This ground is not properly arguable, even if it were not dependent on earlier findings of any breach of Article 3. Prisoners held under PR 45 or 46 are not in the same or a similar position. The purpose and safeguards within the rules are not the same or sufficiently similar to engage Article 14.
CONCLUSIONS
Applying the burden and standard of proof I have not found that the continuing placement of the Claimant was in breach of his Article 3 rights against ill treatment or inhumane or degrading treatment. I do not prejudge the outcome of any challenge to the original placement and whether that will succeed. On the evidence in this review the Claimant has not achieved the high standard required to prove his challenge.
A number of the points raised in this case were foreshadowed inBourgassby the Supreme Courtat [122] on the general right to association and at [125] et seq on removal from association,
“……. a prisoner has no private law right to enjoy the company of other prisoners. Some degree of association is, of course, a normal feature of imprisonment; and rule 45 is based on that premise. Nevertheless, a prisoner does not possess any precisely defined entitlement to association as a matter of public law. The amount of time which he is permitted to spend outside his cell, and the degree of association which he is in consequence permitted to have with other prisoners, will depend on an assessment by the prison authorities of a variety of factors, such as the number and characteristics of the prisoners held in the prison, the number of staff on duty, security concerns, disturbances in the prison, and other contingencies such as industrial action by prison officers. The extent of association may therefore vary from one prison to another and from one day to the next. It is thus dependent on the exercise of judgment by those responsible for the administration of the prison. That conclusion is not inconsistent with that exercise of judgment being subject to review on public law grounds. There is however no analogy with the circumstances in which article 6.1 has been applied to disputes arising in public law.”
[125] “ The critical question is whether the prisoner’s continued segregation is justified having regard to all the relevant circumstances. Those will include the reasonableness of any apprehension that his continued association with other prisoners might lead to a breakdown in good order and discipline within the prison; the suitability of available alternatives; the potential consequences to the prisoner if authorisation is granted; and the potential consequences to others if it is not. The answer to the question requires the exercise of judgment, having regard to information and advice from a variety of sources, including the governor, health care professionals and the prisoner himself.
[126]“In proceedings for judicial review, the court has full jurisdiction to review evaluative judgments of that kind, considering their reasonableness in the light of the material before the decision-maker, whether the appropriate test has been applied, whether all relevant factors have been taken into account, and whether sufficient opportunity has been given to the prisoner to make representations. This court has explained that the test of unreasonableness has to be applied with sensitivity to the context, including the nature of any interests engaged and the gravity of any adverse effects on those interests: see, for example, Pham v Secretary of State for the Home Department (Open Society Justice Initiative intervening) [2015] 1 WLR 1591. The potential consequences of prolonged segregation are so serious that a court will require a cogent justification before it is satisfied that the decision to authorise its continuation is reasonable. It should also be noted that although judicial review does not usually require the resolution of disputes of fact, or cross-examination, that is not because they lie beyond the scope of the procedure. Judicial review is a sufficiently flexible form of procedure to enable the court to deal with the situation before it as required: see, for example, R (Wilkinson) v Broadmoor Special Hospital Authority [2002] 1WLR 419.
Applying what Lord Reed described as the critical test of whether the continuing segregation is justified on all the relevant circumstances, I do not find that the Claimant has discharged the burden of establishing that it was not.
The Claimant has established the breach alleged in ground 5 and succeeds on that ground. He should have the declaratory relief that he seeks.

.............................
Aidan Eardley :
This is my second judgment on certain preliminary issues in this case, namely - for the purposes of the libel aspect of the claim - the meaning of the statements complained of, whether they are statements of fact or expressions of opinion, and whether they are defamatory at common law. The background is set out in my judgment of 1 August 2024, [2024] EWHC 1976 (KB) (my First Judgment) and I adopt the defined terms I used there. I also direct myself by reference to the legal principles set out in my First Judgment and do not need to repeat them here.
The claim concerns articles published on the Defendant’s Substack and comments posted in response to those articles. The statements complained of are referred to in the Amended Particulars of Claim as “Publication 1” through to “Publication 7”. Under the heading “Publication 4” the Amended Particulars of Claim complain about an article (the Article) and a number of comments. In my First Judgment I was able to determine the meaning of the Article, read in isolation, but I considered that the parties’ cases were too unclear to allow me to make any determinations about the comments: see [60]-[72].
I made an order, in terms agreed between the parties, providing that, if the Claimant wished to pursue his case on the comments, he should serve a further statement of case clarifying his position. The Claimant decided to pursue his claim in relation to some of the comments and filed his Further Statement of Case on 4 September 2024. The order required the Defendant to serve a responsive statement of case, which the Defendant did on 25 September 2024.
In accordance with the mechanism provided for in the order, the Defendant wrote to the Court asking for the outstanding preliminary issues in relation to the comments to be determined at a hearing. Having reviewed the further statements of case and the Claimant’s objections to this proposed course, I determined that a hearing was indeed necessary and it was fixed for 24 January 2024.
On Saturday 18 January 2025 (so, less than a week before the hearing) the Claimant produced an Amended Further Statement of Case. Taking a pragmatic approach, the Defendant has agreed that the Claimant should be permitted to rely on this amended document. The Defendant has responded to it in his skeleton argument rather than amending his own Further Statement of Case, which I regard as acceptable given the time constraints.
The parties have also collaborated to produce an agreed document called “How comment posts work on Substack” in order to resolve some of the factual uncertainties that plagued the last hearing. The final agreed version of this document reached me about 30 minutes before the hearing.
In light of these developments the issues have been helpfully narrowed and clarified. There is almost complete agreement on the approach I should take, in particular on the previously vexed question of what should count as “context” for any particular comment.
The Claimant’s revised case
The Claimant now complains of only 3 comments, referred to as Publications 4(1), 4(2) and 4(3). He accepts that the Article itself is admissible context for the interpretation of each of these comments.
Publications 4(1) and 4(2) both occurred as part of the same short thread. That thread developed as follows (I have added the agreed timing of the posts):
William A. Ferguson Writes William’s Newsletter  [24.10.21, 17:51]

I'll just go ahead and say the quiet part out loud and Paisley can fucking try sue me: he's a nonce, straight up.

Graham Linehan [25.10.21, 11:30]
mate, you're throwing about actionable statements on my site. And
it's not the first time I've had to step in. If you don't like it, happy to
refund you. This isn't Kiwi Farms.
The parties agree that any reader who read any particular comment in this thread would also have read all the other comments in the thread that were available to view at that time.
Publication 4(1) is the first of these comments (the “nonce” comment). It was deleted by the poster at some point. No one is able to say precisely when this occurred. Deletion meant that, in the same position as previously (i.e. at the head of the thread) there was an entry that said “deleted” (in place of the poster’s name) and “comment deleted” instead of the text of the comment.
Miss Skinner KC, for the Claimant, accepts that, in principle, the meaning of Publication 4(1) falls to be re-assessed at the point in time that each new comment in the thread was added. She submits however that the addition of this extra contextual material did not in fact change the meaning. The Claimant does not rely on any other comments on the Article as context, only those forming the thread set out above.
The Claimant’s case is that Publication 4(1) means that he is a paedophile; that it is a statement of fact; and that it is defamatory at common law.
Publication 4(2) is the third comment in the thread set out above (the “Oh I See” comment). Again, Miss Skinner accepted that, in principle, the meaning of Publication 4(2) had to be assessed at different points in time because of the changing contextual material within the thread, but her submission was that the same meaning was conveyed regardless of these changes. Again, no other comments are relied upon as context, only those that appeared in this thread.
The Claimant’s case is that Publication 4(2) means that he is a paedophile; that it is a statement of fact; and that it is defamatory at common law.
Publication 4(3) did not appear in the thread set out above. It was a free-standing comment published on 24 October 2021 at 15:24. It said:
Jeremy Wickins Oct 24, 2021
The child-molesters thought they were on the verge of winning by hitching onto LGB causes via the trans interests. Now they can see their high-risk strategy starting to unravel, and they are going to use all the tricks they know from grooming children to get back at their opponents. Manipulation, threats and coercion are their stock-in-trade, and it leaves us at a bit of a disadvantage. We need to be very vigilant, but Parsley is so thick he's given the game away early.
The Claimant accepts that the only relevant contextual material for Publication 4(3) is the Article itself.
The Claimant’s case is that Publication 4(3) means that he is a paedophile; that it is a statement of fact; and that it is defamatory at common law.
The Defendant’s case
As I have said, the Defendant and the Claimant agree in substance about the contextual material that should be taken into account. However, Mr McCormick KC invites me to take a different analytical approach from that proposed by Miss Skinner. He says that, rather than treating Publications 4(1) and 4(2) as just two statements, whose meaning may change over time due to the changing contextual material, I should analyse them as 5 different statements: 4(1)(a) being the “nonce” comment, as published in isolation for 84 minutes; 4(1)(b) being the “nonce” comment plus the next comment (the “not helpful” comment), which were published together for 32 minutes; 4(2)(a) being the “nonce” comment, the “not helpful” comment and the “Oh I see” comment, which were published together for just under 16 hours; 4(2)(b) being the previous comments plus the final comment (the “mate” comment), which were published together until the time that the “nonce” comment was removed; and 4(2)(c) being the final 4 comments, which were published together but without the “nonce” comment after the “nonce” comment was removed. Mr McCormick reminds me that it is for the Claimant to prove whether the comments were actually published to anyone during any of the relevant timeframes.
The Defendant says that, for the time that the “nonce” comment was published in isolation it would have been understood as mere abuse, or at best an expression of opinion that no-one would take seriously. He says that the addition of the “not helpful” comment will have robbed the “nonce” comment of any defamatory meaning it might have conveyed when read in isolation. He says that the “Oh I see” comment would either be dismissed by the reasonable reader as more “ranting” by “William A Ferguson” or at most as containing a non-defamatory expression of opinion that the Claimant sought to normalise adult male nudity in the presence of children. He says that the addition of the “mate” comment had the effect that no reasonable reader who had seen it would derive any defamatory meaning from either the “nonce” comment or the “Oh I see” comment. He says that once the “nonce” comment was removed, the remainder of the thread ceased to say anything meaningful about the Claimant at all, except perhaps that it would continue to bear (if it ever did) the non-defamatory expression of opinion that he sought to normalise adult male nudity in the presence of children.
The Defendant’s case on Publication 4(3) is that it meant that “The Claimant’s bullying of Ms Black into removing an allegation that he was normalising adult nudity in the presence of children had drawn attention to the issue of child protection involved in that issue”.  The Defendant contends that this was an expression of opinion and accepts that the underlined parts are defamatory at common law.
Discussion
As to the two different analytical approaches adopted by the parties, I prefer Miss Skinner’s submissions. As she rightly says, it is the claimant in a libel action who chooses what statement(s) to sue on. That is their prerogative, so long as they properly identify the statement and provide particulars of publication in accordance with CPR PD 53B, para 4.1. Of the various comments that appeared in the thread, the Claimant has (now) chosen to sue on the “nonce” comment and the “Oh I see” comment. The Defendant cannot interfere with that choice and it is not the Court’s job to reformulate a CPR-compliant case that the Claimant wishes to put before it. If the Defendant wants the Court to take into account other words when determining the meaning of the words the Claimant has chosen to sue on, he must introduce them as admissible contextual material through one of the routes identified by Nicklin J in Riley v Murray [2020] EMLR 20 at [16].
Happily, there is no longer any dispute about what contextual material I need to look at. Neither is it disputed that, in respect of Publications 4(1) and 4(2), I must take a granular approach, assessing meaning at a number of different points in time as the contextual material changed.  However, as to this second point, although there are many cases that grapple with what should be regarded as context for publications on Twitter/X and similar platforms, I am not aware of any case that tackles head on the question of how the Court should deal with material that meets one of the tests for admissibility as relevant context but only for certain periods during the period of publication that a claimant complains of. I think I should therefore explain briefly why I accept that the agreed approach in this case is the correct one. It strikes me as important to address this because it might be argued – at least where this approach is invoked by a claimant – that it is yet another attempt to erode the solid distinction in common law between natural and ordinary meaning (the meaning conveyed to the ordinary reasonable reader) and innuendo meaning (the meaning conveyed to certain readers who have knowledge of particular facts going beyond what can be attributed to the notional ordinary reasonable reader): see Monroe v Hopkins [2017] EWHC 433 (QB) at [40] and Riley v Murray at [17]. It might also be argued that an approach which potentially requires the Court to give multiple rulings on meaning for the same statement assessed at different points in time is highly undesirable and should not be adopted unless strictly necessary.
I start by considering another possible approach, which is to say that contextual material admissible via the routes identified in Riley v Murray can only be taken into account if it was available to all publishees throughout the time that the statement complained of was published. That approach has the attraction of simplicity, and avoids the charge that it involves (without pleading an innuendo) sub-dividing the readership of a statement into groups of readers who had read different things, in breach of the principles identified in Charleston v News Group Newspapers Ltd [1995] 2 AC 65 and Riley v Murray at [16]-[17]. A claimant who wishes to have a particular piece of contextual material included for consideration (or excluded from consideration) could achieve that by limiting their claim to publications occurring during a specified timeframe during which the piece of extraneous material was (or as the case may be, was not) part of the admissible context.
Despite the attraction of its simplicity, this approach would be wrong in my view, for two reasons:
First, it would be unjust to defendants, possibly to the point that it could amount to an unjustifiable interference with their ECHR article 10 rights. Consider the following scenario. An online newspaper publishes an article on a matter of ongoing public interest which includes a paragraph that (read in the context of the article as a whole) is highly defamatory of an individual. The next day, without changing the wording of the offending paragraph, the newspaper amends the online article by adding another paragraph which completely neutralises the sting of the offending paragraph. The individual brings a claim for libel identifying, as the statement complained of, only the offending paragraph, and complaining of publication of that statement from the first date the article was published and continuing. If the “all or nothing” approach I have canvassed above is correct, then any court determining the meaning of the offending paragraph would have to do so without reference to the fact that the article had subsequently been modified in such a way that no reasonable reader looking at the article thereafter would understand the offending paragraph to be saying anything defamatory about the individual. That would be obviously unjust. It is no answer, in my view, to say that a defendant in this dilemma could nevertheless rely on their exculpatory additional text as negativing a case on serious harm under section 1 of the Defamation Act 2013. Serious harm can usually only be determined at a full trial, by which time a defendant will have spent considerable time and money defending the claim. In this scenario, a defendant ought to be entitled to an early ruling that the statement complained of only bore a meaning defamatory of the claimant at common law while published as part of the article in its original form.
Second, it would be contrary to established common law principles, even without consideration of potential ECHR Art 10 infringements. Although it is conventional to plead a case on publication by asserting that “the defendant published [the statement complained of] from [date] and continues to do so” (or similar), the correct analysis at common law is that a new publication occurs every time that the statement is read by a third party. It follows that, in principle, the test for meaning falls to be applied afresh in respect of each such publication, taking into account the relevant contextual material available to the reasonable reader as it stood at the time. It is firmly established that, if the legal analysis applicable to a statement may change at different times during the course of the period it was being published, the Court will have to give separate consideration to the different phases of publication: see e.g. Banks v Cadwalladr [2023] KB 524 at [47] (Warby LJ).
It follows therefore, in my judgement, that meaning falls to be determined afresh when the admissible contextual material has changed in a way that might yield a different determination on meaning in respect of publications of the statement complained of that occur after that change.
As to objections which might be raised to this approach based on considerations of practicality (which are, in any event, irrelevant if the approach is necessary as a matter of law), I suspect that the practical implications are less appalling than they might seem at first blush. The prospect of the Court having to give multiple rulings on meaning in respect of the same statement considered at different times is dispiriting, but it is not something that should occur very often:
First, this is not an exercise that the Court will embark upon of its own motion. Like any other case on context, the contextual material must be pleaded by one or other of the parties before the Court needs to determine its significance: Hijazi v Yaxley-Lennon [2020] EWHC 934 (QB) at [14] (Nicklin J).
Second, the general approach to contextual material, set out in Riley v Murray, will continue to apply, subject only to the requirement to assess the position at various different points in time where that need arises. It will still be necessary for the party making the case to show that, at the relevant point in time, the material fell to be considered via one of the 3 routes identified in Riley (i.e. that it was a matter of common knowledge, that it fell to be treated as part of the “publication” in the Charleston sense, or that it was otherwise material that all readers – from that point on – would have taken into account). If the party cannot establish that the material would have been seen by all readers who read the statement during the specified timeframe, it must be ignored.
Third, a party who invites the court to consider meaning at different points in time on the basis of changes in the contextual material that could only have a trivial impact on meaning, or that could only apply in respect of a very small number of later-occurring publications, will be at risk of having their case struck out, having their case dismissed summarily, or facing adverse costs consequences. A party is likely to be at risk in these regards unless they have a properly arguable case that the additional contextual material was seen by all readers during the period in question, that the article was still being widely read during that period, and that the new contextual material could make a real difference to the issue of meaning (for example by requiring the statement to be placed into a different Chase category or neutralising the sting of the statement altogether).
In the present claim, although it has taken a long time to get here, the parties have finally set out cases which do, in my judgement, give rise to properly triable issues as to whether the meanings of Publication 4(1) and 4(2) changed over time. I must determine those issues.
In this meaning determination, I am revisiting matters that were addressed at length in submissions at the hearing last July, but which I was ultimately unable to determine at that point. I cannot “unhear” the submissions that I heard in July but I have done my best to recall the impression that the comments now complained of made on me when I read them for the first time in preparation for the July hearing. I noted this in my First Judgment at [25]-[26].
Publication 4(1)
Miss Skinner submits that “nonce” is ordinarily understood as a synonym for paedophile. She refers me to Vine v Barton [2024] EWHC 1268 (KB) (Steyn J) where the same term was considered while accepting that every case turns on its own facts. She says that, considered in the context of the Article, which includes a discussion of paedophilia, the reasonable reader would not dismiss this comment as mere vulgar abuse, but an allegation that the Claimant is indeed a paedophile. She submits that the words “I’ll just go ahead and say the quiet part out loud” tell the reader that “William A. Ferguson” is revealing a truth known to others who are too scared to say it. Miss Skinner says that neither the “not helpful” comment nor the “mate” comment draw the sting of the “nonce” comment: they do not state that the “nonce” comment is untrue. On the contrary, she argues, these two comments by the Defendant actually emphasise and intensify the sting. She says that all readers would be aware that, as owner of the Substack account, the Defendant could have deleted the “nonce” post and would infer from the fact that he did not do so that he was tacitly endorsing the views of “William A. Ferguson”.
Mr McCormick accepts that the ordinary meaning of “nonce” is “paedophile” but says that the reasonable reader would not take it at face value. He says the whole tone of the comment is abusive, simply exhibiting extreme dislike for the Claimant (“Paisley can fucking try to sue me”) and that the use of “nonce” is just more abuse. Mr McCormick makes the point that the Article itself does not allege that the Claimant is a paedophile (see my First Judgment at [80]-[81]) and asks why a reader who recognises that to be the case would then understand “William A. Ferguson” to be making that very allegation. Mr McCormick further submits that the comment is clearly an expression of opinion on the contents of the Article, as it offers no other basis for what is said. As to the impact of the “not helpful” comment and the “mate” comment, Mr McCormick says that these show the Defendant disagreeing forcefully with “William A. Ferguson” and that this would deprive the “nonce” comment of any defamatory meaning it might originally have conveyed.
In my judgement, once the Article itself is taken into account as context (as the parties agree it should be) it is not possible to dismiss the “nonce” comment as mere meaningless abuse. The reasonable reader would recognise that much of the Article was devoted to explaining how paedophiles operate and, in that context, would understand “William A. Ferguson” to be making a seriously intended point that this label should also be applied to the Claimant. The fact that the reasonable reader would not understand the Article itself to be making this allegation would not prevent them recognising that “William A. Ferguson” was doing so.
I do not accept Ms Skinner’s submission that the Defendant’s interventions in the thread somehow intensify the sting of the “nonce” comment or that readers would infer, from the fact that it was not immediately deleted, that the Defendant endorsed it. However, I also do not accept that the “not helpful” comment or the “mate” comment (alone or in combination) serve to neutralise or dilute the sting of the “nonce” comment.  This is not a classic bane and antidote case where one part of an article reports an allegation and another part contains a rebuttal by or on behalf of the claimant, causing the reasonable reader to disregard the original allegation. The Defendant is not speaking on behalf of the Claimant in these ripostes or coming to his defence. Indeed, readers would know very well from the Article itself that the Defendant is no ally of the Claimant. The ripostes do not state that the “nonce” comment is false. Neither do they imply this (the reasonable reader - who is not a lawyer – would not pause and try to work out whether that was the implication of “actionable”). Rather, they show that the Defendant considers “William A. Ferguson’s” comments to be a distraction (his point in the Article  being that the Claimant is a bully, not a paedophile) and does not want allegations of paedophilia being thrown around on his Substack, with all the possible legal consequences that that may entail. The reasonable reader would appreciate all this, but none of it would change their understanding of what the “nonce” comment was alleging. It may well be right that the Defendant’s interventions served to undermine the credibility of “William A. Ferguson” in the eyes of readers, such that they would not attach much importance to what he said. But that, it seems to me, is an argument on serious harm, not a point about meaning.
I agree with Mr McCormick however that the “nonce” comment is an expression of opinion. It would strike the reasonable reader as “William A. Ferguson’s” immediate and subjective reaction to what he has read about the Claimant in the Article (“I just  lost my appetite”). I do not accept that “I’ll just go ahead and say the quiet part out loud” would be interpreted as indicating that he has privileged access to some additional information that allows him to “reveal” the Claimant’s paedophilia as a matter of fact. More likely, the reasonable reader would understand these words as an acknowledgment that the Article itself did not go so far as “Willam A. Ferguson” thinks it should have done.
Accordingly, Publication 4(1) means that the Claimant is a paedophile. It is an expression of opinion. It is (as both parties would accept) defamatory at common law.
Publication 4(2)
Miss Skinner submits that the statement that the Claimant “basically wants the right to whip his cock out in front of kids” is an elaboration of the “nonce” comment, telling the reader what kind of “nonce” the Claimant is, namely one who would like the right to brandish his own penis in front of children specifically because he derives paedophilic satisfaction from doing it. She submits that by writing “and you don’t think the shoe fits” “William A. Ferguson” is challenging the Defendant to agree with him that the Claimant is indeed a paedophile (and therefore reiterating that allegation himself).
Mr McCormick’s primary position is that the “Oh I see” comment is just more meaningless abuse from “William A. Ferguson” but, if it does say anything meaningful, it is that “the Claimant seeks to normalise male nudity in the presence of children”, which, he submits is a non-defamatory expression of opinion. As to “the shoe doesn’t fit”, he submits that reasonable readers would recognise this as part of a dispute between the Defendant and “William A. Ferguson” about what is acceptable to post on the Defendant’s Substack, not as a confirmation that the Claimant is a paedophile. Mr McCormick again relies on the “mate” comment as neutralising any sting that the “Oh I see” comment might initially have conveyed. He further submits that, once the “nonce” comment was deleted from the thread, the “Oh I see” comment becomes essentially meaningless because the reader cannot tell what the original allegation was that “William A. Ferguson” is then trying to defend as an acceptable contribution to the Substack.
In my judgement, for so long as the “nonce” comment remained visible to readers, the “Oh I see” comment meant that the Claimant seeks to normalise adult male nudity in the presence of children and is therefore rightly to be described as a paedophile. To a reader who had the Article in mind, the words “basically wants the right to whip his cock out in front of kids” would be seen as summarising, in colourful terms, what the Article says about the Claimant, and bears the same meaning as the Article. “William A. Ferguson” then goes on to assert, in effect, that the “shoe” does “fit”, i.e. that “nonce” is an appropriate term for such a person. To assert, as the Claimant does, that the “Oh I see” post makes a more specific allegation of paedophilia against him, is to ignore its place in the thread. The reader would recognise that this was “William A. Ferguson” explaining why he considered the “nonce” comment to be a relevant and valid contribution to the Substack in the face of the Defendant’s criticism that it was “not helpful”. He is explaining his reasoning, not adding detail to his allegation. The reasonable reader would not dismiss the “Oh I see” comment as meaningless ranting because, like the “nonce” comment, its context is the Article, which involves serious discussion of paedophile behaviour.
For the same reasons already given in respect of publication 4(1), I do not accept that the addition of the “mate” comment did anything to alter the sting of the “Oh I see” comment. However, I do consider that it bore a different meaning once the “nonce” comment was removed from the thread. Readers would still understand the “whips his cock out” part of the comment as a summary of what the Article says about the Claimant, but the words “you don’t think the shoe fits” are meaningless because the reader can no longer see what allegation “William A. Ferguson” made in the first place and which he is now seeking to defend as appropriate. After deletion of the “nonce” comment therefore, only the first limb of the meaning endures.
The allegation that the Claimant normalises adult male nudity in the presence of children is a repetition of the factual allegation in the Article itself and, in those circumstances, can only be seen as a statement of fact. By contrast, the allegation that the Claimant is rightly to be described as a paedophile is a repetition of the opinion that the Claimant has already voiced in the “nonce” comment and would once again be viewed by the reader as an expression of opinion on what is said about the Claimant in the Article.
Both aspects of the meaning are defamatory at common law in my view. That is plain and obvious so far as the paedophilia limb of the meaning is concerned. As to the other limb, I consider that it meets both the “consensus” requirement and the threshold of seriousness. Outside certain specific circumstances, right thinking members of society generally would regard adults parading around naked in front of children as something that is at least highly inappropriate and potentially even harmful. To accuse someone of seeking to normalise such behaviour would, in my judgement, tend to have a substantially adverse effect on how people would treat that person.
Publication 4(3)
Miss Skinner submits that the comment names the Claimant as one of the child-molesters and that he is involved in their “game”, namely the “high-risk strategy” of hitching trans rights to LGB rights as a cloak for child grooming, utilising “manipulation, threats and coercion”, and “tricks” learnt from grooming. She submits that to “give the game away” one has to be a player in the game (i.e. a person who is privy to the strategy that is being pursued). She submits that force is added to her interpretation by the content of the Article, which alleges (in the meaning I have found) that the Claimant has engaged in bullying behaviour (and hence falling within the description of “manipulation, threats and coercion”) and that the Claimant has sought to normalise adult nudity in the presence of children, which the reader would recognise as an instance of the child molesters’ high-risk strategy.
Mr McCormick submits that the comment does not name the Claimant as a child-molester and that, insofar as it says anything about him, it identifies him as a person who is taking a position on trans/LGB issues which child-molesters have hitched on to in order to advance their own  interests. He submits that the comment characterises the Claimant’s statements that are reported in the Article as so stupid as to make it obvious that the child-molesters have hitched on to this trans/LGB debate for their own nefarious reasons, but that the comment does not allege that the Claimant himself is a child-molester.
The comment refers to “Parsley”, not “Paisley” but it is common ground that readers would have understood this as a reference to the Claimant.
In my judgement, the comment means that the Claimant is party to a co-ordinated attempt by child-molesters to manipulate, threaten or coerce those who are trying to expose and defeat their strategy of adopting LGBT causes in order to enhance their ability to groom and abuse children. The comment does not mean, in my view, that the Claimant is himself a child-molester or a groomer.
Since the meaning I have found is significantly different from that advanced by either party, I need to explain my thinking. The starting point is the meaning of the Article itself, which will have been in the reasonable reader’s mind when they read this comment. In my First Judgment at [80] I determined that the Article meant:
“The Claimant bullied Ceri Black into removing an allegation from a Twitter thread that he was spreading an anti-safeguarding line even though that was an apt description of what he does because he seeks to normalise adult nudity in the presence of children. This bullying behaviour is evidence that the Claimant is a dangerous narcissist and misogynist and a vexatious troll who deserves to be charged with wasting police time”.
Notably, therefore, the Article itself did not allege that the Claimant was himself a child-molester, only someone who bullied an opponent of child abuse (Ms Black). For a comment posted in response to the Article to bear the meaning that the Claimant is a child-molester, the allegation would have to be made very explicitly (as it is, in the case of the “nonce” comment). There is no such explicit allegation made in Publication 4(3). The Claimant is not “named” as a child-molester.
The comment is quite dense but I have to contemplate a reader who is interested enough to read the whole of the Article and to go on to read one or more of the comments about it. I do not think that such a reader would lazily conclude that the Claimant must be one of the child-molesters referred to.
There are four strands to the comment which any reader interested enough to read it at all would have identified. First, there is an allegation that child-molesters had adopted the strategy of supporting LGB positions in the trans-rights debate (presumably on such issues as whether there should be spaces such as toilets and changing rooms exclusively reserved for biological females) in order to increase their opportunities to groom or abuse children. Second, there is an allegation that this approach has been called out by the child-molesters’ opponents, such that their strategy is starting to unravel. Third, there is an allegation that the child-molesters have responded to this threat of exposure by resorting to manipulation, threats or coercion. Fourth, there is an allegation that the Claimant has, through his own stupidity, “given the game away”.
In light of this, I cannot accept the Defendant’s submission that the comment merely portrays the Claimant as an innocent participant in the trans-rights debate whose position has been latched on to by child-molesters for their own purposes: there is a clear implication that he is aware of the child-molesters’ agenda and that his bullying behaviour (which readers will recall from the Article) formed part of the “game” they were playing. However, neither can I accept the Claimant’s submission that the comment accuses the Claimant himself of being a child-molester or groomer. That would only be the reaction of an unduly suspicious reader. Read in the context of the Article (which notably does not make these allegations against him) he is only being accused of advancing the child-molesters’ cause. Nevertheless, the reasonable reader would not put this down to naivety on the Claimant’s part. He is accused of “giving the game away” and one can only give the game away if one knows what the “game” is. It is an allegation of knowing assistance.
In my judgement, the reasonable reader would understand Publication 4(3) to be a statement of fact. It is in categorical terms and the writer presents himself as someone with knowledge or experience of what is going on in the child-molesters’ camp (they have, as a matter of fact, pursued a particular strategy and have now switched to attacking those who were calling them out). The allegation that the Claimant is part of their “game” would be taken in the same way: a claim purporting to be based on prior knowledge of the Claimant’s relations with the paedophile community. It would not strike the reader as merely a subjective evaluation of the conduct ascribed to the Claimant in the Article. Only the allegation that the Claimant is “thick” would  come across in that way, and that is not an allegation that needs to be included in the formulation of the meaning.
The meaning I have found is defamatory at common law, as I think both parties would accept.
Conclusion
Each of Publications 4(1)-4(3) are defamatory at common law. They bore the following meanings, which are statements of fact save for underlined text, which was an expression of opinion.

The Claimant is a paedophile

The Claimant seeks to normalise adult male nudity in the presence of children and is therefore rightly to be described as a paedophile.

The Claimant seeks to normalise adult male nudity in the presence of children.
Publication 4(3)
The Claimant is party to a co-ordinated attempt by child-molesters to manipulate, threaten or coerce those who are trying to expose and defeat their strategy of adopting LGBT causes in order to enhance their ability to groom and abuse children.
I have asked the parties to draw up a draft order that reflects this judgment. Paragraph 5 of my order of 1 August 2024 provides that “the costs incurred in any steps taken pursuant to paragraph 2 above [i.e. the mechanism for determining the meaning etc of the comments] be reserved to the hearing/determination of the Preliminary Issues in relation to the Comments”. These costs issues are quite complex and, though I hope they can be resolved without another hearing, they are likely to require a further written judgment. For the time being, I simply invite the parties to agree, in their draft order, a timetable for written submissions on the costs issues.

Appellant
-and-
REGISTRAR OF APPROVED DRIVING INSTRUCTORS
Respondent
Decision: The appeal is Dismissed. The Decision of the Respondent made  on 27 June 2024 is confirmed.
REASONS
This appeal was listed for determination on the papers only, with the agreement of the parties.
The Appellant appealed against a decision of the Respondent dated 27 June 2024, to refuse the Appellant’s application for a second trainee driving instructor licence made on 3 June 2024. The decision of the Respondent was made, taking account of representations made by the Appellant on 11 June 2024, namely, that ‘significant events in his personal life’ had prevented him from pursuing practice with the ‘remaining students allocated to [him]’; that he also had to take time off due to his daughter’s health – attending to her care and hospital appointments – that had taken a ’severe toll’ on his own metal health; that he had to manage the household as his wife was in full-time work; that six months [the duration of a trainee licence] did not ‘factor in’ such unexpected, unfortunate and unforeseen intervening circumstances; that he, himself had been treated in A&E for a ligament injury to his finger, requiring a splint and avoiding pressure on the digit that also contributed to his lack of practice, on the grounds that the Appellant had not complied with the conditions of his first trainee licence by providing a training record in Form AD1 21AT within three months; that the purpose of a trainee licence was to enable the Appellant to gain up to six months to gain sufficient experience to pass his Part 3 test, that, it was submitted, was more than adequate time to do so; that it was not the intention of Parliament that a trainee licence be issued for however long it might take to pass a Part 3 test and that the trainee licence system could not be allowed to become an alternative to registration as a fully-qualified Approved Driving Instructor (’ADI’); that it was not necessary to hold a trainee licence to undertake a Part 3 test; that refusal of an application for a second trainee licence was not a bar to the Appellant undertaking a Part 3 test and that his existing trainee licence remained valid until the determination of this appeal as he had applied for a second trainee licence before expiry of his first trainee licence (thus, in practical terms, allowing the Appellant the benefit of a trainee licence for almost 18 months).
The Appellant submitted an appeal dated 24 July 2024 against the Respondent’s said decision on grounds that corresponded with his written representations to the Respondent on being advised that the Respondent was considering refusing his application. He also submitted a bundle of clinical evidence from April and May 2024 concerning his daughter. There was nothing significant in this evidence to alter the Tribunal’s position. The Appellant also provided four undated photographs of his injured finger and splint. Whatever little cogency might be attached to this evidence also did not alter the Tribunal’s position.
The Appellant, in correspondence with the Respondent dated 11 June2024, furnished a bundle of documents to show that he had completed 40 hours training in addition to the minimum, mandatory 20 hours training [albeit this was not furnished within the first three months of his existing trainee licence and, thus, was not in compliance with the conditions of that trainee licence].
The Respondent, in their Response dated 9 September 2024, reiterated the above-mentioned reasons for refusing the Appellant’s application for a second trainee licence. In addition, it was confirmed that the Appellant’s existing trainee licence covered the period 11December 2023 to 10 June 2024 and that his existing trainee licence remained valid until the determination of this appeal, thus extending the duration of the Appellant’s existing trainee licence by a further period of over seven months. The Response confirmed that the Appellant had failed, on 27 August 2024, his first attempt to pass a Part 3 test and that had booked a second attempt that was on hold pending a date being provided to him. The Response pointed out that the Appellant, if he wished to obtain further training, could attend a training course, or study or practice with an ADI or give unpaid tuition and pointed out that many ADI applicants obtained registration as a fully-qualified ADI without ever holding a trainee licence.
If the Appellant had been unable to meet the training conditions set out in his existing trainee licence due to the  reasons advanced by the Appellant in his written representations, repeated in his Notice of Appeal, he could have surrendered his existing trainee licence back to the Respondent who then might well, in those circumstances, have looked more favourably on an application for a second trainee licence, as might the Tribunal have done in determining this appeal.
This appeal concerns a decision of the Respondent to refuse the Appellant’s application for a second trainee licence. The powers of the Tribunal in determining this appeal are set out ins.131 of the Road Traffic Act 1988 (‘the Act’). In determining the appeal, the Tribunal may make such order as it thinks fit, standing in the shoes of the Respondent, considering the decision afresh on the evidence available to it, giving appropriate weight to the Respondent’s reasons for their decision. Theburden of proof in satisfying the Tribunal that the Respondent’s decision was wrong rests with theAppellant.
The essential basis of the Respondent’s decision was that the Appellant had been provided under his first trainee licence, more than adequate time to gain sufficient experience to pass his Part 3 test and that he had not complied with the conditions of that licence.
An appeal to this Tribunal against the Respondent’s decision proceeds as an appeal by way ofre-hearing, that is, the Tribunal makes a fresh decision on the evidence before it. The Tribunal must givesuch weight as it considers appropriate to the Respondent’s reasons for its decision as the Respondent is the regulatory authority tasked by Parliament with making such decisions. The Tribunal does not conduct a proceduralreview of the Respondent’s decision-making process.
In reaching my decision I have taken into account all of the written evidence and submissions received by the Tribunal and considered all of the relevant circumstances of this appeal.
There was little or no dispute as to the material facts of this case.
Accordingly, the appeal isdismissed.

Appellant
-and-
REGISTRAR OF APPROVED DRIVING INSTRUCTORS
Respondent
Decision: The appeal is Dismissed. The Decision of the Respondent made  on 28 August 2024 is confirmed.
REASONS
This appeal was listed for determination on the papers only, with the agreement of the parties.
The Appellant appealed against a decision of the Respondent dated 28 August 2024, to refuse the Appellant’s application for a further, third, trainee driving instructor licence made on 22 July 2024. The decision of the Respondent was made, taking account of representations made by the Appellant, in writing, on 18 August 2024, namely, that there was a lack of available dates to undertake a Part 3 test, and other issues that he did not, at that stage, elucidate, leading to lost training time, on the grounds that the Appellant had been granted two trainee licences, covering a period of 12 months in total, from 7 August 2023 to 6 August 2024, to gain sufficient expertise in driving instruction to pass a Part 3 test, a time period that, it was submitted, was more than adequate; that it was not the intention of Parliament that a trainee licence be issued for however long it might take a candidate to become an ADI; that the trainee licence system must not be allowed to become an alternative to registration as a fully-qualified ADI; that refusal of the Appellant’s application did not prevent him undertaking a Part 3 test (subject to there being a maximum permitted number of attempts); that a trainee licence was not required to undertake a Part 3 test and that the Appellant’s existing second trainee licence remained valid until determination of this appeal (as his application for a third trainee licence had been made before the expiry of his second trainee licence), providing him, in practical terms, with a total trainee licence period of almost 18 months.
The Appellant submitted an appeal on 9 September 2024 against the Respondent’s said decision on the following grounds:
that while he understood the Respondent’s reasoning for their decision, several factors had not been adequately considered;
a lack of availability of Part 3 test dates had caused him to lose training time (having failed his first attempt on 16 May 2024) and impacting on his ability to progress within the expected time frame;
that an ‘inability’ to practise in the absence of a further trainee licence would jeopardise his chances of successfully passing another attempt at a Part 3 test for which he was actively preparing, enhancing his teaching skills and theoretic knowledge;
that he would be ‘unable to continue providing lessons’ if he did not get a third trainee licence and that this would affect his ability to maintain his skills and interest and would cause him to lose students, the consequences of which would be ‘devastating’ to his livelihood;
that he should be given a third trainee licence due to the non-availability of Part3 test dates and his commitment to professional growth; being granted two previous trainee licences was not sufficient to enable him to gain the required experience due to the circumstances;
that his situation was unique;
that he needed to be able to continue teaching until he passed his Part3 test ‘on his next attempt’.
The Respondent, in their Response dated 11 November 2024, submitted, in addition, that there was no evidence adduced by the Appellant of lost training time or a lack of pupils; that he had failed his Part 3 test on two occasions (16 May 2024 and 24 October2024); that the Appellant’s final permitted attempt to pass his Part3 test was booked on hold pending a date being offered to him and that, if he wished to gain further experience, he could undertake a training course, or study or practice with an ADI or provide unpaid tuition, pointing out that precedent existed whereby applicants succeeded in becoming registered as fully-qualified ADIs without having held any trainee licence.
Again, the purpose of a trainee licence, that is of six months’ duration, is to allow an ADI applicant the opportunity of gaining practical experience in driving tuition in  order to reach the required standard to pass a Part 3 test and, thereby, become registered as a fully-qualified ADI and it is not necessary to hold a trainee licence in order to undertake a Part 3 test. It must be emphasised that the Appellant in this case had, in practical terms, the benefit of a trainee licence for almost 18 months.
This appeal concerns a decision of the Respondent to refuse the Appellant’s application for a further, third, ADI trainee licence. The powers of the Tribunal in determining this appeal are set out ins.131 of the Road Traffic Act 1988 (‘the Act’). In determining the appeal, the Tribunal may make such order as it thinks fit, standing in the shoes of the Respondent, considering the decision afresh on the evidence available to it, giving appropriate weight to the Respondent’s reasons for their decision. Theburden of proof in satisfying the Tribunal that the Respondent’s decision was wrong rests with theAppellant.
The essential basis of the Respondent’s decision was that the Appellant had been provided, under two trainee licences (albeit, in practical terms, he had the benefit of a trainee licence for almost 18 months) that was more than adequate time to gain sufficient experience to pass his Part 3 test.
An appeal to this Tribunal against the Respondent’s decision proceeds as an appeal by way ofre-hearing, that is, the Tribunal makes a fresh decision on the evidence before it. The Tribunal must givesuch weight as it considers appropriate to the Respondent’s reasons for its decision as the Respondent is the regulatory authority tasked by Parliament with making such decisions. The Tribunal does not conduct a proceduralreview of the Respondent’s decision-making process.
In reaching my decision I have taken into account all of the evidence and submissions received, written and oral, and considered all of the circumstances relevant to this appeal.
There was little or no dispute as to the material facts of this case.
Accordingly, the appeal isdismissed.

and
THE REGISTRAR OF APPROVED DRIVING INSTRUCTORS
Respondent
Representation:
For the Appellant: in person
For the Respondent: Darren Russell, Deputy Registrar
Decision: The appeal is Dismissed.
REASONS
This is an appeal by the Appellant against the decision of the Registrar dated 20 December 2023 not to grant the Appellant a trainee licence as a driving instructor.
Procedural matters
The Tribunal received and considered the Appellant’s Notice of Appeal, the Registrar’s Response and other documents, and the parties attended an oral hearing. No bundle was provided.
The Registrar’s Response refers to, but does not attach, supporting documents. The Tribunal considered whether these omissions were material to the Appeal and decided that, although this was inconvenient, the Appeal could be decided fairly and justly without them, as the relevant points could be seen in other documents or raised in the hearing, or were otherwise not material to the decision.
The Appellant and the Registrar’s representative, Mr Russell, attended the hearing by Cloud Video Platform (“CVP”).  Mr Russell did not make any comments during the hearing and, due to a misunderstanding of the capacity in which he was attending, the Panel did not direct any questions to him.  Shortly after the hearing the Panel spoke with Mr Russell via CVP, and he confirmed that there were no comments which he wished to make and that he was content for the Panel to proceed to make its decision on the basis of what it had heard.
The Tribunal is satisfied that this was a fair and just way to decide the Appeal.
Relevant law
The grant of a trainee licence enables applicants to provide driving instruction for payment before they are qualified.
A trainee licence may be granted in the circumstances set out in s129 of the Road Traffic Act 1988 (“the Act”) and the Motor Cars (Driving Instruction) Regulations 2005.
A licence under s129(1) of the Act is granted: “for the purpose of enabling a person to acquire practical experience in giving instruction in driving motor cars with a view to undergoing such part of the examination [...] as consists of a practical test of ability and fitness to instruct.”
Under s129(2) of the Act, the Registrar must grant a licence to an applicant who fulfils specified conditions. One of these conditions, set out in s125(3)(e), is that the applicant is a fit and proper person to have his name entered in the register of approved driving instructors.  The Act does not specify what this standard requires.
In Harris v The Registrar of Approved Driving Instructors [2010] EWCA Civ 808, Richards LJ said that, when applying this standard:
“a central question is an applicant's fitness to be a driving instructor – that he has the requisite instructional ability and driving ability and that he does not pose a risk in any respect to his pupils or other users of the road. The ""fit and proper person"" condition has obvious relevance to that issue, though the more technical aspects are covered by other, more specific conditions relating to tests, driving licence and the like. But the condition is not simply that the applicant is a fit and proper person to be a driving instructor; it is that he is a fit and proper person to have his name entered in the register. Registration carries with it an official seal of approval: those registered are known as ""Driving Standards Agency Approved Driving Instructors"".
The powers of this Tribunal in relation to appeals against decisions not to grant trainee licences are set out in s131 of the Act. When making a decision on any such appeal, the Tribunal stands in the shoes of the Registrar and takes a fresh decision on the evidence available to it, giving appropriate weight to the Registrar’s decision as the person tasked by Parliament with making such decisions.
Background
The Appellant was convicted on 15 June 2023 of an offence, committed on 15 September 2022, relating to using his mobile phone while driving.  He received six penalty points on his driving licence and a fine of £220.
The Registrar has provided the following chronology of events, which the Appellant has not disputed:
the Appellant was granted two trainee licences valid from 14 March 2022 to 13 March 2023;
in an email dated 4 November 2023 the Appellant was advised that it would be highly unlikely that the Registrar would accept an application from him for a trainee licence or for his name to be entered onto the register, until 15 September 2025;
on 28 November 2023 the Appellant submitted an application for a third trainee licence, in which he declared the above offence;
in a letter dated 5 December 2023 the Registrar advised the Appellant that he was considering refusing the application, and invited the Appellant to make representations regarding this;
the Appellant made representations in an email dated 6 December 2023;
the Registrar wrote to the Appellant by letter dated 20 December 2023, refusing the application.
The Appellant appealed to the Tribunal.
The Appeal
The Appellant submits that:
other applicants in similar situations have been accepted (although he provided no examples or other evidence to support this);
since his offence he has focussed on his studies and completed a law degree;
he is deeply sorry for having committed the offence; and
he has been driving for five to six years, and since the offence has worked in jobs which require regular driving, without incident.
Regrettably, the parties did not provide the Tribunal with copies of correspondence between them regarding the Appellant’s application.  The Registrar’s Response to the Appeal includes what the Registrar says were the Appellant’s representations in relation to the proposed refusal of his application.  In summary, these were:
That his offence was committed in the heat of the moment;
That he recognises the gravity of his actions, that he should have exercised better judgment and that he is sorry.
The Registrar submits that:
anyone who is an approved driving instructor is expected to have higher standards of driving and behaviour than the average motorist;
teaching people to drive is a responsible and demanding task and should be entrusted to those with high standards and a keen regard for road safety;
in committing the offence, the Appellant had not displayed the level of responsibility or commitment to improving road safety that the Registrar would expect of a potential approved driving instructor;
the Government has increased the penalties for certain motoring offences, and that these offences contribute to a significant number of road casualties;
the Registrar cannot condone motoring offences of this nature; and
to allow the Appellant a licence would be unfair to other applicants who had been scrupulous in observing the law, and could undermine the public’s confidence in the system.
Discussion
The Appellant described the circumstances of his offence to the Tribunal. He said that: he had been driving to a supermarket when he noticed an email arrive on his phone; on reading the email he saw that it was a notification from solicitors acting for him, telling him that a property purchase which he was proposing to make had fallen through; he was shocked by this and panicked as it would cause him a significant financial loss; he immediately called his solicitor to discuss it; a police officer saw him driving while doing this, and stopped him while he was driving; this happened when he was around 20 seconds’ driving time away from the supermarket.
The Appellant’s offence was a serious one, meriting six penalty points and a fine.
Moreover, the circumstances of the Appellant’s offence indicate a very serious lack of judgment. Not only was the Appellant making a phone call while driving, but before this he had been looking at the screen of his phone with enough attention to see that an email had arrived from his solicitors.  The email, of which the Tribunal has seen a copy, does not indicate in its subject heading or introductory text that it is urgent or pressing.
The Appellant submits that he has changed since the incident and has learned from it.  The Tribunal accepts this.  The Appellant has held driving-related jobs which would require declarations of other offences and which would be put at risk by sub-standard driving behaviours.
The Registrar’s decision does not mean that the Registrar will never consider the Appellant to be a fit and proper person to become an approved driving instructor. The Registrar has indicated a date in the future after which it will (implicitly) become more likely that he would accept an application from the Appellant for a trainee licence, or to be entered onto the register.
Regarding the Appellant’s unevidenced submission that others in similar circumstances have been accepted, decisions of the Tribunal are made on a case-by-case basis, based on the evidence available to the Tribunal.  Decisions of the First-tier Tribunal are not binding on Tribunals in other cases.  In any event no examples were presented and the Tribunal did not consider this to be relevant to its decision.
Conclusion and decision
Having considered the matters set out above, the Tribunal finds that, while the Appellant has learned from his offence and is developing a successful early career as a driver, the seriousness of the offence and its circumstances outweigh these factors.
The Tribunal is not persuaded that the Registrar’s decision was wrong, and accordingly dismisses the Appeal.

David Rees KC, Deputy High Court Judge
This judgment was delivered in private. The judge has given leave for this version of the judgment to be published on condition that (irrespective of what is contained in the judgment) in any published version of the judgment the anonymity of the child and members of his family must be strictly preserved. All persons, including representatives of the media, must ensure that this condition is strictly complied with. Failure to do so will be a contempt of court.
Mr David Rees KC:
INTRODUCTION
On 31 July 2024 Ms Victoria Butler-Cole KC, sitting as a Deputy Judge of the High Court, handed down judgment and made an order (“the Return Order”) for the summary return of K to the United States of America pursuant to the 1980 Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction (“the 1980 Convention”).   That order has not been carried into effect.  Instead, I have before me two competing cross-applications:
On behalf of the Applicant Mother, an application for further orders to ensure K’s return to the USA; and
On behalf of the Respondent Father, an application to set aside the Return Order pursuant to rule 12.52A of the Family Procedure Rules 2010.
Ms Butler-Cole published her judgment on an anonymised basis as KS v CS [2024] EWHC 2115 (Fam).  I am publishing this judgment on the same basis and for ease of reference I adopt the same anonymisation convention as she did.  That is to say that the Applicant mother is KS, the Respondent father, CS and the Child is K.
None of the counsel before me appeared before Ms Butler-Cole.  Before me, KS is represented by Mr Jonathan Evans of Counsel and the respondent father CS by Geraldine More O’Ferrall of counsel.  K was joined as a party to these proceedings by an order of Ms Barbara Mills KC dated 15 October 2024, and he is represented by Ms Clarissa Wigoder of counsel, instructed by K’s Solicitor Guardian, Ms Laura Coyle.  I am grateful to all counsel for their written and oral submissions in this matter.
I wish at the outset of this judgment to record my apologies to the parties for the significant length of time it has taken me to prepare this judgment.  This has been the consequence of an extended illness on my part. I am grateful for their patience.
BACKGROUND
The background facts are set out in Ms Butler-Cole’s judgment, and I do not propose to repeat them in any great detail. The key points for the purpose of this judgment are as follows:
K was born in 2009 in the USA.  The hearing before Ms Butler-Cole took place shortly before his fifteenth birthday.  At the date of the hearing before me K was around two months beyond his fifteenth birthday.
K’s parents were very young when he was born and were unmarried.  Their relationship ended and both have since married other people.
Until May 2023, K lived with his mother, KS, and her wife in the state of Georgia in the USA.  K’s father, CS lives in the UK with his wife and four other children.
In May 2023 KS and her wife were involved in a serious road traffic accident in the USA which resulted in their being hospitalised.  K was not involved in the accident.
Following the accident, CS flew to the USA and decided to take K back to the UK.  The precise events that led to this decision being taken are contentious.  However, it is common ground that KS did not provide her consent for K to travel to the UK.
There appears to have been an understanding (at least on the part of KS) that K would return to the USA in time for the start of the new school year in August 2023.
However, he did not return, and K has now been living with his father in this jurisdiction since May 2023.
KS issued an application for a summary return under the Hague Convention shortly before the first anniversary of K’s departure from the USA, and the application came before Ms Butler-Cole on 30 July 2024.
At that hearing the father relied on two defences to the application:
That the removal of K from the USA was not “wrongful” under Art. 3 of the 1980 Convention on the basis that at the time of the removal the mother was not exercising rights of custody in relation to K; and
That pursuant to Art. 13(2) of the 1980 Convention, K objected to being returned to the USA and had attained an age and degree of maturity at which it was appropriate to take account of his views.
In the course of the final hearing Ms Butler-Cole heard oral evidence from Ms Demery of CAFCASS who had prepared a report in relation to K and oral submissions on behalf of both parents.  The judge also had the opportunity, before preparing her judgment to have a brief meeting by way of video-link with K.
In her evidence Ms Demery told the judge that K was not refusing to return to the USA.  She described K as not angry or objecting but expressing a preference to remain with his father in England.  Although K had told Ms Demery that he would be ‘depressed’ if he had to go back to the USA, she had not formed the view that he would be very upset if he was required to do so.
Ms Butler-Cole KC handed down her written judgment the following morning.  She dismissed both of the father’s defences:
She concluded that the removal of K from the USA was “wrongful” within the meaning of Art. 3 of the 1980 Convention and that the mother had been exercising rights of custody in relation to K, notwithstanding the fact that she was hospitalised as at the date of removal.
In relation to the Art. 13(2) defence the judge held that K was objecting to a return in 1980 Convention terms.  She explained her decision on this point at paragraph [29] of her judgment:
“I have considered whether K's wishes fall on the side of being a preference or wish, as submitted by Mr Shama, rather than an objection. I have decided that it is appropriate to treat his views as an objection. The dividing line between the two is fuzzy, in my view, and I should therefore err on the side of caution in K's favour. That approach seems to me to afford proper respect to K, who, as a nearly-15-year-old, has thought carefully about his situation and engaged with the court process to make his views known. I suspect that K would be surprised to be told that his politely expressed and reasoned wish to stay in England with his father did not count as an objection to returning to America, and that I had therefore not asked myself whether his views should prevail.”
Notwithstanding this conclusion the judge exercised her discretion to order a return.  The judge held that K was objecting to a return to the USA within the meaning of Art. 13(2) of the 1980 Convention, but exercised her discretion under Art. 13(2) to nonetheless order a return.  The judge set out at paragraph [31] of her judgment the factors that had particularly influenced that decision.  These included the following:
K’s objection to a return.
The judge considered that K had picked up a narrative from his father of negative views in relation to the mother, and that to some degree K’s views were influenced by the father.
The fact that it was not possible to secure a prompt return to the USA meant that “[t]he arguments on both sides are now more finely balanced as a result of the time that has passed, with the objectives of the Convention in particular being less weighty than they would have been at an early stage”  [31 (ii)].
The judge considered that K’s experiences since his mother’s accident had undermined his relationship with his mother and made it more difficult for him to trust her.  The judge held “I doubt that spending short periods of time with his mother by way of visits in school holidays will enable him to carry out the reparative work that Ms Demery says he urgently needs after the past 12 months” [31 (iii)].
In contrast to the negative views that the father held about the mother, and which the judge considered he was passing on to K the judge noted “I am satisfied that KS will support K's relationship with his father while the US courts make welfare determinations, as she has previously supported that relationship (for example by her sending K to England in 2019 to stay with his father) and, significantly, she is now aware of how happy K is to have finally built a strong relationship with his father, and how important that relationship is to him” [31(iii)].
The judge concluded at para [33]:
“I have found that K was wrongfully removed from the USA. He has had a very disrupted year, and while there have been some positives, CS should not have decided unilaterally that K should live in England. In my view, K's relationship with both his parents will be better promoted by his returning to the USA. The courts there can evaluate all the welfare considerations fully and decide what is best. The critical need to maintain and promote K's relationship with both his parents throughout his life, against a backdrop of wrongful removal and in the context of the wider policy objectives of the Convention, leads me to the conclusion that KS' application should succeed. I know that this is not the outcome that K wished for, and there will no doubt be some challenges for him going back to life in America, but in my judgment, these worries do not outweigh the other considerations.”
Following the handing down of her judgment, the judge met with K over a video-link for a second time and explained her decision to him.  The judge recorded K’s reaction in an email which she sent to counsel later that afternoon.  The key passage of that email is as follows:
“[K] was upset and said he did not want to go back to America and would never go back. He said he felt he should have explained himself to me in the meeting yesterday as I hadn't understood his views. I said that I had fully understood that he did not want to back, but that the legal framework meant that his wishes were not automatically the answer about what should happen.
“He was very upset and said he would refuse to go, and that he was very happy to be living with his father and did not want to go and live with his mother and 'her wife'. He wanted a male role model, and he realised now that his mother had lied to him about his father being a 'deadbeat’ who wasn't interested in him. He was upset that I had not listened to what he wanted. He said he had wanted to live with his father for 10 years and he repeated some of the things in Ms Demery's report for example about his mother taking all his clothes away when he said he wanted to live with his dad.”
Notwithstanding K’s immediate reaction to her decision, the judge nonetheless made the Return Order.  This required K’s return to the USA by 11.59pm on 14 August 2024 and directed the parties to co-operate in obtaining emergency travel documents for K.  That order has not been carried into effect.
EVENTS SINCE 31 JULY 2024
The father has provided a statement in which he describes that, following the judge’s decision, K was “distraught and difficult to console”, telling the father that he would not return to the USA.  Although the father made arrangements to attend the mother’s solicitors’ offices on 8 August 2024 to collect K’s expired travel documents and to attend the US Embassy on the same day with K to obtain new travel documents, the father’s case is that K refused to cooperate with this process.  K refused on a number of occasions to have a passport photograph taken and on 8 August, refused to get out of bed to travel to London (I am told that the father’s arrangements would have required a 4.00am start).  The appointment was rebooked for 27 August and the father’s case is that K again refused to attend.  The father’s evidence is that he and his wife had sought to reassure K about a return and impress upon him the importance of following the court’s order.
In the meantime, on 13 August 2024 the father’s solicitors had written to the court informing it that K had refused to attend the US Embassy and asking for the matter to be restored before Ms Butler-Cole.  She was not available, and the matter was listed for hearing before another judge, Ms Nicola Davey, on 8 October 2024.  Shortly prior to that hearing, on 7 October 2024 the mother applied for an order enforcing the return order.  On 8 October the father applied for, and was granted, a 7-day adjournment to issue a set aside application.  The same day K contacted Ms Coyle of Freemans Solicitors for assistance in putting his views before the court.
The father’s set aside application was issued on 10 October and on 14 October a C2 application was issued by Ms Coyle on behalf of K seeking his joinder as a party and further directions.  Further directions were given by Ms Barbara Mills KC on 15 October and the matter came before me for hearing on 12 November.  Shortly before that hearing the father disclosed a set of text messages between the father and K from 2022 which I gave the mother permission to rely upon.
SETTING ASIDE – THE LAW
The Court has power to set aside a return order where no error of the court is alleged.  The procedure for such an application is governed by FPR r12.52A and supplemented by PD12F para 4.1A which explains:
“In rare circumstances, the court might also “set aside” its own order where it has not made an error but where new information comes to light which fundamentally changes the basis on which the order was made.  The threshold for the court to set aside its decision is high, and evidence will be required – not just assertions or allegations.
“If the return order or non-return order was made under the 1980 Hague Convention, the court might set aside its decision where there has been fraud, material non-disclosure or mistake (which all essentially mean that there was information that the court needed to know in order to make its decision, but was not told), or where there has been a fundamental change in circumstances which undermines the basis on which the order was made. If you have evidence of such circumstances and wish to apply to the court to set aside its decision, you should use the procedure in Part 18 of the Rules.”
It is common ground among the parties that the approach that the court should take to a set aside application is that laid down in the judgment of Moylan LJ in Re B (A Child: Abduction) [2020] EWCA Civ 1057 at [86] to [90].  There the judge identified four stages to the court’s consideration of the application:
The court will first decide whether to permit any reconsideration;
If it does, it will decide on the extent of any further evidence;
The court will next decide whether to set aside the existing order;
If the order is set aside, the court will redetermine the substantive application.
Moylan LJ indicated that whilst it may be possible for all four stages to be addressed at one hearing, more typically there would be a preliminary hearing at which the court determines issues (a) and (b) followed by a further hearing at which it determines issues (c) and (d).
At [91] Moylan LJ noted:
“I would further emphasise that, because of the high threshold, the number of cases which merit any application to set aside are likely to be few in number. The court will clearly be astute to prevent what, in essence, are attempts to reargue a case which has already been determined or attempts to frustrate the court’s previous determination by taking steps designed to support or create an alleged change of circumstances.”
Ms Wigoder on behalf of K also took me to the decision of Mr Dexter Dias QC (as he then was) in ST v QR [2022] EWHC 2133 (Fam).  In that case at paragraphs [22] and [23] the judge held:
“[22]. Stepping back, the court is asked to reverse what it has previously decided. It is not because what was decided was legally or procedurally wrong. Equally, this is not judicial review-type scrutiny. The available power is triggered by one thing: the facts have changed. But not every factual change is sufficient. It must be fundamental. I will come to what I understand that to mean shortly, but it involves in itself a finding of fact. The reason is that it is preferrable as a matter of principle for the court which made the original findings of fact, and which determined the return order, to decide itself if the facts have changed sufficiently to require a reassessment of its own substantive decision. In Re W at para.66 Moylan LJ characterised the test as:
""A fundamental change of circumstances which undermines the basis on which the original order was made.""
“[23] I judge that ten implications flow from this formulation:
'A fundamental change of circumstances' should not be elevated into something akin to a statutory test;
It simply asks the judge to assess whether the basis of her or his decision has so radically change that the decision cannot stand. The term ""fundamental"" should be understood in that light;
It is more akin to foundational failure. In other words, the foundation for the decision has been swept away;
It is not necessary at this step, step (c), third out of the four-point rubric, for the applicant to prove on the balance of probabilities that an Article 13(b) exception or indeed any other exception exists;
That cannot be so, or step (d) would be rendered redundant. (See Re A at para.46.)
Thus, the question I ask myself is: does the totality of evidence, old and new, that is existing at the time of the original return order and thereafter, indicate that the foundations for that order either no longer exist or are insufficiently secure to continue to support it;
This is a finding of fact;
The applicant must prove it on a balance of probabilities. That is because of the basic principle that she or he who asserts must prove;
If proved, the court must go on to redetermine the substantive application;
The court may make the same or a different decision.”
PRELIMINARIES – STAGES (A) AND (B)
The set aside application initially came before Ms Barbara Mills KC on 15 October 2024.  On that occasion the judge gave directions, joining K as a party to the proceedings and providing for the filing of further evidence.  However, she did not on that occasion seek to undertake any of the steps identified by Moylan LJ in Re B, and her order provided that at the next hearing (that is to say the hearing that took place before me), the court would consider the father’s set aside application by reference to all four of the Re B stages.
That said, it was common ground before me that the order of 15 October 2024 has led to the filing of additional evidence focussed on the set aside application and to the production by all parties of detailed position statements addressing this issue.  All counsel therefore took the view that although I formally need to consider all four steps identified by Moylan LJ in Re B, the reality of the position is that I should in practical terms focus on stages (c) and (d).  I agree.  The evidence that has been lodged by all parties, and in particular the position now articulated on behalf of K by his Solicitor Guardian, means that I am satisfied that there are good reasons why I should permit a reconsideration in this case.  I am also satisfied that the evidence that has been filed in accordance with the order of Ms Mills means that no further evidence is required, and I am in a position to proceed forthwith to Moylan LJ’s stages (c) and (d).
STAGE (C) – SHOULD THE EXISTING ORDER BE SET ASIDE?
In the course of their submissions the parties referred me to a number of cases where the power to set aside a return order had been considered by the court.  I approach these decisions with some caution, because each case is very fact specific.  Even in superficially similar cases, the factors which caused the court to decide to set aside (or as the case may be, not set aside) a return order may on closer examination prove to be quite different.
On behalf of the father, Ms More O’Ferrall and Ms Wigoder both referred me to the decision of Theis J in C v M & Anor (No1 Hague Abduction Application for Re-hearing) [2023] EWHC 1482 (Fam) a decision in which the judge set aside an order requiring the return of two children aged 12 and 5 to Mauritius.  In her original decision the judge had found that the children objected to a return but nonetheless exercised her discretion under Art. 13(2) to order one.  In setting-aside her original order, the judge held that the objections and information provided to the court at the later hearing demonstrated that they were “of a different quality and nature” than the court had considered at the previous hearing.  Following the setting-aside of her original order, the judge reheard the case and declined to order a return.  That decision was subsequently upheld by the Court of Appeal (see C v M (A Child)(Abduction: Representation of Child Party) [2023] EWCA Civ 1449).
By contrast in ST v QR (supra) the judge refused to set aside an order requiring a return of a child to South Africa.  The respondent mother had unsuccessfully relied on Art. 13(b) as a defence to a return order.  An application was made to set aside this order based upon what was said to amount to a change in her medical health and psychological position.  This was rejected by the judge who did not consider that the mother had demonstrated a fundamental change in circumstances and who described the application as “a carefully veiled exercise in trying to reopen and reargue this case”.
For the mother, Mr Evans took me to the decision of Sir Andrew McFarlane P in  A & B (Separate Representation) [2024] EWHC 2834 (Fam).  That was a case where the court was being asked to set aside a return order to the USA based on what was said to be fresh evidence about the strength of the children’s objections to a return.  At paragraph [28.a] the President emphasised that the court should be astute to prevent attempts to reargue an issue that had already been determined and rejected.  He rejected an argument that because the children had not been separately represented at the earlier hearing they could not be said to be “re-arguing” a point taken by their mother at the earlier hearing holding:
“If the case now to be put by the children was previously argued by another party or parties and determined by the court, the court should prevent it being re-argued through a set aside application. The focus must be on the need for a fundamental change that undermines the court’s decision”.
The President described the strength of the children’s objections as having been a “known known” at the earlier hearing and held that the fact that they were still firmly of that view some five months later did not undermine the basis of the court’s previous decision to order a return.
I note that these were all cases where the judge hearing the set aside application was the original judge who made the return order, and clearly it is desirable that wherever  possible, applications to set aside a return order should be listed before the original judge.  I recognise that where, as here, a different judge is hearing the set aside application, particular care is required and that there will need to be clear evidence that the basis upon which the original judge made the order has been undermined by a fundamental change in circumstances.
Turning then to the position in the current case.  Although Ms Butler-Cole made a specific finding that K was objecting to a return to the USA, it does not appear from the judgment that the judge considered K’s objection to be one of any great strength.  Ms Demery’s report characterised K’s wish to remain in the UK as a “strong preference” rather than an objection, and whilst the judge treated K as formally objecting to a return in Convention terms, it seems clear from her description at [29] of the line between a preference and objection as being “fuzzy” and her decision to “err on the side of caution” when treating K’s position as an objection, that she did not consider his  objection to be a deeply rooted or adamantly held one.  This is also apparent from the judge’s summary of Ms Demery’s evidence at [27] and [28] when she stated that K was not saying that he refused to return to the USA and that she (Ms Demery) did not think that he would be very upset to return.  I conclude from the judgment that Ms Butler-Cole recognised that K was objecting to a return to the USA, but that she did not consider this objection to be an adamant one and she did not consider him to be saying that he would refuse to return to the USA.
By contrast, the evidential position before me today is significantly different.
Ms Coyle (who is a highly experienced solicitor in this area of law and has appeared on behalf of represented children in a number of reported cases) has filed two statements on K’s behalf.  In her second, and more comprehensive, statement she describes K as having been able “to show emotional maturity, including the ability to reflect upon information when this has been discussed with him and to put forward his views as to how he wishes his position to be advanced at Court”.  Ms Coyle identifies a number of matters as presenting a fundamentally different factual matrix to that presented to Ms Butler-Cole in July.
She identifies that K has, now through his actions, made it clear that he will not return to the USA.  In this regard Ms Coyle is referring to K’s actions since being informed by Ms Butler-Cole of her decision.  I take these as including:
His immediate reaction to the judge’s decision;
His refusal to co-operate in obtaining a passport photograph;
His refusal to attend the US embassy to renew his travel documents.
His conversations with both parents subsequent to Ms Butler-Cole’s decision to order his return;
His instruction of Ms Coyle;
His consistent and clear indication since the date of that decision that he does not wish to return to the USA;
His stated position that he not only objects to a return, but that he will not return.  Ms Coyle reports K as stating that “he will not go to the airport, and he will not board a plane”.
Ms Coyle also refers to K being aware “of the consequences of his current actions” and that he has told her that he is concerned about what could happen if the police get involved “but that does not change his views and his position that he does not wish to return to the USA”.
Ms Coyle records that K considers that Ms Demery failed to articulate the strength of his views to the Ms Butler-Cole.  K also takes issue with Ms Demery’s assessment of his comment that he would be “depressed” by a return meant that “he would be a bit fed up”.  K considers that the impact of the Return Order goes way beyond that, and K has told Ms Coyle that what he reported to Ms Demery was that if he was required to return to the USA, he would experience a depressive episode.  K has been able to voice concerns to Ms Coyle about his mental health, and I note that he has been seeing a counsellor through his school about anxiety since before the return order was made.  I am, unsurprisingly, told that the current situation is causing him further anxiety.
K’s consistent and adamant opposition to the Return Order also appears to have been reflected in his conversations with both of his parents.  In her recent witness statement KS accepts that K wants to remain living in England with his father (although she does not accept that the objection has changed or the reason for the objection has changed).  K has told Ms Coyle that he is frustrated that KS is ignoring him and dismissing the strength of his feelings.
KS’s position is that K has been empowered by what she describes as CS’ “lacklustre compliance with the return order” to believe that he can ignore the court’s order and override the court’s will.  She is critical of the steps taken by the father to comply with the court’s order and to encourage K to accept the court’s decision and co-operate with the return, describing him as having “gone through the motions doing the bare minimum which would have been abundantly clear to K”.  I do not consider this to be a fair criticism of the father, whose own witness statement sets out the steps he has taken to comply with the order (including booking two appointments at the US embassy for K, taking him to have a passport photograph taken, encouraging K to accept the court’s decision, and speaking to K’s school to ask for their support for K’s return).  It seems to me that given the apparent strength of K’s opposition to the order, the father has been placed in a difficult position between his own obligations to abide by the terms of the order and the need to provide a supportive home environment for K.  Even if the father could have done more to encourage K to co-operate with the taking of his photograph and to attend the embassy, given the evidence before me as to the strength of K’s objection, I do not consider that it would have led to any different outcome.
As the authorities that I have already referred to establish, it is not enough that there is a change in the factual matrix from the date of the original decision.   What is required is that there is a fundamental change of circumstances which undermines the basis on which the original order was made.
Ms More O’Ferrall and Ms Wigoder both argue that there has been a fundamental change in the factual position since Ms Butler-Cole’s decision.  The judge’s decision to order a return rested on Ms Demery’s evidence that K was only expressing a preference to remain in the UK and that he would not be very upset to be returned.  Although the judge treated K as objecting, she was not aware of the depth of his opposition, and that opposition has hardened further since the Return Order was made.  They argue that the court now has a very different evidential picture based on consistent and adamant opposition from K to a return.
For the mother, Mr Evans argues that K’s opposition to a return was a “known known” (to adopt the language of the President in Re A&B  (supra), and that although K has consistently stuck to that position since the return order was made, there has been nothing new which fundamentally alters the position.
I have considered the evidence and the submissions of all parties and have concluded that there has been a fundamental change in circumstances since Ms Butler-Cole’s decision in July 2024 which undermines the basis set out in her judgment for making the Return Order.  Having careful regard to what the judge records in her judgment, I am satisfied that her assessment of the nature and strength of K’s objection was based on what she was told by Ms Demery, both in her report and in her oral evidence – that K was not saying that he would not return to the USA but was instead “expressing a preference” (my emphasis) to remain in the UK.  This is in my view reinforced by Ms Demery’s further evidence, referred to by the judge at [28] that he would be “a bit fed up” if a return was ordered.  Although the judge ultimately decided to categorise K’s position for the purposes of the 1980 Convention as an objection, rather than a preference, it is clear that she did so to afford proper respect to K’s views, rather than because she took a significantly different view of the nature and vehemence of his views to Ms Demery.
That is not now the position.  Since Ms Butler-Cole announced her decision, K has consistently made it quite clear, through both his words and actions, that he is strongly opposed to a return to the USA.   K’s position, articulated through Ms Coyle, is that Ms Demery (and hence the judge) misunderstood the strength of his views.  It seems to me to be likely that events since the decision were announced (such as the arguments that K has had with his mother, and the reality of attempts being made to obtain a passport for him) have also served to strengthen K’s opposition.  Overall, I am satisfied that the nature and quality of the opposition now being articulated by K to a return is of a fundamentally different nature and quality to the evidential picture that was presented to Ms Butler-Cole  in July.  I do not consider that this is simply an attempt to reargue the same position that existed before the judge on that occasion.
Nor do I consider that it is possible to dismiss K’s opposition to a return, as Mr Evans sought to do, as a “known known”.  I note that at paragraph [30] in Re A&B, it was the strength of the opposition to a return, and not merely the existence of opposition per se that the President referred to as a “known known”.   I am entirely satisfied that the factual matrix surrounding the nature of K’s opposition and its strength has fundamentally changed since the judge announced her original decision to return K to the USA.  Whilst the bare fact that K did not want to return was known to Ms Butler-Cole, the strength and consistency of his opposition, and the fact that he is expressly saying that he will refuse to return, was not.
Mr Evans made a further argument which I need to address.  He suggested that even if there had been a fundamental change in the factual position since the delivery by the judge of her judgment, there had not been any fundamental change since the making of the Return Order, because as at the date that the Return Order was sealed (2024-August-6) the judge was aware of the true extent of K’s objection, following her video-call with him on 31 July 2024 when she explained the outcome of the hearing to him.
I do not accept this.  Mr Evans’ argument, that I should look at whether there has been a fundamental change in circumstances since the date that the order was sealed rather than the date of judgment, appears to me to be wholly technical and artificial.  It is, inevitably, to the judgment (which the judge had already handed down before her video-call with K) to which I must look to understand the basis and reasons for her decision.
Although the judge had an opportunity to observe K’s reaction to her decision in her subsequent video call with him, it seems to me that there are obvious reasons why this did not prompt a reconsideration of her decision before the sealing of her order.  First, this video call, like all meetings between a child and a judge, was not for the purpose of gathering evidence.  The Court of Appeal has recently emphasised that the fact that a child objection’s defence has been raised in Hague proceedings should not lead to a meetings between a child and judge assuming a different or greater significance than it would in domestic proceedings in respect of children (Re P (A Child)(Abduction: Child’s Objections) [2024] EWCA Civ 1569 at [75]).  Second, all that the judge had the opportunity to observe during her call with K was his immediate response to her communication to him of her decision.  In the short video call that the judge had with K, there was no opportunity for him to take stock and reflect on her decision.  As such the judge could not have known whether the attitude displayed by K during that call would be sustained or whether his expressed opposition to the decision would fade away once he had had an opportunity to receive support and become used to the outcome.
For the reasons set out above, I am satisfied that there has been a fundamental change in circumstances which undermines the basis on which the return order of 31 July 2024 was made and I accordingly set aside that order.
STAGE (D) – RECONSIDERATION
Having decided that there has been a fundamental change of circumstances which undermines the basis on which the original order was made, it falls to me make the decision afresh.  All counsel considered that I could do so summarily on the basis of the evidence before me (which consists of both the evidence before Ms Butler-Cole KC and the additional evidence that has been filed since) rather than holding a fresh hearing.  I agree.
It is now common ground that the removal of K from the USA by the father was wrongful in 1980 Convention terms and in breach of the mother’s rights of custody.  It is also not disputed that, as at the date of removal, K was habitually resident in the state of Georgia.
On behalf of the father, Ms More O’Ferrall relies upon two defences under the 1980 Convention namely:
Art. 13(2) – that K objects to being returned and has obtained an age and degree of maturity at which it is appropriate to take account of his views.
Art. 13(b) – that there is a grave risk that K’s return would expose him to physical or psychological harm or otherwise place him in an intolerable situation.
On behalf of K Ms Wigoder stands aligned with Ms More O’Ferrall on these two defences and raises a third:
Art. 20 – that a return would not be permitted by the fundamental principles of England and Wales relating to the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms.
ART. 13(2) - THE LAW
Counsel are agreed on the law that applies to the Art 13(2) defence.  On behalf of the mother Mr Evans referred me to the following summary from decision of Williams J in Re Q & V (1980 Hague Convention and Inherent Jurisdiction Summary Return) [2019] EWHC 490 (Fam) at [50]:
“The law on the 'child's objection' defence under Article 13 of the Convention is comprehensively set out in the judgment of Black LJ in Re M (Republic of Ireland)(Child's Objections)(Joinder of Children as Parties to Appeal) [2015] EWCA Civ 26 (and endorsed by the Court of Appeal in Re F (Child's Objections) [2015] EWCA Civ 1022). In summary, the position is as follows:
The gateway stage should be confined to a straightforward and fairly robust examination of whether the simple terms of the Convention are satisfied in that the child objects to being returned and has attained an age and degree of maturity at which it is appropriate to take account of his or her views.
Whether a child objects is a question of fact. The child's views have to amount to an objection before Article 13 will be satisfied. An objection in this context is to be contrasted with a preference or wish.
The objections of the child are not determinative of the outcome but rather give rise to a discretion. Once that discretion arises, the discretion is at large. The child's views are one factor to take into account at the discretion stage.
There is a relatively low threshold requirement in relation to the objections defence, the obligation on the court is to 'take account' of the child's views, nothing more.
At the discretion stage there is no exhaustive list of factors to be considered. The court should have regard to welfare considerations, in so far as it is possible to take a view about them on the limited evidence available. The court must give weight to Convention considerations and at all times bear in mind that the Convention only works if, in general, children who have been wrongfully retained or removed from their country of habitual residence are returned, and returned promptly.
Once the discretion comes into play, the court may have to consider the nature and strength of the child's objections, the extent to which they are authentically the child's own or the product of the influence of the abducting parent, the extent to which they coincide or at odds with other considerations which are relevant to the child's welfare, as well as the general Convention considerations (Re M [2007] 1 AC 619).”
Mr Evans also reminds me of a number of further dicta from the decision of Black LJ in Re M (Republic of Ireland)(Child's Objections)(Joinder of Children as Parties to Appeal) [2015] EWCA Civ 26, reinforcing the point that an objection by a child is not determinative of the issue and that hearing a child is not to be confused with giving effect to his views (Re M at [46]).
Mr Evans and Ms Wigoder both referred me to different passages from para [46] of the speech of Baroness Hale in Re D (A Child) [2007] 1 AC 619.   The full passage reads as follows:
“As any parent who has ever asked a child what he wants for tea knows, there is a large difference between taking account of a child's views and doing what he wants. Especially in Hague Convention cases, the relevance of the child's views to the issues in the case may be limited. But there is now a growing understanding of the importance of listening to the children involved in children's cases. It is the child, more than anyone else, who will have to live with what the court decides. Those who do listen to children understand that they often have a point of view which is quite distinct from that of the person looking after them. They are quite capable of being moral actors in their own right. Just as the adults may have to do what the court decides whether they like it or not, so may the child. But that is no more a reason for failing to hear what the child has to say than it is for refusing to hear the parents' views.”
Ms Wigoder also referred me to the later comment of Baroness Hale in Re M (Children) (Abduction: Rights of Custody) [2008] 1 AC 1288 that:
“[t]he older the child, the greater the weight that her objections are likely to carry.  But that is far from saying that the child’s objections should only prevail in the most exceptional circumstances.”
She also drew my attention to the following extract from the Perez-Vera Explanatory Report to the 1980 Convention at paragraph [30]:
“In addition, the Convention also provides that the child's views concerning the essential question of its return or retention may be conclusive, provided it has, according to the competent authorities, attained an age and degree of maturity sufficient for its views to be taken into account. In this way, the Convention gives children the possibility of interpreting their own interests. Of course, this provision could prove dangerous if it were applied by means of the direct questioning of young people who may admittedly have a clear grasp of the situation but who may also suffer serious psychological harm if they think they are being forced to choose between two parents. However, such a provision is absolutely necessary given the fact that the Convention applies, ratione personae, to all children under the age of sixteen; the fact must be acknowledged that it would be very difficult to accept that a child of, for example, fifteen years of age, should be returned against its will…”
Finally, Ms Wigoder referred me, by way of analogy, to the decision of Mostyn J in SP v EB &KP [2014] EWHC 3694, which she argued was relevant, not just to her Art 13(2) defence but also to the other defences that she and Ms More O’Ferrall were raising.  That case concerned an application for the return of an older teenager, Kate, (aged 14 and 3 months) to Malta.  The hearing before Mostyn J was a rehearing, an appeal against a previous return order made by Parker J having been allowed by the Court of Appeal.  By the time of the hearing before Mostyn J, Kate had been living in England for 18 months and was “well and truly settled” here.  Mostyn J considered that length of time that Kate had spent in England fell to be taken into account under Art 13(2), Art 13(b) and Art 20.  At paras [19] to [21] the judge held:
“[21] The fact that over a year of the 18-month period that Kate has been here is referable to the time it took to appeal and retry the original decision of Parker J is in my judgment neither here nor there. It cannot be gainsaid that in that period, on the ground and in the real world, Kate has become very strongly established here.
[20]  I deal first with the Article 13(2) defence. …  Obviously, as the words of Article 13(2) require, Kate must be of a sufficient age and maturity to voice an objection that is capable of being taken into account. … Beyond that she must express, as I stated in B v B [2014] EWHC 1804 (Fam), “a sound, reasoned and mature objection to being returned to her homeland for the sole limited purpose of enabling the court of that country to determine her long-term future.” … This is not a case where the father has pursued his welfare case so that we can foresee a conclusive determination within a few weeks or months after her return to Malta. It has yet even to be started. It could be many months, perhaps over a year, before a final resolution. In such circumstances Kate is well justified, in my judgment, in objecting to a return for what may be a prolonged period where her whole present life including, most importantly, her education would be turned upside down.”
[21]  For the same reasons I consider that the defence under Article 13(b) is made out. Normally a return for a short finite period to enable a welfare decision to be reached would not give rise to a grave risk of harm or intolerability. But where a child has established a whole new life over a prolonged period in the away state, including the adoption of an educational path in which she is prospering, it is likely to be intolerable and seriously harmful for a return to be ordered where the welfare proceedings that would ultimately decide her future have not even been commenced. …
[22] And for the same reasons I consider that a return would violate Kate's right to family life under Article [8] of the ECHR 1950 (and Article 7 of the CFREU 2000), and that therefore a defence under Article 20 is established also. Kate's family life extends to her direct family, her new home, her society of friends and her education. All this would be considerably disturbed by a return for a prolonged period, as Mr Power's report and his oral testimony so vividly prove. Certainly the non-return of Kate violates, or potentially violates, the father's equivalent right to an aspect of family life namely the society of his daughter, but it is well established that if the same family rights of a parent and child are in competition the child's rights will prevail (see Yousef v The Netherlands [2003] 1 FLR 210). I agree with Mr Jarman that an Article 20 defence can only be established exceptionally as routine use of it would risk undermining the core purposes of the Convention in general and the scope of Article 11.6-11.8 of B2R in particular. However, the combination of the prolonged delay coupled with the father's total inaction in the same period take this case over the threshold of exceptionality, in my judgment.”
ART 13(2) - DISCUSSION
All counsel are agreed that the threshold for the Art 13(2) defence is met in this case, that is to say that K is objecting to a return to the USA and has attained an age and degree of maturity at which it is appropriate to account of his views and that accordingly the discretion is at large. I agree.  I therefore turn to consider factors relevant to the exercise of that discretion.
K’s views are obviously an important part of the matrix.  Given his age, his views carry weight in the exercise of my discretion, although I recognise that they should not be determinative of the outcome.   I take account, as Ms Butler-Cole did, that K’s initial wish to stay in England may have been influenced by a negative narrative about his mother derived from his father.  In support of this Mr Evans drew my attention to a number of recently disclosed messages between K and his father from 2022 which Mr Evans says shows that the father was unduly influencing K.  However, I consider that Ms Coyle’s evidence shows that K is capable of showing emotional maturity and an ability to reflect upon information when this is discussed with him.  He has told Ms Coyle that he was frustrated that he did not get to have a closer relationship with his father when growing up, and Ms Coyle records that K is able to review the relationships with the important people in his life individually and his wish to have a closer relationship with his father does not change his relationship with his mother.
Even if the father has in the past provided K with a negative narrative about his mother, I do not consider that this influence is now the driving force behind K’s opposition to a return.  Ms Coyle is clear that from her discussions with K his current frustration with his mother is focussed on these proceedings, which are against his wishes.
Like Ms Butler-Cole I accept that K’s wish to remain in England is an authentic one.  He has articulated a set of reasons to both Ms Demery and to Ms Coyle underpinning this desire and in my judgment those reasons are mature, clear, consistent and rational.  He wishes to remain with his father in England.  He has established a close relationship with his father, his stepmother and siblings.  He is settled in his school in England which he enjoys, and he is doing well there.  He has begun his GCSE courses.  K has told Ms Coyle that if he returned to the USA, it would be to a different school to the one that he previously attended as he would have progressed from middle school to high school.  On the other hand he has accepted that there are things that he misses about the USA.  I am satisfied that K’s wish to remain in England is deeply held and is one that is based upon a considered reflection of the advantages and disadvantages, as he sees them, of a return.
In exercising my discretion I must also take into account the 1980 Convention and its purpose, and I bear in mind that the 1980 Convention only works, if in general, children who have been wrongfully retained or removed from their country of habitual residence are returned and returned promptly (see Black LJ in Re M (supra) at [71]), and I take into account that this was a wrongful removal by the father.  A central foundation of the 1980 Convention is that where a child has been unilaterally removed from the country of their habitual residence in breach of someone’s rights of custody, then they should be swiftly returned to that country for the courts of that country to decide on their long-term future (B v B [2014] EWHC 1804 (Fam) per Mostyn J at [2]).
However, as Ms Butler-Cole identified in her judgment at [31(ii)] this is a case where K has been in this jurisdiction for a considerable period of time (almost 18 months to the date of the hearing before me) and a “prompt” return to the USA is no longer possible and, like her, I consider that as a consequence the objectives of the Convention carry less weight than they might have done at an early stage.  Moreover, I note also that there are no proceedings relating to K currently on foot in Georgia, and that were I to order a return (notwithstanding his clear opposition) this is not a case where the dispute between his parents would be quickly settled by the courts of that state.
Independently of his wishes, the length of time that K has been in England and the degree of settlement that he has clearly obtained in that time are further factors that I must also take into account.  As at the date of the hearing before me, he had been in England for around 18 months.  It is clear that during this time he has integrated well into his new family life with a stepmother and siblings.  He is plainly thriving at school and has built up a network of friends here.  As such I find that as at the date of the hearing before me K is strongly established here.
Of particular weight in Ms Butler-Cole’s decision to order K’s return to the USA was the concern that not to do so would damage his relationship with his mother.  Ms Demery told the judge that K’s experiences since the mother’s car accident had undermined the relationship between them and made it more difficult for him to trust her.  The judge held (para [31(iii)]) that spending short periods of time with KS during school holidays would not be sufficient to enable them to carry out the reparative work needed.  The judge also considered that there was a real risk that if K remained in this jurisdiction the father would not support him to renew his relationship with his mother; by contrast she was satisfied that if a return to the USA was ordered, the mother would support K’s continued relationship with the father.
I can see precisely why the judge reached this conclusion on the evidence that was before her.  However, the factual position as it exists before me is a different one, and it seems to me that the Return Order itself now stands as a substantial obstacle to the renewal of the relationship between K and his mother.  K, himself, is clear that it is the source of his  frustration with his mother and I agree with Ms Coyle’s comment that forcing K “to return against his will is unlikely to lead to a positive outcome when he is clear this is not what he wishes to happen”.
I am satisfied from Ms Coyle’s evidence that K does not consider that he is currently being listened to by his mother and that communication between them has proved particularly difficult since the Return Order was made.  The father’s evidence describes telephone conversations between K and his mother in August 2024 which became argumentative and led to K becoming upset.  K himself has told Ms Coyle “that he currently does not feel as if his wishes and feelings have been treated with respect by his mother and, at times, he has felt that there have been unfair words and comments made by his mother and also [her wife] which have upset him.” However, I am pleased to note that K is alive to the importance of building his relationships with both of his parents.  He misses aspects of his life in the USA and, if permitted to remain here, he wishes to have contact with and spend time in the USA with his mother and her wife.  He has told Ms Coyle that he would be open to mediation and having an opportunity to speak directly to his mother about the way he is feeling with a professional present able to support him.  In his recent statement CS has also confirmed that he and his wife have encouraged and supported K to have contact with his mother, and I consider that it is likely that if K remains here, the father will respect this commitment.
I am also satisfied that these proceedings have had a very significant impact on K.  He is receiving counselling through school for anxiety, and he has voiced his concerns for his mental health to Ms Coyle; making clear that the impact upon him of the return order was “way beyond being ‘a bit fed up’” as initially reported by Ms Demery.
Taking all these matters into account and bearing in mind that I am making the decision afresh on the basis of a different evidential picture, I have reached a different conclusion to Ms Butler-Cole, and I exercise my discretion to refuse a summary return under the Convention.  I am satisfied that on the evidence before me that K’s welfare needs align with his desire to remain in this jurisdiction.
That is not to say that I disagree with Ms Butler-Cole on the need for K to be supported to renew and repair his relationship with his mother.  I consider this to be extremely important and I fully expect CS to make good on his assurances to encourage and support K in this regard.  However, in the light of K’s adamant opposition to a return, the stability that his life here has achieved, and the other factors weighing against a return, on balance I have concluded that I should exercise my discretion and decline to order his return to the USA.
ART 13(b) - INTOLERABILITY
Again, the law in relation to this defence is not disputed between counsel.  Ms Wigoder referred me to the speech of Lady Hale in Re D [2006] 1 AC 619 at [52]:
“‘Intolerable’ is a strong word, but when applied to a child must mean ‘a situation which this particular child in these particular circumstances should not be expected to tolerate’. It is, as article 13(b) makes clear, the return to the requesting state, rather than the enforced removal from the requested state, which must have this effect… No one intended that an instrument designed to secure the protection of children from the harmful effects of international abduction should itself be turned into an instrument of harm.”
In support of this ground Ms More O’Ferrall and Miss Wigoder point to the factors that I have already outlined at paragraph [54] above and to the concerns that K himself has raised as to the effect that a forced return to the USA would have upon his mental health.  Ms Wigoder also identifies that if a return is ordered, there is no timescale for the resolution of any welfare proceedings before the Georgia courts.  She argues that a return to Georgia in those circumstances is something that K would find intolerable, and this cannot be alleviated by the protective measures offered by the mother.  By way of analogy, she points me to the decision of Mostyn J in SP v EB & KP and invites me to reach a similar conclusion.
Mr Evans makes the point that if a return is ordered, K will be returning to the life that he enjoyed prior to his wrongful removal.  Until that removal, the mother had always been K’s primary carer.  He will be returning to a home and a life that will be familiar to him, and that cannot be considered to be intolerable.  Mr Evans accepts that K would be attending a new school, as he will have transitioned from middle school to high school, but observes that he will be with the same cohort of contemporaries that he was before his removal.
Taking into account the adamant opposition now being articulated by K to a return, the concerns that he has raised about the effect of a return to his mental health and the stability of the life that he has built in the period of time that he has been in England (18 months as at the date of the hearing before me), I am satisfied that to order a summary return under the Convention would place him in a situation which he should not be expected to tolerate.  Whilst I recognise that there is force in Mr Evans’ argument that K would be returning to a life with which he is familiar, I agree with Mostyn J’s conclusion at [21] in SP v EB & KP  that:
“But where a child has established a whole new life over a prolonged period in the away state, including the adoption of an educational path in which she is prospering, it is likely to be intolerable and seriously harmful for a return to be ordered where the welfare proceedings that would ultimately decide her future have not even been commenced.”
Accordingly, I would also refuse a return under Art 13(b).
ART. 20
Finally, Ms Wigoder argues that K’s right to a family life under Art. 8 ECHR means that a defence is also established under Art. 20 of the 1980 Convention as well.  I am not persuaded that this article is also engaged in the circumstances of this case.  I note that in SP v EB & KP Mostyn J indicated that an Art. 20 defence can only be established exceptionally “as routine use of it would risk undermining the core purposes of the Convention”.  Whilst I am satisfied that in the circumstances of this case, K would find returning to the USA intolerable within the scope of the meaning set out by Baroness Hale in Re D, I am not persuaded that such a return would “not be permitted by the fundamental principles of [England and Wales] relating to the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms”.  A summary return under the Hague Convention will, in many cases, involve a level of interference with a child’s Art. 8 ECHR rights and in my judgment the court should be very cautious before acceding to an Art. 20 defence under the 1980 Convention based on an alleged interference with this right.  I am not satisfied here that the interference with K’s Art. 8 rights here is such as to bring this case within Art. 20 and would dismiss this ground of defence.
CONCLUSION
For the reasons set out above I set aside the Return Order of 31 July 2024 and dismiss the mother’s application under the 1980 Convention for a summary return of K to the USA.
I recognise that this judgment will be difficult for KS to accept.  However, I hope that the conclusion of these proceedings may provide an opportunity for both K and KS to start to rebuild their relationship, and I would reiterate the importance that both of K’s parents now provide him with support and encouragement to do so.
That is my judgment.

JUDGE HUGHES
MEMBER MATTHEWS
MEMBER YATES
Between
ROBERT ANGUS HILL
Appellant
and
INFORMATION COMMISSIONER (IC)
SHEFFIELD CITY COUNCIL (SCC)
Respondent(s)
Decision: The appeal is Dismissed
REASONS
In 2007 a significant redevelopment called the New Retail Quarter was being proposed in Sheffield and an inquiry was held into a Compulsory Purchase Order.  The Appellant in this FOIA case is a director of a company which owned a property affected by the proposed CPO.  As a result of the financial crisis triggered by the reckless management of financial risk in the USA sub-prime mortgage market through the use of collateralised debt obligations (CDOs) the envisaged development did not take place in the way originally planned.  There has been litigation by the company against SCC and the Appellant has made a significant number of FOI requests to SCC.
On 14 July 2023 the Appellant wrote to SCC:
“Thank you for your e mail of [date redacted] containing the two Agreements requested. SCC has confirmed that those two Agreements were not placed before the September CPO NRQ Public inquiry.
I request pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act 2000 a copy of the advice given to the Council that lead to those Agreements being withheld from the Inquiry”
On 12 August SCC replied relying on s12(2) FOIA confirming that it could neither confirm nor deny holding the information in accordance with its duty under S1(1) of FOIA by reason of the cost of ascertaining whether it did would exceed the financial limit of £450 or 18 hours work.
The Appellant complained to the IC who investigated and issued his decision notice IC-263669-H2H0 on 29 April 2024.  He recorded what he had been told by SCC that the Council had
“no records that go back to when such advice would be given.  We are unsure if it ever was.  Any Sheffield City Council records that were contemporaneous with the public inquiry have long since been destroyed or lost.”
SCC further explained that any such advice would have been given by one of the two firms acting for it at the time, these were DLA LLP and Herbert Smith (both firms continue under slightly different names).  DLA’s records had been searched for a previous information request and accordingly if the information existed in recorded form it would be held by Herbert Smith Freehills (HSF) at its London offices. There were 28 boxes of records held by that firm and it would be necessary to dispatch officers to London to search. HSF had confirmed that the records had not even superficially been examined and it was not known what they held.    The IC’s view of the travel, subsistence and accommodation costs as well as travelling time totalled £500 before any search was undertaken.  If the records were in Sheffield the IC considered that 14 hours would be needed to search them which would not leave enough money to pay the transport costs.  There was also a need to meet the cost of an HSF employee accompanying the files.  He was satisfied that s12(2) FOIA applied:
12 Exemption where cost of compliance exceeds appropriate limit.
Section 1(1) does not oblige a public authority to comply with a request for information if the authority estimates that the cost of complying with the request would exceed the appropriate limit.
Subsection (1) does not exempt the public authority from its obligation to comply with paragraph (a) of section 1(1) unless the estimated cost of complying with that paragraph alone would exceed the appropriate limit.
In appealing against this the Appellant argued bad faith on the part of SCC, that he had recently obtained the Master development Agreement from 2006 and a draft lease from 2007.  He challenged the costs and time estimates arguing that material would be in chronological order and easily searched.
The IC maintained the position set out in its decision, noting that the approach of the Appellant begged the question of whether the advice existed and the issue to be addressed was the cost of determining, within the available records, whether or not it existed.  He considered the estimate from SCC which he had considered was reasonable, realistic, sensible and supported by cogent evidence.
On 5 October the tribunal, having considered the bundle and such statements as the statement by the IC in seeking information from SCC:
“Please also explain how you determined that no information is held by the Council apart from those documents held on its behalf by solicitors, that falls within the scope of the request:”
In the light of this approach to legal records held by firms of independent solicitors the tribunal felt significant issues had not been properly addressed by the parties and made a direction in the following terms:
“SCC had long since destroyed the relevant records.  Solicitors which formerly acted for it in connection with the CPO hold records.  However such records are held (primarily) by the solicitors for their own purposes, to comply with regulatory obligations and in order to defend the firm against litigation.  From the material before the tribunal it appears that SCC has, possibly in the light of litigation by a company with which the Appellant is associated, approached solicitors which acted for it in relation to long completed transactions for information.  While the solicitors will continue to have obligations to its former client the status of any information held by the solicitor needs analysis – is such information ”held” by SCC for the purpose of access by a private individual to information held by a public authority?
The requested information, if it exists, is legal advice relating to a statutory inquiry into the making of a Compulsory Purchase Order for the acquisition of land by SCC.  As such is the correct information access regime Freedom of Information Act or Environmental Information Regulations?”
In responding to the direction the IC argued that FOIA was the correct information regime and that:
“the Commissioner’s position is that the fact whether information is held by SCC, held on behalf of SCC, or exists but not held by SCC is ‘secondary’ and not the main issue for the Tribunal to determine”
SCC responded
“We have obtained our own quote for the transport of the twenty-eight boxes to SCC. The quote is £262 plus VAT. However, this is independent of HSF and does not account for any fees they may think applicable.
Our submission therefore is that if HSF accepted that the boxes belonged to SCC and were prepared to release them to SCC the cost for a courier would be £262 plus VAT.”
In the light of this inconclusive response the tribunal further directed:
The jurisdiction of this tribunal to determine appeals in relation to FOIA and EIR is set out in s58 FOIA which provides:
“58 Determination of appeals.
If on an appeal under section 57 the Tribunal considers—
(a)that the notice against which the appeal is brought is not in accordance with the law, or
(b)to the extent that the notice involved an exercise of discretion by the Commissioner, that he ought to have exercised his discretion differently,
the Tribunal shall allow the appeal or substitute such other notice as could have been served by the Commissioner; and in any other case the Tribunal shall dismiss the appeal.
On such an appeal, the Tribunal may review any finding of fact on which the notice in question was based.”
The request relates to the conduct of the Council’s case before a statutory inquiry into a Compulsory Purchase Order relating to the acquisition of land for the construction of a shopping centre.  The definition of environmental information in Regulation 2(1) is wide ranging and the “measure” to which the requested information relates could encompasses the decision-making concerning a significant programme of demolition and building in Sheffield.
The ICO’s decision notice did not address the EIR/FOIA bifurcation and relied on the cost limit in FOIA s12(2) for which there is no equivalent provision in EIR; reliance on regulation 12(4)(b) (sometimes regarded as broadly equivalent) raises different considerations.
The decision notice is based on the proposition that if the requested information is still held by solicitors acting for the Council at the time of the Inquiry it is held by the Council.
• FOIA provides by section 3:
For the purposes of this Act, information is held by a public authority if—
it is held by the authority, otherwise than on behalf of another person, or
it is held by another person on behalf of the authority.
• EIR provides by regulation 3:
For the purposes of these Regulations, environmental information is held by a public authority if the information—
is in the authority’s possession and has been produced or received by the authority; or
is held by another person on behalf of the authority.
In order to determine whether the information requested is within the scope of either information access regime the basis upon which the solicitors (some 16 years after the Inquiry and apparently long after the Council destroyed its own records) continued to hold the information that they hold at the time the request was made.
I direct that by 10 January 2025:
• both Respondents to file submissions as to the correct information access regime,
• the Second Respondent (having consulted the external solicitors for their understanding) to file submissions and evidence as to whether, at the date of the request, the information was or was not held on behalf of the Second Respondent, and
• the First Respondent to file submissions on the status of records in the possession of external solicitors after the relevant proceedings have concluded and the retainer relating to those proceedings has come to an end.
• The Appellant is at liberty to file submissions on these issues by the same date.
In response to this direction the ICO recognised that
The Commissioner wishes to make clear that, during his investigation, SCC maintained it had a degree of control over the records in the law firm’s possession which led the Commissioner to make the reasonable assumption it was held by SCC.
The Commissioner was therefore surprised to read SCC’s submissions on 22 November 2024 in which it stated it has not had confirmation from the law firm that the information is held by SCC.
Notwithstanding this, and the fact that the Directions order SCC to provide more comprehensive evidence as to whether or not it (SCC) holds the information, the Commissioner’s position on information held by external solicitors after the relevant proceedings have concluded and the retainer relating to those proceedings has come to an end are as follows:
The Commissioner’s guidance explores this scenario and says it is possible that a legal firm is holding information on an authority’s behalf to the extent its not holding it solely for their (the legal firm’s) own purposes (i.e. to defend themselves in negligence claims). The guidance gives an example of an FTT case Francis vs Information Commissioner and South Essex Partnership NHS Foundation Trust, EA/2007/0091 (21 July 2008)) where the Tribunal found the firm was holding the information on the authority’s behalf. The EIR equivalent in the guidance has the same position, although in the example used there the Tribunal reached the opposite conclusion (ie the information was not held by the solicitors on the authority’s behalf).
It appears it is a question of fact depending on the circumstances of each individual case:
In this case, SCC said that Council’s records relating to the inquiry would have “long since been destroyed or lost” [para. 17 of the DN]. This signals a disposal decision of the records (or their misplacement) that SCC was holding for its own purposes. In this scenario, the question should then be whether SCC entrusted the legal firm with the safe keeping of its own records so that it could be argued the firm is holding them on the SCC’s behalf for the purposes of the legislation. One would normally expect these arrangements (i.e. whether a third party is managing records on the authority’s behalf) to be documented somewhere, e.g. in a Records Management and Retention and Disposal policy (see for example paea. 2.3 of Code of Practice on the management of records issued under section 46 of the Freedom of Information Act).”
SCC in responding noted that the IC had in cases relating to CPOs resolved some relying on FOIA and others using EIR.  With respect to the status of material held by external solicitors SCC noted that in connection with a previous request where the material was in the possession of solicitors DLA which had also acted for SCC in 2007; the solicitors’ insurers had insisted on conditions relating to SCC access to the records to inspect them which had cost SCC £4,219, in the light of this:
“We believe the conditions under which the records were accessed indicate that at the time of Mr Hills’ request on 13 July 2023 the information was not held on behalf of the Council.”
Consideration
It is clear that in assessing this information request neither SCC nor IC thoroughly assessed the request, the information, where the information (if it existed) was held and the reason it was where it was.  SCC had indicated during the IC’s investigation:
“no records that go back to when such advice would be given.  We are unsure if it ever was.  Any Sheffield City Council records that were contemporaneous with the public inquiry have long since been destroyed or lost.”
However instead of recognising that this clearly indicated that within the Council’s records management policy the retention period for such a record had elapsed and accordingly the Council no longer held any such information, the Council (under the pressure and in the context of the litigation the Appellant’s company had commenced) considered the question of records held by the firms of solicitors which it had instructed nearly two decades before.  What is clear is that any records held by those solicitors were their own records; hence the requirement of DLA’s insurers that DLA control and supervise access to the records at considerable expense to the Council.  While from the Council’s perspective such expenditure may be appropriate in obtaining any necessary evidence to assist in the defence of high value litigation there is no requirement to seek information which it does not hold for the purposes of FOIA.
The position of the firms of solicitors is equally straightforward.  The firms will have their own retention periods for information which they hold; such periods determined in the light of risk management in respect of possible claims against the firm.  As long as they hold the information they will have certain obligations with respect to it; notably a duty of confidentiality to the client which instructed the firm with respect to the transaction or proceedings to which the records relate, however these are the firm’s records – there are duties owed to the former client but the records do not belong to the client and they are not held on behalf of the client.
It is clear, on a consideration of the evidence, that the IC erred in not determining as a first step whether, in the light of the clear statement that SCC had destroyed contemporary records, SCC now held any such record.  The tribunal is satisfied, taking into account the evidence reviewed above (in particular the significant costs incurred on the previous request) that the records held by Herbert Smith Freehills are the firm’s own records and not those of SCC.
The IC proceeded on the basis that information held by solicitors was held by SCC.  On that premise it concluded that the costs of determining whether the information was held meant that the costs provision in s12(2) applied.  Having tested the evidence with relation to costs the tribunal is satisfied that the IC’s decision on this point is robust.
Accordingly the tribunal dismisses the appeal and further finds that if the IC was correct in treating any such information held by the solicitors as within the scope of FOIA then the costs provisions in s12 justified refusal.

Judgment
Bruce Carr KC (Sitting as a Deputy High Court Judge) :
Introduction
On 15 October 2021, the Claimant, Mr Mark Chassy, issued a Claim Form and Particulars of Claim in which he sought damages for breach of contract based on a failure by the First Defendant to pay various sums which he claimed were due under the terms of a contract of employment originally entered into between himself and NMQA Limited (“NMQA”) on 17 May 2012. The claims against the First Defendant were based on the contract having been transferred to the First Defendant on 1 January 2014 and by operation of law pursuant to the provisions of the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations 2006 (“TUPE”). The claims were however, not limited to ones arising out of his own contract alone but also covered the contracts of four other individuals whose employment had also been transferred to the First Defendant pursuant to TUPE or who had otherwise come to be employed by the First Defendant. The relevant individuals were as follows:
David Aistrup, whose employment also transferred on I January 2014 under TUPE;
Alex Cardoso, who was employed by the First Defendant under the terms of a contract of employment dated 10 July 2015;
Paulo Macinanti, who was employed by the First Defendant from 8 January 2014;
Eduardo Sousa, who was employed by the First Defendant under the terms of a contract of employment dated 14 July 2015.
The Claimant and the four individuals named above (collectively referred to as “the Former Employees”) had terminated their employment with the First Defendant by resignation on 26 April 2019. Those terminations were considered by an Employment Tribunal which, by a judgment dated 25 June 2020, concluded that the Former Employees had all been constructively (and unfairly) dismissed from their employment with the First Defendant as of 26 April 2019 and awarded compensation in accordance with the statutory scheme contained in the Employment Rights Act 1996 (“ERA”). In her Judgment, Employment Judge Brown acknowledged that those statutory proceedings did not relate to or include any claims for breach of contract or unpaid wages.
Mr Aistrup is sadly now deceased. However, on 29 October 2020, the executor of his estate assigned to the Claimant all claims relating to his former employment with the First Defendant. Similar assignments were made personally by Mr Cardoso (on 11 November 2020), Mr Macinanti (on 3 November 2020) and Mr Sousa (8 November 2020). As a result, the Claimant claims to be the legal assignee of the rights of the relevant individuals (“the Assignors”) based on similar breaches of contract to those which he pursues in his own name.
The Claimant also pursues claims against the Second and Third Defendants in respect of the losses that are alleged to flow from the breaches by the First Defendant of his own contracts of employment as well as those of the Assignors. Those claims are pursued on the basis that the Second and Third Defendants were directors of the First Defendant at all times material to such claims and that in that capacity, they are jointly and severally liable for all of the losses said to flow from the First Defendant’s breaches of the contracts of employment of the Former Employees, they being said to have induced or procured such breaches.
The claims brought by the Former Employees can broadly be broken down as follows:
Non-payment of salary over varying periods of months;
Non-payment of pension contributions (with the exception of Mr Aistrup, for reasons which will be explained below);
Non-payment of expenses incurred in the course of employment (in relation to the Claimant alone);
Non-payment of holiday entitlement.
The total damages claimed by the Claimant in relation to the claims of the Former Employees was set out in the Particulars of Claim at £311,601.91. The Claimant also claimed statutory interest pursuant to section 35A Senior Courts Act 1981.
In a Defence dated 17 February 2023 and filed on behalf of all three Defendants, issue was taken with the legal status of the assignments made to the Claimant by the Assignors. It was admitted that the Second Defendant was a registered director of the First Claimant from 8 January 2014 to 9 November 2016 and from 14 April 2021 onwards – but not otherwise, either on a registered or de facto basis. As to the Third Defendant, it was admitted that he was a registered director between 22 January 2014 and 26 April 2021 – but again, not otherwise, either on a registered or de facto basis.
As to the substance of the claims brought against it, the position of the Defendants in summary and as set out in their Defence was as follows:
In relation to unpaid wages, whilst non-payment was admitted to a limited extent by the First Defendant, the Former Employees had consented to variations in the terms of their contracts of employment or had otherwise acquiesced in or waived any breaches of contract. It was also asserted that the Former Employees were estopped from pursuing such claims, given that they were aware of financial difficulties which the First Defendant had faced but nevertheless continued to work in the knowledge that it was not possible for the First Defendant to pay their wages;
The claim in respect of non-payment of pension contributions was admitted by the First Defendant subject only to a defence of set-off based on allegations relating to the Claimant’s conduct at the point at which he resigned from his employment with the First Defendant. The Defendants’ case collectively is that they had intended to enrol the Former Employees into a company pension scheme once the First Defendant was on a firmer financial footing;
The claims in respect of payment for unused holiday entitlement, and again subject to the defence of set-off,  were admitted to a limited extent by the First Defendant based on its assertion that the contractual entitlement to carry over and be paid for unused holiday was limited to 5 days, with a further 5 days if permission was given and that payment on lieu on termination of employment was in any event at the discretion of the directors of the First Defendant;
The Second and Third Defendants admitted that, whilst they were statutory directors of the First Defendant, they owed the duties set out in sections 172 and 174 Companies Act 2006. They denied however, that they had acted in breach of such duties, asserting that they had at all times acted in good faith in their attempts to carry on the business of the First Claimant during periods of financial difficulty.
As set out above, a claim of set off was also advanced in the Defence by all three Defendants based on the assertion that the Claimant had acted in breach of his contract of employment – in particular his express obligations with regard to confidentiality and the implied term of trust and confidence – by embarking “on a course of deliberate deletion, removal and misuse of confidential data belonging to” the First Defendant. The allegation was that the Claimant had deliberately removed important confidential information of the First Defendant which had been contained in a software messaging application known as “Slack” to which the Claimant had had access during the course of his employment up to the point at which he had resigned from the First Defendant in April 2019.
The position of the Third Defendant
The Third Defendant did not prepare any witness evidence for the purpose of the trial and did not otherwise engage with the litigation after the Defence was filed on his behalf. The apparent reason for that emerged shortly before the trial was due to commence, when it was discovered that he may be an undischarged bankrupt. This issue came to the attention of the Claimant on 8 October 2024 when it was disclosed in the course of a without prejudice letter sent to him on behalf of the First and Second Defendants.
The Claimant’s solicitors then attempted to do what they could to check the position and discovered an entry on the Bankruptcy Register which bore a similar name to that of the Third Defendant. The questions which then arose for consideration before me were first, whether the evidence demonstrated that the Third Defendant was indeed subject to a bankruptcy order and secondly, if so, how should the court proceed. Ms Grossman on behalf of the Claimant, sought to persuade me that the trial should continue to judgment as regards the claim against the Third Defendant in order to “prevent injustice and delay” and that there would be a significant impact on the Claimant (and the Assignors) should matters not proceed against him. Whilst section 285(2) Insolvency Act 1986, on proof of bankruptcy, gives the power to either stay proceedings or allow them to continue on such terms as the court thinks fit, this should not prevent the court proceeding to judgment as it would only be at the stage of enforcement that there would be a potential impact on the estate of the bankrupt individual. The trial should therefore continue with any required safeguards in relation to the bankruptcy being addressed only if and when enforcement became an issue.
On the evidence provided to me, I was satisfied that the Third Defendant was indeed an undischarged bankrupt. I then concluded that the trial should be allowed to continue on the basis that, as proffered by Ms Grossman on behalf of the Claimant, he would be subject to an undertaking not to enforce any judgment against the Third Defendant without leave of the Court or written agreement of the Defendant’s trustee in bankruptcy. I did consider whether the Third Defendant was prejudiced by this course of action but ultimately concluded that given that he had clearly taken no step to engage in the proceedings, an adjournment of the trial was not appropriate. In addition, his interests were substantially aligned with those of the Second Defendant who of course was present at and participated in the trial process and was able to put forward arguments that were supportive of not only his, but also the Third Defendant’s position, particularly on the key issue of individual liability for inducement to breach of contract by the First Defendant.
The issues for determination
By the time that the matter came before me for trial, the issues had been agreed between the Claimant and the First and Second Defendants as follows:
What sums were due to be paid, but were not paid and have not been paid to each of the Former Employees pursuant to their contracts of employment and/or any relevant statutory obligation?
Have the claims arising out of any alleged sums being assigned to the Claimant?
Did any of the Former Employees waive any right to any sum, and can the defendants rely upon any such waiver?
When each of the Second and Third Defendants were not registered directors at Companies House, did either of them continue to be a de facto director and therefore continue to owe obligations pursuant to the Companies Act 2006?
Did the Second Defendant or the Third Defendant breach those obligations?
Is the First Defendant liable for sums owed to the Former Employees and if so, in what amounts?
Are the Second Defendant and/or the Third Defendant personally liable for those sums, (or any part of them)?
What amount would be due by way of interest to the Claimant?
Did the Claimant cause information to be lost to the First Defendant which was commercially viable to it? Did the Claimant deliberately take actions to cause loss and damage to the First Defendant?
If so, was that loss in breach of a duty owed to the First Defendant?
What loss was caused (pursuant to the usual principles of causation) to the First Defendant? What quantum of any alleged loss can be proved?
In addition, the List of Issues prepared for trial also contained further matters set out under the heading: “Second Defendant’s Further Issues – Unagreed”. Although described as “the Second Defendant’s” issues, the questions set out dealt in large part with the points raised in the Defendants’ set off defence based on the alleged conduct of the Claimant. Further, although described as “Unagreed”, no particular point has been taken (by the Claimant) in relation to them. In any event, issues (1) and (3) in that list appear to me to raise evidential points which bear directly on the questions raised under Issues (9)-(11) on the agreed list. Issue (2) on the unagreed list relates to the alleged retention of laptop computers by the Former Employees after their employment came to an end when they resigned. Again, this point has not featured in the submissions made by counsel and in any event, does not appear to me to have any bearing on the issues that I have to determine.
That leaves two further points (Issues (4) and (5)) in the unagreed list which raise questions more broadly about the conduct of the Second and Third Defendants in their running of the First Defendant and what were the “pivotal events” which resulted in the First Defendant experiencing significant cashflow issues in 2018-2019. Whilst I can see that some of this might be relevant to questions of whether the Second and Third Defendants acted in breach of the duties that they owed as directors of the First Defendant, again they appear to me to be discrete points based on the evidence in the case which may then impact on Issue (7) of the agreed list. I do not see them as separate questions which require individual or separate consideration outside the scope of those issues which have been agreed between the parties. In addition, again, I did not understand Mr Innes to make any separate or distinct submissions in relation to them.
Legal Principles
One of the key questions in these proceedings is the extent to which the Second and/or Third Defendants are personally liable as directors of the First Defendant on the basis that the former induced or procured breaches of contract by the latter. In support of his assertion that they are so liable, the Claimant relies on the provisions of sections 172 and 174 Companies Act 2006 (“CA”). Section 172 CA reads as follows:
A director of a company must act in the way which he considers, in good faith, would be most likely to promote the success of the company for the benefit of its members as a whole., and in doing so must have regard (amongst other matters) to –
the likely consequences 0f any decision in the long term,
the interests of the company's employees,
the need to foster the company's business relationships with suppliers, customers, and others,
……
the desirability of the company maintaining a reputation for high standards of business conduct, and.
the need to act fairly as between members of the company.”
Section 174 CA sets out a director’s duty to act with reasonable care, skill and diligence and provides as follows:
A director of a company must exercise reasonable care, skill, and diligence.
This means the care, skill and diligence that would be exercised by a reasonably diligent person with –
The general knowledge, skill, and experience that may reasonably be expected of a person carrying out. The functions carried out by the director in relation to the company, and
the general knowledge, skill, and experience that the director has.”
In Antuzis v DJ Houghton Catching Services Limited [2019] Bus LR 1532, Lane J dealt with an application for  summary judgement made by a number of Claimants (who had been employed as chicken catchers) who claimed that the Defendant company, in failing to pay their wages, making unlawful deductions and not providing holiday pay, had breached contractual terms which were express or which had impliedly been incorporated into their contracts  by virtue of a number of statutory provisions. The Claimants made an application for summary judgment against the company but also sought to establish that its sole director and company secretary were personally or severally liable for the company’s breaches of contract.
In addressing the issue of the individual liability of directors, Lane J held that in determining whether a director, by failing to act bona fide, was liable for inducing breach of contract by a company, it was their conduct and intention in relation to their duties towards the company, not to third parties, that provided the focus of the enquiry. Nevertheless, the nature of any breach which had occurred between the company and the third party, and its consequences were relevant to the issue of personal liability in respect of that third party. Where a director causes a company to commit breaches of contract, which also involve breaches of statutory duty and where this causes severe reputational damage to the company, this could indicate that the director had acted in breach of the duty to act in good faith to promote the company’s success. On the facts of the case, Lane J held that the malpractice of which the director and company secretary were guilty, had “catastrophic consequences” for the company and that they as directors had not acted bona fide towards it. On that basis, they were held to be jointly and severally liable to the Claimants for inducing the company’s breaches of contract.
It is important to record that Lane J’s conclusions were very much based on the facts of the case as he found them to be. For example, at paragraph 86, he stated as follows:
“The evidence is, however, simply overwhelming that D2 and D3 were operating D1 at all material times in a deliberate and systematic manner, whereby chicken catchers were working massively more than the hours recorded on the pay slips. If this was not so, then there would have been no need to engage in the fictional exercise [in relation to the recording of hours worked] which D2 and D3 required of Ms Shanks. That exercise was necessary because (contrary to the assertion that such a thing was impossible) no records were being kept by D2 and D3 of the hours worked by chicken catchers. The reason why no records were being kept was because D2 and D3's modus operandi involved a flagrant disregard of the [Agricultural Workers Order] requirements as to minimum pay.”
Under the heading “K. Preliminary issue” Lane J dealt with the law relating to the liability of directors for torts and breaches of contract committed by a company. At paragraph 108, the judgment reads as follows:
The general principle is that directors of a company will be liable for the torts of the company, committed at their direction.
In Rainham Chemical Works Ltd v Belveder Fish Guano Co Ltd [1921] 2 AC 465, 367, Lord Buckmaster held:
“If the company was really trading independently on its own account, the fact that it was directed by Messrs Feldman and Partridge would not render them responsible for its tortious act, unless, indeed, they were acts expressly directed by them. If... those in control expressly directed that a wrongful thing can be done, the individuals as well as the company are responsible for the consequences.”
A somewhat different position obtains, however, where the unlawful act is procuring a breach of contract. In Said v Butt [1923] KB 497, the plaintiff procured a theatre ticket, which was not in his name, knowing that if his true identity had been known, he would have been refused admission, owing to a dispute between him and the theatre company. McCardie J held that non-disclosure of the fact that the ticket was bought for the plaintiff prevented the sale of the ticket from constituting a contract, the identity of the plaintiff being a material element in its formation. For that reason, the action failed.
However, McCardie J made these obiter observations at pp 505 and 506:
“But the servant who causes a breach of his master's contract with a third person seems to stand in a wholly different position. He is not a stranger. He is the alter ego of his master. His acts are in law, the acts of his employer. In such a case, it is the master himself, by his agent, breaking the contract he has made, and in my view, the action against the agent... must therefore fail, just as it would fail if brought against the master himself for wrongfully procuring a breach of his own contract...
“I hold that if a servant acting bona fide within the scope of his authority procures or causes the breach of contract between his employer and a third person, he does not become liable to an action in tort at the suit of the person whose contract has thereby been broken. I abstain from expressing any opinion as to the law which may apply if a servant, acting as an entire stranger, wholly outside the range of his powers, procures his master to wrongfully break a contract with a third person.””
Having reviewed the authorities relating to what the judge called the “so-called rule in Said v Butt”, Lane J said this at paragraph 114:
“The conclusion of Waller J in Ridgeway Maritime v Beulah Wings Ltd [1991] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 611, cited in para 57 of the judgment, points towards the conclusion that I draw: namely that it is the officer’s conduct and intention in relation to his duties towards the company – not towards the third party – that provide the focus of the “bona fide” inquiry to be undertaken pursuant to the rule in Said v Butt [1920] 3 KB 497.
This does not, however, mean that the nature of the breach of contract which occurs between the company and the third party is irrelevant. On the contrary, the nature of the breach and its consequences, may directly inform whether the officer of the company has breached his or her duties towards the company.”
At paragraph 116 of his judgment, Lane J noted a submission made by counsel for the Claimants to the effect that the breaches of contract committed by the Defendant company also involved breaches of statutory duty rather than as a result of ‘arm’s-length agreements struck between the claimants and D1. Those duties were statutorily imposed by Parliament in order to protect vulnerable workers from exploitative employers. The judgment then continues at paragraph 117 with a reference to a comment made by counsel for the Defendants, Mr Allen, in response to the submission made with regard to statutory duties:
Mr Allen made the valid observation that merely procuring a breach of contract of this kind cannot be the touchstone for deciding if the director is liable. If it were, then directors would, in the employment field, regularly face personal liability. Because many aspects of employment contracts have a statutory element. Such a conclusion, he said, cannot be right.
I agree. However, Mr Hendy’s submission cannot be so easily circumvented. As we have seen, Section 172 of the Companies Act 2006 imposes important duties on directors to act in good faith so as to promote the success of the company and, in so doing, to have regard to matters such as ‘the likely consequences of any decision in the long term; the interests of the Company's employees; the impact of the Company's operations on the community; and the desirability of the company maintaining a reputation for high standards of business conduct”. Section 174 of the same Act imposes a duty on the director to exercise reasonable care, skill, and diligence.
The nature of the breach of contract is directly relevant to the determination of whether, in a particular case, a director has complied with section 172, as regards his or her duty to the company and the ultimate question whether inducing the breach is actionable against the director.
There is, plainly a world of difference between, on the one hand, a director consciously and deliberately causing a company to breach its contracts with a supplier, by not paying the supplier on time because, unusually, the company has encountered cash flow difficulties, and, on the other hand, a director of a restaurant company who decides the company should supply customers of the chain with burgers made of horse meat instead of beef, on the basis that horse meat is cheaper. In the second example, the resulting scandal, when the director's actions come to light, would be, at the very least, likely to inflict severe reputational damage on the company, from which it might take years to recover, if it recovered at all.
In this particular example, the fact that supplying horse meat is likely to violate food and trading standards legislation is plainly relevant because it is society's disapproval of acting in this manner that gives rise to the statutory duty, and the breach of that duty is therefore indicative of societal disapproval of what the director has caused the company to do and the resulting reputational damage to the company.
Accordingly, as a general matter, the fact that the breach of contract has such a statutory element may point to there being a failure on the part of the director to comply with his or her duties to the company and, by extension, to the director's liability to a third party for inducing a breach of contract. Whether such a breach has these effects, will depend on the circumstances of the particular case.”
The judge then went on to make a finding, based on the facts of the case, that the Defendant directors were not acting bona fide vis-à-vis the Defendant company by not paying the Claimants in accordance with their contractual and statutory entitlements. Damning findings were made, leading to the conclusion that the directors were fully aware that they were “unable as a matter of law to act in this way on behalf of D1” (see paragraph 126). The motivation for their conduct was then described in paragraph 127 as follows:
“D2 and D3 did all these things because they were concerned to maximise the profits of D1, which they - and only they - enjoyed. But just as in the restaurant example, the desire to maximise profits has had catastrophic consequences for D1. When the malpractices finally came to light, D1's fortunes dramatically declined. Far from having a reputation for high standards of business conduct, D1 stands exposed as a pariah.
Before the exposure of D1, D2 and D3's activities were manifestly not in the interests of the company's employees, so far as the chicken catchers were concerned. Following exposure, their activities can be seen not to have been in the interests of any of the employees, since there are no longer any supervisors or drivers.
……
In short, D2 and D3 were not acting bona fide vis-a-vis D1. It is, accordingly, necessary to turn to OBG Ltd v Alan [2007] Bus LR 1600 in order to determine whether D2 and/or D3, acting in their own right, are liable for inducing breach of contract.
For our purposes, the following passage of the judgement of Lord Hoffman is relevant:
To be liable for inducing breach of contract, you must know that you are inducing a breach of contract. It is not enough that you know that you are procuring an act which, as a matter of law or construction of the contract, is a breach. You must actually realise that it will have this effect. Nor does it matter that you ought reasonably to have done so. This proposition is most strikingly illustrated by the decision of this House in British Industrial Plastics Limited v Ferguson [1941] All ER 479, in which the plaintiff’s former employee offered the defendant information about one of the plaintiff’s secret processes  which he, as an employee, had invented. The defendant knew that the employee had a contractual obligation not to reveal trade secrets, but held the eccentric opinion that if the process was patentable, it would be the exclusive property of the employee. He took information in the honest belief that the employee would not be in breach of contract. In the Court of Appeal, McKinnon LJ observed tartly that in accepting this evidence, the judge had “vindicated his honesty at the expense of his intelligence” but he and the House of Lords agreed that he could not be liable for inducing a breach of contract.
The question of what counts as knowledge for the purposes of liability for inducing a breach of contract has also been the subject of a consistent line of decisions. In Emerald Construction Company Limited -v- Lowthian [1966] 1 WLR 691, union officials threatened a building contractor with a strike unless he terminated a contract for the supply of labour. The defendants obviously knew that there was a contract - they wanted it terminated- but the court found that they did not know its terms. And, in particular, how it, how soon it could be terminated. Lord Denning, MR said “even if they did not know the actual terms of the contract but had the means of the knowledge - which they deliberately disregarded - that would be enough. Like the man who turns a blind eye. So here, if the officers deliberately sought to get the contract terminated, heedless of its terms, regardless of whether it was terminated by breach or not, they would do wrong. For it is unlawful for a third person to procure a breach of contract knowingly, or recklessly, indifferent whether it is a breach or not’.
This statement of the law has since been followed in many cases, and, so far as I am aware, has not given rise to any difficulty. It is in accordance with the general principle of law that a conscious decision not to inquire into the existence of a fact is in many cases treated as equivalent to knowledge of that fact.
………..
The next question is what counts as an intention to procure a breach of contract. It is necessary for this purpose to distinguish between ends, means and consequences. If someone knowingly causes a breach of contract, it does not normally matter that it that it is the means by which he intends to achieve some further end. Or even that he would rather have been able to achieve that end without causing a breach. Mr Guy would very likely have preferred to be able to obtain Miss Wagner services without her having to break her contract. But it did not matter. Again, people seldom knowingly cause loss by unlawful means, out of simply disinterested malice. It is usually to achieve the further end of securing an economic advantage to themselves.
………
On the other hand, if the breach of contract is neither an end in itself nor a means to an end, but merely a foreseeable consequence, then in my opinion it cannot for this purpose be said to have been intended. That, I think, is what judges and writers mean when they say that the claimant must have been “targeted” or “aimed at”. In my opinion, the majority of the Court of Appeal was wrong to have allowed the action in Miller v Bassey [1994] EMLR 44 to proceed. Miss Bassey had broken her contract to perform for the record company, and it was a foreseeable consequence that the recording company would have to break its contract with accompanying musicians, But those breaches of contract were neither an end desired by Miss Bassey nor a means of achieving that end.
……’
I have no hesitation in finding that both D2 and D3 satisfy the requirements laid out by Lord Hoffman. I am in no doubt whatsoever, having heard the evidence, that both of them “actually realised” that what they were doing involved causing D1 to breach its contractual obligations towards the Claimants. What they did was the means to an end. There is no iota of credible evidence that either D2 or D3 possessed an honest belief that what they were doing would not involve such a breach. On the contrary, the evidence is overwhelmingly to the contrary. At all times, each knew exactly what they were, that what he or she was doing. The breaches they occasioned were central to D1’s modus operandi.
Judgment in the preliminary issue will be entered in favour of the Claimants. D2 and D3 are jointly and severally liable to the claimants for inducing the breaches of contract of D1.”
Lane J’s conclusion therefore, that the Second and Third Defendants were personally liable for inducing breaches of contracts by the company of which they were officers, was a finding made in circumstances of deliberate and repeated violations of contractual and statutory provisions, the latter in particular being part of a framework designed to protect vulnerable workers from exploitation. In inducing the company to act as it did, the individual directors were driven solely by a desire to maximise the profits of the company for their exclusive benefit. In so doing, and focussing on the correct question of whether the directors were in breach of their duty to the company (rather than whether they were acting in bad faith towards the third party whose contract had been breached), it is unsurprising that Lane J should have concluded that the directors could not seek shelter behind the rule in Said v Butt.
Lane J’s approach and analysis was considered by Eyre J in IBM United Kingdom Limited v LZLABS GmbH & Others [2022] EWHC 844 (TCC). Having reviewed that analysis, Eyre J helpfully summarised what he regarded as the proper approach in such cases as follows (at paragraph 36):
“In my judgement, and applying Lane J's analysis, the matter has to be approached on the basis that the question of whether a director acted bona fide and within the scope of his or her authority will be very dependent on the circumstances of the particular case. Regard is to be had to the director's duties to the company. The director will not have been acting bona fide if he or she was in breach of the duties set out in section 172. However, the question must be considered in the round remembering that liability is to be seen as an exception to the general rule that a director will not be liable in tort for inducing the company of which he or she is a director to breach a contract. It follows that not every instance of causing a company to breach a contract or a legal obligation will involve a director in a breach of the section 172 duties nor will every such instance cause him or her to be characterised as acting in bad faith for the purposes of the rule in Said v Butt. The key will be whether the director was properly acting to promote the success of the company taking account of the matters to which he or she is required by section 172 to have regard. In that exercise it will be necessary to consider the circumstances as a whole. Those will include the motivation of the director and the nature of the duties said to be broken but in addition the nature of the obligations being broken by the company and the consequences of the company's breach can be relevant to the question of whether the director can properly have been said to have been acting in the interests of the company.
More recently, the issue of personal liability of directors has been considered by the Court of Appeal in Northamber plc v Genee World Limited & Others [2024] EWCA Civ 428 in which the passages from the judgments of Lane and Eyre JJ which I have cited above were cited with approval in the judgment of Arnold LJ.
In their Defence in the present case, the Defendants say that each of the Former Employees was given the option of leaving to pursue employment elsewhere given the deferment of their wages and return to the First Defendant as and when its financial position improved. None of the Former Employees took that option (such as it was) but according to the pleaded Defence “by their statements and/or actions, they elected to continue to work for [the First Defendant] in the full knowledge that [it] was not in a position to pay their salaries and that there was a risk that it would not be able to do so.” This was said by the Defendants to amount to consent and/or an agreement and/or a representation that they would continue to work for the First Defendant and would not advance any contractual claim in respect of unpaid salary. It was then said that the First Defendant had reasonably relied on to its detriment by continuing to employ them, rather than terminating their employment and/or liquidating the company. In his opening Skeleton Argument, and by reference to paragraph 10 of the Defence in which the above references appear, Mr Innes suggested that the unpaid wages claim should fail on the basis of “waiver/variation/acquiescence and/or estoppel.” By the time  of his Closing Submission, he repeated the assertion (at paragraph 15) that by continuing to work in circumstances in which they were aware of the First Defendant’s financial difficulties, the Former Employees had “represented that they would continue to work for the company and that they would defer and/or forego their salaries and would not claim any contractual right to the same.” Again, it was asserted that the First Defendant had relied on this conduct to its detriment.
A modest concession in relation to this argument was then proffered by Mr Innes in that at paragraph 18 of his Closing Submissions in that he accepted that it could not be maintained that the Former Employees had agreed “to forego their salaries entirely……..[It] seems inevitable that if funds had come in before they left the [First Defendant’s] employment, everyone would have accepted that of course these should be used to make up the missed payments”. The submission continued as follows: “more plausibly, the [Former Employees] elected to defer payment of their salaries unless or until the [First Defendant] was in a financial position to pay them, which did not occur.” I have to confess that, on the basis of the submissions made by Mr Innes, I am not entirely confident as to the precise legal basis on which the election/waiver/variation/estoppel point is put.
If the matter is put in terms of a strict waiver by “election”, the doctrine will generally only apply in a narrow set of circumstances in which a choice is made between two rights or powers. In Data Petroleum (Caribbean) Limited v BVI Electrical Corp [2021] 1 WLR 5741, the matter was put by Lord Leggatt (at paragraph 21) as follows:
“What is fundamental to the principle of waiver by election and crucial for present purposes is that it is only capable of applying where a choice must be made between two alternative and inconsistent (in the sense of mutually exclusive) courses of action, such that adopting one of them necessarily entails forsaking the other.”
If the matter is put as one of variation, one would expect to be able to identify the formation requirements which would apply equally to the formation of a contract, namely offer and acceptance, supported by consideration
If it is put on the potentially broader footing of a waiver by estoppel, one would expect to be able to identify a clear and unequivocal statement or representation (which could be in the form of particular conduct) that a party was giving up a contractual right. Secondly, the party relying on the doctrine would need to show that it had relied on the conduct or representation and thirdly, it would be inequitable to allow the other party to renege from its promise, the waiver generally operating so as to suspend rather than extinguish the right that has been waived.
Section 13 Employment Rights Act (“ERA”) creates a statutory right for a worker not to suffer unauthorised deductions from their wages. Section 13(1) ERA provides as follows:
An employer shall not make a deduction from wages of a worker employed by him unless –
is required or authorised to be made by virtue of a statutory provision or a relevant provision of the workers contract, or.
the worker has previously signified in writing his agreement or consent to the making of the deduction.”
It is suggested on behalf of the Claimant that the effect of this section is to exclude the Defendants from advancing any argument in relation to the claim for non-payment of salary based on any alleged waiver/forbearance/estoppel arguments as none of the matters relied on by the Defendants had been put in writing and agreed to by the Former Employees. The Claimant’s argument is that the contents of section 13(1) ERA is to be implied into the contracts of employment of the Former Employees. I disagree – the purpose of section 13 ERA is to provide a specific, straightforward statutory remedy in cases in which workers claim to have been underpaid. The right of the employer in relation to deductions covered by the section, is limited under section 13(1)(a) and (b) to those to which the worker has agreed as part of his contract or otherwise in writing and with his agreement or consent. Section 23 ERA then provides the worker with a right to complain to an Employment Tribunal in the event that the employer has made a deduction which is not permitted by the exceptions set out in section 13(1)(a) or (b). I do not regard those provisions as, in effect, re-writing the common law position as it applies to waiver, forbearance or estoppel and as it applies to a claim in contract brought in the county court or the High Court.
However, the fact that non-payment of salary amounted to the making of unlawful deductions contrary to the provisions of section ERA, is a factor relevant to the consideration of the question of whether the Second and Third Defendants were acting in bad faith and/or contrary to the duties set out in sections 172 and 174 (as was recognised by Lane J in his judgment in Antuzis to which I have referred above).
In support of their arguments based on set off, the First and Second Defendants rely on the implied term of trust and confidence as set out in Woods v WM Car Services Ltd [1981] ICR 66 as follows:
“It is clearly established that there is implied in a contract of employment a term that employers will not, without reasonable and proper cause, conduct themselves in a manner calculated or likely to destroy or seriously damage
the relationship of confidence or trust between employer and employee.”
Although framed in Woods by reference to the conduct of the employer, the fact that the duty is a mutual one, applying as much to the conduct of the employee as to that of the employer, was recognised by the House of Lords in Malik v BCCI [1977] IRC 606 – see Lord Steyn at page 42F. In any event, the Claimant was subject to an express term in his contract of employment to the effect that he would “in all matters act faithfully to the company.”
The Facts
The First Defendant is a limited company involved in the development and sale of software products. It also offers IT support to purchasers of its products as well as providing software products to its business partner, IBM which the latter would then sell on to its own customers. When IBM did so, the First Defendant would receive royalties based on the use by its customers of the First Defendant’s products. One of its principal sources of income came via another software company named “Green Hat” with which NMQA had built a successful relationship from around 2011 onwards, to the point at which NMQA was Green Hat's most successful independent reseller and implementer of its software. Green Hat (and its software products) were acquired by IBM in 2013.
Following the transfer of the NMQA business to the First Defendant, the commercial success of the link with Green Hat initially continued, enabling the First Defendant to establish and trade on a firm financial footing, with revenues of around £2.5m in 2015. However, in the second quarter of 2016, IBM took the decision to outsource the development, implementation and support of Green Hat products to one of its development partners, HCL. This had a dramatic impact on the First Defendant’s revenue and cashflow and it is perhaps no surprise that from around that time, difficulties began to emerge relating to the payment of salary of the Former Employees. The Claimant attributes the deterioration in the relationship with IBM to what he says were the behaviours of the Second and Third Defendants.
The Former Employees are all IT specialists who, as set out above, were employed by the First Defendant at the times material to the issues in this case. The Claimant first came across the Second and Third Defendants when he was  working under a freelance contract with NMQA. The Second and Third Defendants were directors of NMQA. Part of its business was consulting and that part of the business was eventually moved to a separate company, the First Defendant, as a result of which the contracts of employment of the Claimant and Mr Aistrup were transferred pursuant to TUPE. The Claimant came to be employed from 1 April 2016 on a salary of £95,000 per annum.
Messrs Macinanti, Cardoso and Sousa all joined the First Defendant after the initial transfer of an undertaking from NMQA.
In the Particulars of Claim, the Claimant pleaded the contracts of the Former Employees were all in standard form and contained the following provisions:
Clause 4.1 – salary to be paid monthly in arrears by BACS on or about the 25th day of each calendar month;
Clause 4.2(b) – expenses incurred by employees in the course of their employment would be repaid to them. (It was also suggested that a similar term was to be implied on the basis of custom and practice);
Clauses 7.1 and 7.4 – an entitlement to 25 days holiday each calendar year and pro-rata payment of unused holiday entitlement to be paid on termination of employment;
Clause 7.2 – employees could only take holiday at times permitted by the employer;
Clause 9.1 – a figure amounting to 5% of gross monthly salary to be paid each month by the employer into the employer’s group pension scheme.
At paragraph 7 of their Defence, the Defendants admitted the above express terms save that:
As far as Messrs Cardoso, Macinanti and Sousa were concerned, the initial entitlement was to 22 days but increasing by 1 additional day for each year of employment, subject to a maximum of 25 days. Further, it was said that the obligation in their case to pay 5% of gross salary into the group pension scheme only arose after the successful completion of a 6-month probationary period;
In Mr Aistrup’s case, his holiday entitlement was limited to 22 days.
It is accepted by all parties at trial that the contracts of employment of the Former Employees all contained an express variation clause (“the Unilateral Variation Clause”) in the following terms:
“CHANGES TO THE TERMS OF EMPLOYMENT
The Company reserves the right to make reasonable changes to any of the terms and conditions of employment and in that event the employee will be given not less than 1 (one) month’s written notice of any significant changes by individual notice. Such changes shall be deemed to be accepted unless the employee notifies the Company of any objection in writing before the expiry of the notice period.”
At paragraph 8 of their Defence, the Defendants claimed that the Former Employees were subject to the rules set out in an Employee Handbook “the Handbook”) under which there was a 5-day limit on the amount of holiday that could be carried over from one year to the next and that leave not taken would be lost unless specific provision was given. There was also said to be a maximum of 10 days which could be carried over with permission. The Defendant’s rely on these provisions as limiting the scope of the claims for unpaid holiday advanced by the Former Employees.
The “FOREWORD” to the Handbook contained the following wording:
“The Staff Handbook specifies which policies, procedures and rules are incorporated into your contract of employment.”
Under the heading “Holiday Year”, the Handbook stated that:
“The Company’s holiday year runs from 1 January to 31 December.
Only 5 days leave may be carried out over from one leave year to the next. Leave not taken will be lost unless specific permission is given. The maximum exception with permission is 10 days of carryover.”
And under the heading “Holiday Booking”, the Handbook contained the following:
“On termination of employment, all outstanding annual leave must have been taken prior to the effective date of departure. At the discretion of the Director, payment may be made in lieu of holiday entitlement.”
Pausing for a moment, it is clear that these provisions are both unworkable and unlawful. Unworkable, because an unanticipated date of departure may mean that it was simply not possible to take all annual leave prior to the date of departure (as the facts of this case demonstrate where the Former Employees resigned with immediate effect as they were entitled to do due to non-payment of their contractual entitlements). Unlawful, because Regulation 14 Working Time Regulations 1998 creates a statutory entitlement to payment in lieu where a worker leaves his or her employment at a point at which they have not taken all of the annual leave that has accrued to them as of that date – payment in lieu is therefore a matter of statutory right and not employer discretion.
In late 2016/early 2017, work was carried out in the preparation of the Handbook which was intended to apply to the First Defendant’s employees, including of course, the Former Employees, although none of them who gave evidence at trial recall seeing it or it coming into force. They did however, accept that they may have seen it. I will return to the evidence relating to this below.
Problems with non-payment of salary began to emerge in 2017. By August 2018, salary payments to the Claimant came to a complete stop. Payments to the Assignors became problematic at or around the same time although apparently not to the same extent as had applied to the Claimant. In his evidence, Mr Macinanti said that there had been conversations with the Second and Third Defendants regarding non-payment of salary in which he was told that the First Defendant was unable to pay. At first, employees received a percentage of what was due to them but that from around November/December 2018, he was told that there was no money at all from which to pay salaries. He said he was told that if he wished to get a loan in order to make up the shortfall, the First Defendant would ultimately pay back the loan with interest. He said that the Former Employees were given weekly updates about possible investment, with the Second and Third Defendant seeking to reassure them by saying that “we are so close, we are almost there”. He said in cross-examination that he had decided to stay on in employment on the basis that he was being told by the Defendants that “we will pay you, but we don’t know when.”
Mr Cardoso’s evidence was to similar effect – he said that the Second and Third Defendants were open about not being able to pay salaries but would say that they were waiting for cheques to come – he said it became like a script to the effect that the money would come at some point.
It is clear that at around this time, the First Defendant was facing significant financial difficulties. Much of the explanation for this says the Claimant, (in his witness statement) was that the Second and Third Defendants were “difficult people who did not know how to run a business” and that they “alienated so many customers and IBM salespeople over time [that] we lost a lot of our consultancy work and the consultants had their employment terminated.” Whilst, given the way in which matters developed overtime, leading to the Former Employees resigning from their employment with the First Defendant, the Claimant’s sentiments are understandable, it is to be noted that he had worked with both Defendants for many years, first as a freelance consultant and then, from May 2012, as an employee of NMQA, in the role of Principal Consultant.
The Claimant had also invested some of his own money in the First Defendant in the form of loans and had persuaded his father to do likewise. The Claimant loaned the sum of £95,000 to the First Defendant in 2016 and in October of that same year had persuaded his father to do likewise to the tune of $300,000. Both investments were initially in the form of loans but were later converted by agreement into shares at a point at which it became apparent that the First Defendant was not able to make appropriate repayments of the money that they had lent to it. Whilst the conversion of the loans to shares may, by the time that it occurred, have had an element of Hobson’s choice about it, the fact of long-standing employment coupled with personal investment would tend to suggest that the Claimant saw the First Defendant’s business as potentially viable and saw the Second and Third Defendant as individuals who were capable of making it so. In cross-examination, he accepted that, at the time that the loans were made by himself and his father, he believed that the First Defendant “had a good product and we could succeed.”
The Second Defendant, in his witness statement gave a detailed explanation of why he says that cash flow issues occurred in 2016 and into 2017, in particular due to the loss of the Green Hat business and substantial delays in payments from Jaguar Land Rover, which had represented “one of the largest single service deals in [the First Defendant’s] history”. He states that whilst these problems were “uncomfortable”, they were mitigated by steps taken by himself and the Third Defendants, including raising funds from investors and them selling their own shares in the business. They also took no salaries during this period. Mr Nesbit (the First Defendant’s COO) gave evidence that when salary defaults began to occur, he would keep a record (or “tracker”) in which he recorded the net amount owed to employees in each case and also recorded any amounts that were paid directly to them. He confirmed that neither of the Second or Third Defendants took any salary in 2018-19 – he said of them that they were making sacrifices (in terms of their salaries) and that he wanted, as far as he could, to ensure that the employees of the First Defendant got paid.
In the latter part of 2017, the First Defendant was able to secure investment funding through an investment company, Riverside Capital (“Riverside”), with a first tranche of funding in the sum of $1,000,000 being released in November 2017, at the point at which the First Defendant entered into an agreement with IBM under which it agreed to become a reseller of a software product of the First Defendant known as “Orson”. However, based on what is said by the Second Defendant in paragraphs 8-9.1 of his witness statement, the cashflow position deteriorated during the course of 2018 and into 2019. Without hopefully doing any injustice to the detail set out in the statement, the problems can be summarised as follows:
In Q1 of 2018, there was an $800,000 shortage in expected cashflow;
This meant that the First Defendant did not cross the revenue threshold which would have triggered the release of a further $500,000 from Riverside, which had the effect of producing an “expected cash” shortfall of $1,300,000;
The primary sales channel represented by Green Hat had come to an end due to the decision taken by IBM to outsource that work – this led to the First Defendant having to release its consultant team from employment;
Whilst the Second and Third Defendants were able to negotiate a further loan arrangement with Riverside in the sum of $1,000,000, this was only enough to “keep the business running and the team paid until September 2018”;
The Second and Third Defendant’s made substantial efforts to try to raise additional equity funding for the business but without material success;
The sales forecast based on the IBM/Orson agreement provided to be significantly over optimistic – expected sales over Q2-4 of 2018 had been set at $2.9m but actual sales amounted to less than $300,000;
The poor sales results in turn made it even more difficult to raise additional funds to support the business.
At paragraph 9.1.2, the Second Defendant describes the senior management team including himself, the Third Defendant and the Claimant, meeting in September 2018 to discuss he cashflow issues that the First Defendant was facing. He states that agreement was reached to the effect that senior individuals in the business, including the Claimant would “defer receiving payments as far as possible for the time being in order to prioritise paying the development team, the lowest earners and anyone who was in a vulnerable position. This included Alex Cardoso, David Aistrup and even Paolo Macinanti.” The statement goes on:
“From then on [the Third Defendant] liaised directly with every team member, via email, chat, calls or in person conversations to understand the needs of each person so that the smaller amounts of payments coming in to [the First Defendant] could be allocated where they were most needed to give the business and the employees the best chance of continuing as far as possible and as far as they wanted to……….[E]very attempt was made to get the required funds to these more vulnerable resources………
At no point did we guarantee that we would successfully complete an equity raise or close sufficient sales to ensure the business survived. The team knew the situation we were in from September 2018 onward. They had ample opportunity to resign, to choose another role etc. However, they all chose to continue, knowing that we could not guarantee regular and consistent payment within a specific timeframe.”
Turning to the question of pension payments, the Second Defendant’s evidence in his witness statement (at paragraph 9.3) notes that on 2 April 2014, Saif Qureshi, the First Defendant’s Office Manager, who was responsible for setting up the pensions programme, wrote to staff stating that a new pension scheme was being established but that in the meantime until it was set up, contributions would accrue. By July 2015, Ms Qureshi was writing to the Second and Third Defendants stating that “We are finally ready to launch the pension. The total to be paid is £58,047.73. Before I send this, I just want to check if we are good to go? I’m not sure how the payment dates work until I upload the payment file.” The following day, she wrote again stating “I have submitted the pensions. We have the option of paying on the 10th July (this Friday) shall I go for this date. Or would you prefer next week.” The Second Defendant replied to this email stating “ASAP please.”
The Second Defendant then states in his witness statement that
“Something must have held up the actual funding of the pensions at that point (July 2015) as the next communication we have on the subject is from Ed Nesbitt (COO) letting us know that auto-enrolment was due and should be completed within 3 months of that date. [The Third Defendant] responded to Ed saying: Yes, fund it them in 3 months” (sic).
Mr Nesbitt’s email also refers to the need to “clear up past pensions liabilities asap” and the Second Defendant’s email, addressing the auto-enrolment point only, says “Yes – defer it for the maximum three months.” The Second Defendant’s evidence is that “at that point we were waiting for the Riverside investment and OEM deal with IBM to go through and expected them both to have been completed comfortably within that 3-month window.” It is apparent that in fact this never happened, and it is now accepted by the Defendants that there is a collective pension shortfall of £76,985.96. In his witness statement Mr Nesbit stated that when he “became aware of the pension situation [he] began to track the amounts due with accrued interest. This information was then included in the Management Accounts. There was no intention to conceal this information. The expectation was that with the large enterprise deal that was nearing completion with Discover, all pensions would be funded.”
The Claimant’s evidence is that from around 2015 or thereabouts, wherever he asked the Second and Third Defendants about his pension, he would receive the answer that they were “working on it.” It was not until March 2019 that he says that he discovered that no pension had been set up for him and that no contributions had been paid into it. When he raised the matter with Mr Nesbitt (using one of the Slack channels), the discussion proceeded as follows:
“Mr Nesbit: This has been an ongoing discussion with Mark and David about getting that set up….and it is allocated in the [Riverside] VC funds
The Claimant: But so….like 5 years of it…..Sorry man, this is not against you….but D and M told me that this was set up. Do you mean that they never put any money in a pension fund for me?
Mr Nesbit: I know that since I took over this type of thing it has not happened and I am tracking…….I have all the data…….It is all run through payroll….. so you know it is all officially tracked……in the company’s books.
The Claimant: I’m not an accountant egghead, I just want my money
Mr Nesbit: Of course.”
It is perhaps unsurprising that, whilst the pensions issue might not have been the final straw for the Former Employees (with the exception of Mr Aistrup), their resignations in fact came shortly thereafter, when there was yet another non-payment of salary.
As to the funding of pension entitlements by the First Defendant, the position of Mr Aistrup was different to that of the other Former Employees in that he had agreed to top up his pension fund by way of salary sacrifice. This is relied on by the Claimant as evidence of concealment in relation to the position of the remaining Former Employees – in short, he suggests that as Mr Aistrup had opted for part of his salary to be paid by way of sacrifice into his pension fund, the Defendants had little option but to establish and pay into such a fund themselves – this they did in order to “cover their tracks”. As the remaining Former Employees had not done this, the true position of non-payment could be concealed from them. The Claimant’s evidence was that he was continually assured that money was going into the pension fund – he accepted that the First Defendant may have been keeping track on pension entitlements within its management accounts. Mr Nesbit gave evidence to the effect that he was responsible for tracking the pension payment shortfall once he became aware (at some point in 2017) that such payments were not in fact being made – he said that there was no intention to conceal that information and that the expectation was that once a particular deal had been completed by the First Defendant, “all pensions would be funded.” He also said that his understanding was that interest would also be paid on the late contributions. He said that he had trusted the Second and Third Defendants to resolve the issue but that this had not in fact come about. He accepted that the Former Employees (with the exception of Mr Aistrup) had been issued with payslips which indicated that pension contributions had been paid when in fact they had not.
It seems undoubtedly to be the case that the Former Employees did not take the holiday entitlements that had been granted to them under the terms of their contracts (and to which they were entitled in part under the terms of the Working Time Regulations 1998). The First and Second Defendants admit that holidays were not taken and that some payment is due in respect of this. The fact that the Former Employees were building up over a prolonged period, significant amounts of untaken holiday, is said by the Claimant to be illustrative of “a corporate and systemic failure”. The evidence of the Former Employees was that they were not permitted to take holiday – the Second Defendant disputed that this was the case and suggested that the Former Employees had willingly agreed to forgo holiday at times. Mr Macinanti’s evidence was that he was told at all times that if he was unable to take holiday because of work, his entitlement would carry over to the following year. He said that he did not recall seeing the Handbook which contained the provisions set out above.
The Claimant’s evidence (in cross-examination) was that he remembered being sent a PDF of the Handbook and being told to sign it but he was not sure that he had ever done so. He said that he was told on occasions that it did not apply to him. In his witness statement he said that on some occasions he was told that he could carry over unused holiday payments but on other occasions, he was told to “use it or lose it”. He said that the Second Defendant had assured him that if work was taking priority such that he could not take his holiday entitlement, it was agreed that he could carry it over. He said that he was clear in his understanding that he would be allowed to take holiday but if not, he would be compensated for days that he had not taken.
The Second Defendant’s evidence was to the effect that if particular holiday dates could not be granted “a formal process had to be gone through and approval given.” He suggested that all of the First Defendant’s employees, with one exception – Steve Richards – had signed to accept the terms of the new Handbook. I was not provided with any documentary evidence to support this having been done in the case of the Former Employees. He said however that he himself had never read the Handbook and that, whilst he was in general terms aware of the carry-over policy, he did not get this from the Handbook itself.
Reverting to the chronology and picking matters up on 26 April 2019, the Former Employees resigned from their employment with the First Defendant and brought proceedings in the Employment Tribunal as outlined above.
Up to the date of his departure, the Claimant had been the administrator of the First Defendant’s Slack account and of its Dropbox account. (There was a second Slack account which had been set up by Mr Macinanti but that account is not relevant to the issues in this claim.) On the day that he resigned from his employment, the Claimant deleted the First Defendant’s private Slack channels (that is those to which only the First Defendant’s staff had access). His evidence was that he deleted – or at least attempted to delete – only his own private messages which were contained in two of the private channels. One of the channels was with “former employees in the development team. The other was with David Aistrup and Dennis Mink”. His statement continues (at paragraph 69) as follows:
“Both channels were for general chatter about work. Neither contained commercially important information. In the latter channel, Dennis Mink did not leave the company with the rest of us so and so the Defendants could have seen those messages if they wanted.
………..
Anything that related to the Company’s products, such as code or technical information was kept in various online repositories, such as Dropbox or BitBucket and I handed over all the passwords in my possession to these repositories to the Company when I left. I did not keep or delete any of this data.”
He did however confirm in cross-examination, that Slack was used by Mr Macinanti for discussions with the product development team, including with Mary Johnstone, another IT specialist employed by the First Defendant – although he maintained that all of the relevant conversations were either still in place or could be retrieved using the Slack software administrator tools. He said that on the day of his departure, he had deleted conversations between the Former Employees on Slack which related to them resigning from the First Defendant. He said he had deleted “some private channels and maybe a couple of public channels in which [he] was a participant.” He maintained that there “was nothing of commercial value in them – all the First Defendant’s IP was in different tools which [he] handed over to them……Any [channels he] deleted were limited to [his] private conversations – nothing wider.”  He said that he had done this because he had lost confidence in the Second and Third Defendants and he did not want them to know what options he and the other Former Employees had been considering in relation to their departure. In addition, he accepted that, with hindsight, he should not have attempted to do what he did which was to delete the contents of the Slack channels to which he had contributed. He also accepted that it was in fact possible that he had deleted the entirety of the First Defendant’s Slack account – in other words, all of its channels, whether he was a contributor to them or not. He said however, that if this had happened, it had not been intentional and that his attempt (which may have failed) had been to delete a much smaller amount of material within the account. In any event, he maintained the position that nothing of value would have been lost as any information which had been deleted related to “commonly understood issues”.
Under cross-examination, Mr Macinanti accepted that Slack would have contained information relevant to the First Defendant’s products which were under development. In re-examination, he confirmed that Slack was used for technical discussions rather than business ones and confirmed that it was used for product development.
The evidence presented on behalf of the Defendants presented in their witness statements, presented a rather different picture. In his witness statement, the Second Defendant suggested that the Claimant had “deliberately and consciously deleted all date, irretrievably from all private Slack channels…The data he deleted stretched back over several years and was of significant business value.”
The Defendants also relied on the evidence of Mary Johnston.  Her evidence was that she had been using Slack to communicate with other employees and management over a period of 9 years or so and that she had used it for the purposes of sharing documents with colleagues. She went on to say this:
“In private Slack channels I also had discussions with the ORSON development team. These discussions included recommended changes, testing of new builds, defects detected during testing, prioritisation of new features, and bug fixes, future releases and schedules, questions about how software performed and work arounds for known issues. I would bookmark the critical conversations so that I could return to the developer’s specific advice as needed. Slack private channels served as my knowledge base for storing advice and information from the development team.”
She said that Slack was the only software tool that she used in the course of her product development work – she did not use any of the other options (Dropbox etc) which might have been available. She said that after the Claimant had gone, she had lost all of the data that she had had on Slack.
Mr Nesbit also confirmed in his evidence that he had found that all private channels on Slack had been deleted following the resignations of the Former Employees.
Returning to the evidence of the Second Defendant, he states that the effect of the Claimant deleting all of the private Slack channels was that a significant amount of work was irretrievably lost and that new product protypes and design details had to be re-created effectively from scratch. He then goes on to suggest that this caused significant delays in bringing a new product – ‘Test Data Extractor’ – to market with knock on consequences in terms of delayed sales and loss of maintenance payments related to the use of the product. He assessment the total losses due to what he says was a deliberate act of destruction by the Claimant as being $441,939 as the product was one year late in coming to market.
During the course of the trial itself, evidence emerged to the effect that the First Defendant’s assets had been sold to a company known as Apica AB, a company registered in Sweden. The Claimant suggests that this was done in an attempt to put the assets of the First Defendant out of the reach of the Claimant. The Second Defendant disputed this and suggested that under the terms of the sale agreement, which had effectively been forced on him by Riverside as the best option available to the indebted First Defendant, a sum of $360,000 had been set aside in order to satisfy any potential award of damages and costs to the Claimant. When cross-examined on this point, the Second Defendant stated that:
“….our primary concern was to address the liability of this claim – we did not consider a deal [for the sale of the First Defendant] until this was sorted – everything else was secondary…..I refused to do a deal until the principles relating to the allocation of funds to meet the liabilities and settlement of this claim had been agreed….In the end, the only other option was liquidation which would hugely reduce the value of [the First Defendant]. There was no other way to get a contribution towards these proceedings – it was an excellent deal and the only way forward for the First Defendant.”
More generally in relation to his duties as a director, the Second Defendant confirmed that he was fully aware of the need to act in good faith. He said that it was always the intention that pension payments would be funded but that this had had to be deferred due to cash flow issues – in short “the cash was not available to fund the pensions”. He had used his own money – in the form of the proceeds of sale of shares – to fund the running of the company rather than for what it had been intended, namely addressing his significant health problems. He said that he was not aware that employees had been receiving pay slips which suggested that pension contributions had been paid but that those contributions would have been paid if funding had come in. He said that the issue of funding (or lack of it) had come up at various points in 2015, 2016 and 2017 but that there were always cashflow problems within the First Defendant. He denied that there was any deliberate concealment of this issue, albeit that he suggested that pensions funding was more within the remit of the Third Defendant than his own.
He said that throughout the period of financial difficulty, he was “confident that we would get investment…a number of funders had indicated a serious level of interest.” He said that the Defendants had “gone to great lengths” to ensure that the Former Employees were kept aware of the financial position. He did not believe that the First Defendant had reached the point of insolvency because they were continually looking at alternative sources of funding. He said that:
“we were managing a shifting situation and we agreed to prioritise the employees…We communicated with them on a weekly basis to ensure that they were in the best place that they could be….We were fully occupied trying to address the situation…..We agreed to prioritise the most vulnerable – we were making nuanced decisions on a month by month basis.”
The Issues
Issue (1) What sums were due to be paid, but were not paid and have not been paid to each of the Former Employees pursuant to their contracts of employment and/or any relevant statutory obligation?
As far as pension payments are concerned, it has been accepted by the First and Second Defendants that the unpaid entitlements (subject to any defences advanced by them) amount to £76,985.96 across all of the Former Employees. It is also agreed, subject to the First Defendant’s set-off defence, that the Claimant is entitled to repayment of expenses in the sum of £29,096.28. The remaining items are not agreed as set out below.
Dealing first with the Claimant himself, in his Closing Submissions on behalf of the First and Second Defendants, Mr Innes accepts that the following sums have not been paid to the Claimant:
Salary of £31,892.44 – as against the figure of £63,333.33 claimed by the Claimant. The figure claimed by the Claimant is said to amount to 8 months’ salary. Given that at the material time, his salary was £95,000 per annum, the sum that he has claimed must be a gross sum. His loss is in fact the net sum that he would have received, albeit that that sum may need to be grossed up to address any tax liability that he might now face as a result of any judgment in his favour. Given that his net monthly pay was £5,259.68, it would suggest that his loss (before any grossing up) is £42,077.44. Whilst it appears to be accepted that he was paid the sum of £10,185, this had been deducted from the figure applied to expenses, with the effect that the net sum of £42,077.44 is owed;
Holiday pay of £5,240.08 as against the figure of £33,442.92 claimed by the Claimant (based on 84.5 days). This was on the basis that the provisions of the Employee Handbook applied and that allowed for a maximum of 5 days to be carried over with the possibility of a further 5 in the event that specific permission was given. As to this, I am not satisfied on the evidence I have heard, that the Claimant ever accepted the terms of the Employee Handbook. Even if he had, it seems to me that he was given assurances by the Defendants that, whatever the provisions of that Handbook, he would be compensated for holidays that he had not been able to take. Whether those assurances amounted to a waiver by the First Defendant or some form of estoppel, does not in my view matter very much. The fact is that the Claimant was not taking holidays as he was devoting himself to trying to make a success of the First Defendant’s business. He travelled extensively and without a break (which is how he came to incur many of the expenses for which he claims reimbursement) – it would be wholly unjust if he were not now compensated for the holidays which he had not been able to take. In the absence of figure being put forward by the Defendants (apart from one based on the terms contained in the Employee Handbook) I assess the loss under this head as claimed by the Claimant -  £33,442.92. However, this would again appear to be based on gross salary. Netting that figure down produces a figure of £22,222.15;
Interest on loans – this was claimed in the sum of £4,320.21 but was “not admitted” by the Defendants. No serious objection to this claim has been put forward by the First and Second Defendants save that the point has been made that one would need to ensure that there was no double counting based or any award of statutory interest made as part of this judgment. The sum represents interest on loans for the benefit of the First Defendant and I am satisfied that the Claimant is entitled to recover interest payments that he was obliged to make.
As far as Mr Aistrup was concerned:
Salary - it was admitted that 2.21 months’ salary was owed but that the figure of £10,500 was very slightly over what was due as a gross figure (£10,497.50) and that in any this was subject to a reduction for tax and that his monthly pay was £3,398.39. This produces a net loss of £7,510.44;
Holiday pay – this was admitted to the extent of £3,144.05, as against the figure claimed of £7,125 (based on 30 days). Again, the amount claimed appears to be based on gross figures – the net figure for 30 days on my calculations is £5,097.58.
Turning to Mr Cardoso:
Salary – In its Defence, the First Defendant accepted that 2.1 months was owed amounting to £8,339.98 gross as against the figure claimed of £16,000 based on 4 months’ salary (claimed as a gross figure). However, based on the spreadsheet of payments produced by the Defendants, it appears to be accepted that 7 months’ salary was due in respect of which partial payments totalling £12,577 had been paid. Given that his net salary for 7 months would have been 7 x £2,988.14 - £20,916.98, his net loss, taking account of the payments that were made direct to him (without any apparent deduction for tax) is £8,339.98;
Holiday pay – this was accepted to the figure of £2,647.62 as against a claim of £3,000 (based on 15 days). The figure of £3,000 claimed appears to be a gross sum – netting this down by 25.29% (as set out in the First and Second Defendant’s closing submissions) produces a net loss of £2,241.30;
Mr Macinanti:
Salary – this is accepted by the Defendants in their Defence up to the value of £16,037.76 gross based on 2 months’ salary as against a figure of £27,708.23 based on 3.5 months’ gross salary claimed by the Claimant. However, again based on the schedule of payments produced by the Defendants at trial, it would appear that his salary was not paid over a period of 7 months but that he did receive a number of payments into his account to a total of £20,780. Given that these payments are shown as having gone directly into Mr Macinanti’s bank account, it would appear that no deduction for tax was made in respect of them. That being so, his net loss referable to a 7-month period would appear to be £36,817.76 (7 x £5259.68). Then taking into account the payments of £20,780 paid directly to him, this leaves a shortfall of £16,037.76;
Holiday pay – accepted in the sum of £5,240.08 against a claim for £5,937.50 (based on 15 days). Given that the sum claimed is referable to a period of 15 days, it must be a gross sum. Netting it down by 33.56% produces a net loss of £3,944.87.
And finally Mr Sousa:
Salary – this has been accepted by the Defendants in their Defence in the gross sum of £16,051.98 as against the sum of £20,000 claimed as being 4 months’ loss of salary. However, based again on a shortfall referable to 7 months and setting off partial payments shown to have reached Mr Sousa’s bank account, he has received a total of £8,925 against a net figure which he should have received of 7 x £3,568.14 = £24,976.98. There is therefore a net shortfall of £16,051.98;
Holiday pay – this is accepted in the Defence in the sum of £3,309.52 as against a claim for £3,750 (based on 15 days). Again, however, this appears to be a gross figure – which computes to a net loss of £2,676.37.
For avoidance of doubt, the figures set out in bold in the above paragraphs, represent the amounts that have not been paid to the Former Employees and which the Claimant is entitled to claim in these proceedings, subject of course to the answers to the remaining issues addressed below. The total of those sums is £130,519.67 to which needs to be added the pension contributions which the Defendants accept have not been paid and which amount to £76,985.96 and the sum of £29,096.28 in respect of the Claimant’s unpaid expenses. The total of all of these figures therefore comes to £236,601.91. Questions however arise as to the tax treatment of the various components which go to make up that figure and I will address those below.
Issue (2) Have the claims arising out of any alleged sums being assigned to the Claimant?
In his closing submissions, Mr Innes accepted that evidence of assignment to the Claimant had been provided in the form of deeds entered into by the Assignors. It was also accepted that written notice of this had been given to the First Defendant. As far as the Second Defendant was concerned, it was said that the letter relied on as providing notice of assignment (from the Claimant’s solicitors dated 8 September 2021, had not been addressed to him but only to the First and Third Defendants. On that basis, there could, said Mr Innes, only have been an equitable assignment to the Claimant of those claims that were brought against him. However, given that there was no reasonable likelihood of the Assignors bringing separate proceedings against him (not least because they had (with the exception of Mr Aistrup) given evidence in the trial), Mr Innes accepted that it may be appropriate for the court to dispense with the usual rule that, in the case of an equitable assignment, the assignor would normally need to be joined by the assignee as a party to the proceedings. As to that, I agree and therefore dispense with that procedural requirement.
Issue (3) Did any of the former employees waive any right to any sum which was otherwise due to them, and can the Defendants rely upon any such waiver?
As set out above, I do not accept the preliminary point made by Ms Grossman to the effect that any claim based on waiver, falls at the first hurdle due to the provisions of section 13(1) ERA.
The Claimant asserts that the Defendants cannot succeed in a case based on variation of the contracts of employment of the Former Employees due to “non-compliance with the variation provisions stipulated in each of [their] contracts” (as set out in the Unilateral Variation Clause). It is also said that any variation would need to be certain as to its ambit and duration and that this was not present. The Claimant also suggests that no consideration was provided by the First Defendant for any such variation.
As to any possible election, the Claimant suggests that there was none as the Former Employees had not made a clear choice between two alternative and inconsistent courses of action.
Ms Grossman’s case on behalf of the Claimant with regard to waiver by promissory estoppel was that the necessary elements for such an estoppel were not present in that the Former Employee had made no unequivocal promise or representation to give up their contractual rights and forgo sums that were otherwise due and owing to them – at its highest, all that could be said was that, in the face of the First Defendant’s apparent financial difficulties, they had adopted a “wait and see” approach to what was an evolving situation. It is also said that there was no evidence of any reliance by the First Defendant on any relevant conduct of the Former Employees. Finally, on this point, Ms Grossman submits that it would in any event be wholly inequitable for the Defendants to rely on the doctrine given the misrepresentation of the position regarding pension payments and the inconsistency of the Defendants’ messages about funds coming in to the First Defendant.
In response, Mr Innes suggests that, even if taken at its highest, the Unilateral Variation Clause does not operate so as to exclude a waiver by an employee of his contractual rights or an estoppel.
He suggests that his waiver/estoppel arguments are founded on the following propositions (set out at paragraph 15 of his Closing Submissions):
the Former Employees were made aware and kept informed of the First  Defendant’s financial difficulties;
the Former Employees were given the option of leaving;
by their actions, they elected to continue to work for the First Defendant in the knowledge that it could not pay their salaries (as they fell due) and that there was a risk that it would never be able to do so;
“accordingly, they represented that they would continue to work for the [First Defendant] and they would defer and/or forego their salaries and would not claim any contractual right to the same”;
the First Defendant “reasonably relied on their conduct to its detriment in that it agreed to continue to trade and to employ them rather than take steps to liquidate and terminate their employment.”
Mr Innes goes on to suggest that propositions (1)-(3) cannot sensibly be challenged and that proposition (5) has not been challenged in that the First Defendant clearly did continue employing the Former Employees.
As to proposition (4), Mr Innes appeared to accept that this was a case in which any representation arose as a matter of conduct rather than by express words. He also candidly accepted that it could not realistically be maintained that the Former Employees had agreed to forego their salaries entirely but “more plausibly” it was a case in which they had elected to defer payment of their salaries “unless and until the [First Defendant] was in a financial position to pay them, which did not occur.”
On the evidence that I have seen and heard, I am not satisfied that the Former Employees can properly be regarded as having varied their contracts of employment or waived any entitlement to any of the sums which were prima facie owing to them and which are now claimed by the Claimant in his own right and as assignee of the claims of his former colleagues. Whilst it is right that all of the Former Employees continued to work for the First Defendant during a period of significant financial uncertainty and without their contractual payments having been met in full, I do not think that they can properly be regarded as having given up their rights to such payments in any of the ways for which the Defendants contend. There was neither waiver, nor election nor any form of estoppel pursuant to which they agreed that the First Defendant should be released from its contractual obligations. At best, they did no more than give the First Defendant additional time to pay them, based on the warm words from the Second and Third Defendants to the effect that investment was on its way and would come soon. They may therefore be regarded as having agreed to some form of deferral of payment but once it became clear to them that they were not going to be paid as promised, they were entitled to resign from their employment and bring proceedings to recover that which had not been properly paid to them.
All of this reasoning is equally applicable in relation to outstanding holiday payments. I am satisfied that holidays were not taken and that, whatever the provisions of the Handbook, the Former Employees were given to understand that their entitlements to holiday would be allowed to roll over. To the extent that holiday had not been taken up to the point at which they all resigned, they are entitled to payment in lieu and did not waive any entitlement – for the same reasons that apply to their outstanding salary.
In so far as pension contributions are concerned, the same principles apply but with the additional feature that the Former Employees were all issued with pay slips which recorded pension contributions as having been made by the First Defendant when (with the exception of Mr Aistrup), this had not in fact happened. It is to my mind impossible to argue that those affected had in any way waived their entitlement to sums which on the face of the payslips, had in fact been paid.
Issue (4) When each of the Second and Third Defendants were not registered directors at Companies House, did either of them continue to be a de facto director and therefore continue to owe obligations pursuant to the Companies Act 2006?
As far as the Second Defendant is concerned, this ceased to be an issue as, at paragraph 20 of his Skeleton Argument dated 18 October 2024, Mr Innes on his behalf accepted that he was indeed a de facto director at all material times and therefore owed the duties set out in sections 172 and 174 CA.
As far as the Third Defendant is concerned, I do not think that there is any basis on which to reach any different conclusion to that which has been accepted by the Second Defendant by way of concession. Whilst his particular role within the Frist Defendant may have differed from that of the Second Defendant (in that they had different areas of responsibility within the business), they operated as the controlling directors of the company at all times – when they were statutory directors and also during those periods in which they ran the business but were not registered in name at Companies House.
Issue (5) Did the Second Defendant or the Third Defendant breach those obligations?
Although expressed as a distinct issue, separate from Issue (7) below, it seems to me that the answer to this question is provided by the outcome of the analysis below under that separate issue. I do not understand there to be any free-standing points that require to be determined under Issue (5) which are not addressed under the rubric of Issue (7) and the written submissions provided by both counsel do not appear to draw any such distinction. It might be said that Issue (5) is limited to the narrow question of whether the Second and Third Defendants breached the obligations that they owed to the First Defendant under sections 172 and 174 CA and that such breaches would not necessarily be co-terminous with the answer to the question of personal liability addressed under Issue (7). However, whilst that might be a theoretical possibility, I do not think it is helpful to try and address the issue of personal liability by potentially dividing the issues up in this way and for that reason, I will address, under Issue (7), any relevant considerations that flow from the obligations owed by the Second and Third Defendants under the CA.
Issue (6) Is the First Defendant liable for sums owed to the Former Employees and if so, in what amounts?
Again, the answer to this issue is determined as a consequence of the analysis relating to other issues in the case, in particular in this instance by Issue (1), where I have addressed those sums which should have been paid to the Former Employees and Issue (3), where I have dealt with the question of whether any of them have waived any entitlement to receive such sums.
Issue (7) Are the Second Defendant and/or the Third Defendant personally liable for the sums (or any part of them) which in breach of contract have not been paid to the Former Employees?
The Claimant asserts that the Second and Third Defendants are so liable. In particular, it is said that their actions were not carried out in good faith in that they had misled the Former Employees with regard to the pension payments and that the fact that Mr Aistrup had been treated differently with regard to his pension contributions (because he had opted for a salary sacrifice arrangement) was indicative of deliberate concealment of the true position.
As far as salary was concerned, there was, said the Claimant “a very considerable lack of transparency in what the Second and Third Defendants had told the Former Employees.”
On this point, it is worth reflecting back on the outline legal position. In outline terms, a limited company is one which has a separate legal identity from its owners and directors. Neither the directors nor owners will generally be liable in respect of its contractual debts or losses. Whilst directors will owe duties to a company (as set out in sections 172 and 174 Companies Act), they will not generally owe similar duties to any other parties, including employees or creditors. The protected position of directors is reflected in the rule in Said v Butt – if directors act properly in the interests of a company and do so in order to promote its success, they will not be liable in tort for having procured a breach of contract by that company where, for example, it fails to pay its creditors or employees. If that were the case, one would routinely see litigation succeeding against individual Defendant directors in circumstances in which a company had run up debts to such an extent that it had become insolvent. Something more is required and one of the routes by which individual liability can arise is if a director has acted in breach of his or her duties owed under the relevant sections of the CA. However, in considering that issue, the focus is very much, at least as a starting point, on the director’s actions and intentions as regards the company itself and not as regards a third party that may be affected by the company’s failure to meet its contractual obligations. In short, it is a breach of the duties owed to the company which provides the gateway to personal liability to the third party. Whilst it is of course, correct that in fulfilling the duty to act in good faith to promote the success of a company includes, under section 172, a requirement to have regard to the interests of that company’s employees, this is not to be elevated into an obligation, without more, to ensure that, for example, employees are paid on time so that the company is seen to meet its contractual obligations towards those employees. The stark examples set out in the judgment of Lane J in Antuzis are helpful in understanding the difference – the director that causes a company to ‘rob Peter to pay Paul’ in circumstances of financial difficulty, will not generally and without more,  be regarded as acting in breach of the duties that he owes to that company. Contrast that with the director who knowingly and dishonestly supplies a counterfeit product to its customers with a wholesale disregard for the fact that this will ultimately leave the company’s reputation in tatters – that director does not act in the best interests of that company and therefore exposes himself to personal liability. The facts of Antuzis itself provide another graphic example of the circumstances in which personal liability may arise – the directors were knowingly falsifying the employment records of vulnerable employees whose wages were subject to statutory protection and were doing so in order simply to line their own pockets as the beneficiaries of dishonestly inflated company profits.
The facts of the present case are in my view, a considerable distance from those particular examples where a breach of duty to the company can be identified. In my view, it is clear from the evidence that the Second and Third Defendants had a vested interest in the First Defendant succeeding and that, when faced with financial problems, they attempted as best they could, to address this by seeking out further outside investment.  Whilst they continually gave assurances to the Former Employees that they would be paid at some point, I do not accept that this could be said to be a breach of the duties that they owed to the First Defendant – I have no doubt that both the Second and Third Defendants wanted the First Defendant to succeed and had an active interest in it doing so. The assurances that they gave to the Former Employees were designed to persuade them to remain in employment rather than leaving with the effect of putting the First Defendant in an even more precarious position. Even if imperfect business decisions were made (as to which I make no express finding), they were made in the hope that it would help the First Defendant to survive and thrive.
There is arguably a different position with regard to pension payments where the evidence indicates not that these were the subject of the same assurances given in relation to outstanding salary payments but rather that the relevant contributions had in fact been being made on behalf of all of the Former Employees, not just Mr Aistrup. Even here however, I am not satisfied that the evidence is sufficient to demonstrate that the Second and Third Defendants were not acting in the best interests of the First Defendant. Given that Mr Nesbit was tracking the contributions that had not in fact been made – and given that his understanding was that the intention ultimately was to pay them with interest added – this appears to me to be another example of the First Defendant simply not having the funds to meet its contractual liabilities due to the financial problems that it was facing.
As far as holiday pay was concerned, I proceed on the basis that there was agreement between the First Defendant and the Former Employees to the effect that they would be allowed to ‘roll over’ their holiday entitlement. There was therefore no immediate right to holiday pay up to the date of their resignation – their claims are not for holiday that was taken but for which they were not paid – rather they are for payment in lieu arising at the date on which they resigned. Whilst the outstanding amounts were clearly not paid on the date that they left the employment  of the First Defendant, I do not think that it can sensibly be said that the Second or Third Defendants induced or procured any breach of contract in respect of the non-payment, still less that it can be said that they acted in breach of the duties that they owed to the First Defendant.
The same reasoning applies to the Claimant’s claim for expenses – he was entitled to repayment of expenses incurred in the course of his employment. No particular date for payment is relied on by him save that he should have been reimbursed at the latest on the final day of his employment. This then leaves this part of his claim in materially the same position as the claims for holiday pay to which I have referred above.
Issue (9) Did the Claimant cause information to be lost to the First Defendant which was commercially viable to it? Did the Claimant deliberately take actions to cause loss and damage to the First Defendant?
The allegation made on behalf of the First and Second Defendants is that the Claimant deliberately deleted information belonging to the First Defendant and which was useful to it – in short, he had deliberately deleted or destroyed the First Defendant’s confidential information and did so in a way that “made the data unrecoverable…in relation to the Company’s’ new product components and design.” (see paragraph 24.2 of the Defendants’ Defence.)
If that is what happened, Mr Innes argues that this would plainly amount to a breach of the implied term. However, on the evidence that I have heard, I am not satisfied that he did this – I do not believe that he deliberately deleted the First Defendant’s confidential information or deliberately caused the problems with taking its product to market as described by Ms Johnston and the Second Defendant in their evidence. I accept the Claimant’s evidence that his intention went no further than seeking to delete conversations between himself and the other Former Employees regarding their potential resignation from the First Defendant. Whilst it might be argued that even that information – being created during the course of employment, using its software – is information which is owned by the First Defendant and was deliberately destroyed by the Claimant, I do not see that this will have caused any loss to it. Therefore, whilst I accept that the Claimant must, in the course of attempting to delete information relating to his departure from employment, have inadvertently caused the deletion of material contained more widely within the First Defendant’s Slack channels, I do not accept that he deliberately took any action to cause loss and damage to it.
Issue (10) If so, was that loss in breach of a duty owed to the First Defendant?
Given my conclusions in relation to Issue (9), this issue does not fall for consideration.
Issue (11) What loss was caused (pursuant to the usual principles of causation) to the First Defendant? What quantum of any alleged loss can be proved?
Again, based on my conclusions in relation to Issue (9), this issue does not arise. Had I found that the Claimant had deliberately gone about damaging the First Defendant’s business, I would have been prepared to proceed on the basis that this may have caused loss and damage to it. However, whilst the Second Defendant did seek to advance a basis on which damages might be calculated, it seems to me that this had what one might call a ‘back of an envelope’ quality about it and did not in my view provide sufficient evidential foundation on which to calculate any particular identifiable loss which may have flowed from the loss of any material which had been on the Slack system but which was no longer there after the Claimant had left his employment with the First Defendant.
Interest on amounts due to the Claimant
I am satisfied that the Claimant is entitled to statutory interest on the amounts that I have identified above as owing. A rate of 8% is excessive however, particularly during an era of relatively low commercial interest rates. In those circumstances, it seems to me that a rate of 3% is appropriate.
Tax treatment of the amounts due to Claimant
There are broadly speaking, six categories of loss on which the Claimant has succeeded, and it will be necessary to determine the extent to which any of those categories will need to be grossed up to meet any tax liability that he has. Those categories – and my very much provisional views in relation to them – are as follows:
Pension contributions relating to the Claimant himself – as to which it may well be that grossing up will need to be applied;
Pension contributions relating to the Assignors – as to this, the loss that the Claimant has recovered flows on the face of it from the fact of the assignments that he entered into, with the consequence that it does not appear to be an emolument from his own employment in respect of which he is liable to be taxed. If that is right, there would be no requirement for any grossing up;
Salary and holiday payments relating to the Claimant – again, this may need to be grossed up;
Salary and holiday payments relating to the Assignors – subject to further submissions from the parties – the same reasoning would apply here as in relation to the pension payments referrable to the Assignors, with the consequence that these sums would not need to be grossed up;
The Claimant’s own expenses – if, as appears to be the case, this is simple reimbursement of expenses incurred in the course of his employment, then it would not appear to be an emolument from employment and therefore would not potentially be subject to any grossing up;
Interest on loans – again, this does not appear to have the character of an emolument and if so, would not need to be grossed up as it would not be taxable in the hands of the Claimant.
I have not heard submissions from the parties which address the points which I have set out and, as Ms Grossman has properly noted in her written submissions on quantum, any grossing up exercise is dependent on the broader findings that I have only now made in relation to the various heads of claim pursued by the Claimant. I will therefore give the parties a period of 21 days from the date on which this judgment is handed down, to attempt to agree the methodology and calculation of the final award to be made to the Claimant having regard to any tax consequences that flow from this. On the assumption that this can be done, then the parties should also submit an agreed draft Order. If, on the expiry of that 21 day period, an agreed figure has not been reached, I will then allow the parties a further period of 14 days to provide written submissions on the tax consequences of the findings that I have made and as to the final figure that should be recorded in the judgment as payable to the Claimant by the First Defendant.

.............................
Lord Justice Dingemans:
Introduction and issues
This is the hearing of an appeal by Graham Darby, who is a 50 year old man of previous good character and who was a cryptocurrency trader, against his committal to prison for contempt of court on 24 July 2024.
It is now common ground that Mr Darby acted in contempt of court by failing to disclose assets of 100 Bitcoin pursuant to a disclosure order made under a freezing order dated 2 August 2021.  The 100 Bitcoin had an estimated value of about US $4 million at the time of the committal, and was worth about US $10 million at the date of the hearing of the appeal on 16 January 2025.
Mr Darby was committed to 18 months imprisonment on 24 July 2024 by His Honour Judge Keyser KC, sitting as a Judge of the High Court (the judge) in the Circuit Commercial Court of the Business and Property Courts in Wales.  The judge said that six months was the punitive aspect of the sentence and 12 months represented the part that might be set aside if Mr Darby purged his contempt.
During the committal proceedings Mr Darby, who had been represented earlier in the proceedings, was unrepresented.  Mr Darby was unrepresented at the adjourned sanctions hearing, although it appears that Mr Darby had been attempting to get legal representation for that hearing.  The fact that the sanctions hearing took place without an adjournment, in circumstances when Mr Darby was unrepresented after he had attempted to get solicitors to represent him, formed the main ground of appeal.
Mr Darby had an appeal as of right, but it appears that after his committal to prison he suffered a form of breakdown. It was only with the assistance of his daughter that Janes Solicitors were instructed with the benefit of legal aid to act on his behalf.
An appeal was made to this court.  By an order sealed on 13 December 2024, Males LJ ordered that Mr Darby, who had then served 146 days imprisonment (some 4 months and 24 days, which is equivalent to a sentence of over 9 months), should be released on bail.  At the conclusion of the hearing on 16 January 2024 judgment was reserved, and Mr Darby’s bail was extended.
By letter dated 14 January 2024, sent just before the hearing of the appeal on 16 January 2024, Janes solicitors wrote serving an amended psychiatric report on Mr Darby dated 14 January 2025 from Dr Ajat Sanikop, a consultant in forensic psychiatry (the psychiatric report).  The letter also recorded that Mr Darby, with the benefit of legal advice, accepted that he was in contempt of court, and apologised for his contempt of court.  These new materials were relied on in support of the grounds challenging the length of the sentence and whether it should have been suspended.  After the hearing Helen Pugh, counsel for Mr Darby, and Daniel Scott, counsel for Mr Wang, produced a helpful note outlining the ways in which the fresh materials might be taken into account by the court hearing an appeal from an order committing a person to imprisonment.
The court heard oral submissions from Ms Pugh and Mr Scott at the hearing of the appeal.  By the conclusion of the hearing, it was apparent that the issues to be addressed by this court were: (1) whether the judge should have adjourned the sanctions hearing on 24 July 2024 in light of the fact that Mr Darby was unrepresented and said that he had been trying to obtain lawyers to represent him; (2) whether the sentence of immediate committal to prison was wrong, because any sentence should have been suspended; (3) whether the sentence was too long; and (4) whether, in light of the letter dated 14 January 2025 showing that Mr Darby had apologised for his contempt of court, or the psychiatric report, the sentence ought to be reduced or suspended.
After the hearing, and while this judgment was being prepared, Curzon Green, solicitors for Mr Wang, wrote a letter dated 28 January 2025 (but misdated 28 February 2025) stating the parties had agreed an overall settlement, and that in the circumstances the appeal against the order committing Mr Darby to prison was not opposed and that a reduction of sentence to six months would not be opposed.  A draft consent order dealing with the discharge of the freezing orders and consequential matters in the Cardiff Circuit Commercial Court was attached.
These further developments mean that the issue now is whether the appeal should be allowed, so that the sentence be reduced to one of time served.
The factual background
Given the recent developments, the background can be summarised briefly.  There was a dispute between Mr Wang, an Australian cryptocurrency trader who was aged about 22 at the material time, and Mr Darby over a swap of crypto-currencies involving Tezos and Bitcoin pursuant to contracts made between them.  Mr Wang’s case was that Mr Darby had agreed to take 400,000 Tezos for the purposes of stake “bonding” and “baking”.
The evidence showed that “baking” was not dissimilar to “mining” for Bitcoin.  Mr Wang’s case was that Mr Darby did not return the Tezos at the end of the transaction.  Mr Darby’s case had been that all obligations had been discharged and that Mr Wang felt he had done less well out of the transaction.
The proceedings
The proceedings by Mr Wang against Mr Darby started on 2 August 2021 when a without notice freezing order was granted.  This freezing order contained standard provisions about disclosing assets by letter, later verified by a statement of truth.
Mr Darby did not disclose the existence of 100 Bitcoin.  These 100 Bitcoin had been identified in expert evidence by Richard Sanders of CipherBlade, a blockchain and cybercrime investigative firm.  He had, from other information, identified from public ledgers 100 Bitcoin which was likely to belong to Mr Darby, but he needed further information from Mr Darby to confirm it.
Mr Darby denied that he owned the Bitcoin, contending that he had poor memory, had put all his wallets into a hard drive and forgotten the password, but he did disclose some other transactions.  As a result of this information Mr Sanders produced a further report in which, having taken account of the transactions which Mr Darby had disclosed, he reported that his confidence that the 100 Bitcoin belonged to Mr Darby had increased.
In the interim Mr Darby had applied for security for costs and failed, and was ordered to pay £30,000 for the costs of that application.  He failed to pay.  An order was made ordering him to pay failing which his defence would be struck out.  Again Mr Darby did not pay, and the defence was struck out.  His solicitors came off the record.  Damages were assessed.
The contempt proceedings
Contempt proceedings were commenced in respect of the failure to disclose the existence of the 100 Bitcoin.  The new form of Part 81 application was used.  That gave notice to Mr Darby of his right to obtain legal aid.  It is apparent, from the medical evidence and the psychiatric report, that Mr Darby has had problems with his memory, which are very likely to have been related to his mental state and the pressure of court proceedings.  It is fair to record that Mr Darby has not coped well with these proceedings.
After various adjournments, there was a hearing to determine whether the contempts were proved.  Mr Darby did not attend.  The judge found that Mr Darby: (1) breached paragraph 13(1) of a freezing order dated 2 August 2021 requiring Mr Darby to disclose all his assets worldwide exceeding £5,000 in value, including a complete inventory of his cryptocurrency holdings.  Mr Darby had 100 Bitcoin which were worth in August 2021 approximately $US 4 million; (2) breached paragraph 14 of the same order dated 2 August 2021 requiring Mr Darby to provide Mr Wang’s solicitors with a witness statement, supported by a statement of truth, verifying the information set out pursuant to paragraph 13(1) of the order.  Again Mr Darby failed to disclose the existence of the Bitcoin; and (3) made a false statement to the effect that the contents of the disclosure letter dated 11 August 2021 were true and accurate, when they were false because he had failed to disclose his 100 Bitcoin and because he said he was unable to access his Bitcoin because he had forgotten his password and he had mental health problems which had caused him to forget.
There was a directions hearing providing for a separate hearing for sanctions.  Mr Darby finally attended at this hearing, and disclosed that he had attempted, unsuccessfully, to instruct solicitors.  The judge found that Mr Darby had put his head in the sand.  The hearing proceeded and the sanction was imposed.
Appeal allowed
In the light of the fact that Mr Darby has, albeit belatedly, complied with the court’s orders and apologised, I would allow the appeal, and reduce the sanction on Mr Darby to a committal to prison for the equivalent of time served.  He has served 146 days which is equivalent to a committal to prison of 292 days (a period of over 9 months).
That means that it is not necessary to determine the other grounds of appeal.  It might be said, however, that if a person is facing a sanction of committal to prison for contempt of court and that person belatedly engages with the court process, there are many reasons to grant a short adjournment to ensure that the person in contempt has the benefit of legal representation.  This ensures fairness to that person, in circumstances where many contemnors only come to their senses at the 11th hour and 59th minute, see generally Haringey London Borough Council v Brown [2015] EWCA Civ 483; [2017] 1 WLR 542 at paragraphs 41 to 44.  In many cases this will also be to the advantage of the side seeking the order for committal.  This is because the contemnor’s legal representatives are likely to have more success in persuading the contemnor to purge his contempt and comply with court orders.  That will also assist the court in ensuring that there is compliance (albeit on a belated basis) with its orders.
Conclusion
For the detailed reasons set out above I would allow the appeal to the extent of reducing the sanction on Mr Darby to a committal to prison for the time served, being 146 days, which is a sentence of 292 days.

JUDGE SCHERBEL-BALL
Between
JUNIOR HUNTER
Appellant
and
REGISTRAR OF APPROVED DRIVING INSTRUCTORS
Respondent
Decision: The appeal is allowed but no further trainee licence is granted.
REASONS
This appeal concerns a decision of the Registrar of Approved Driving Instructors (“the Registrar”) made on 28 May 2024 to refuse to grant the Appellant a second trainee licence.
The Appellant is a trainee driving instructor who was granted a trainee licence under section 129 of the Road Traffic Act 1988 (the “Act”), for a six-month period from 30 October 2023 to 29 April 2024. On a date which is not clear from the papers (because the Registrar inaccurately describes it as 19 October 2024), but which predates 1 May 2024, the Appellant applied for a second licence. This application was refused by the Registrar on 28 May 2024. The Appellant now appeals the Registrar’s decision.
The parties have agreed to a paper determination of the appeal. The Tribunal is satisfied that it can properly determine the issues without a hearing within rule 32(1)(b) of The Tribunal Procedure (First-tier Tribunal) (General Regulatory Chamber) Rules 2009 (as amended).
The Appeal
The Appellant’s Notice of Appeal dated 30 May 2024 relies on the following grounds:
The Appellant seeks an extended further trainee licence to enable him to book and take the instructional ability test and to continue gaining experience necessary for his career as a driving instructor.
There has been a lack of available dates for the Appellant to undertake his instructional ability test in Bishop’s Stortford where the appellant has been training. He has been checking regularly, but there have been no available tests up to and including September 2024 making it impossible to complete his training within the initial six month period. An extension of time will allow the Appellant to take his test in an area close to him.
The Appellant failed his first test of instructional ability as he had to take it in an unfamiliar area due to the lack of available test slots in his locality. Currently the waiting list for tests in his area exceeds six months which is beyond his control.
To maintain his skills and continue training new drivers, it is crucial for him to have a valid licence; the only way he can afford the vehicle used for training is by continuing to work and get paid.
The Registrar’s has filed a Statement of Case dated 6 June 2024 in which he resists the appeal. The Registrar says that:
the Appellant had failed to comply with the conditions of his first licence as he had returned the training record form AD121AT but had not completed all his training objectives.
the purpose of the provisions governing the issue of trainee licences is to afford applicants the opportunity of giving instruction to members of the public whilst endeavouring to achieve registration. The system of issuing licences is not an alternative to the system of registration.
the licence granted is not to enable for the instructor to teach for however long it takes to pass the exams but to allow a confined period of experience of instruction. Six months is ordinarily a very reasonable period in which to reach the necessary standard and in particular to obtain any necessary practical experience in tuition. The Appellant has already had a trainee licence, and by virtue of his appeal in respect of his latest application, his first licence has remain in force until the determination of that appeal, which allows him to continue to give paid instruction until determination of the appeal.
Since passing his driving ability test, the Appellant has failed the instructional ability test once. Despite ample time and opportunity the Appellant has not been able to reach the required standard of driving for qualification as an Approved Driving Instructor.
The refusal of a second licence does not bar the Appellant from attempting the instructional ability test. He does not need to hold a licence for that purpose, nor is it essential for him to give professional tuition under licence in order to obtain training.
The law
The grant of a trainee licence enables applicants to provide instruction for payment before they are qualified. The circumstances in which trainee licences may be granted are set out in section 129 of the Act and the Motor Cars (Driving Instruction) Regulations 2005.
A licence under section 129(1) of the Act is granted, “for the purpose of enabling a person to acquire practical experience in giving instruction in driving motor cars with a view to undergoing such part of the examination… as consists of a practical test of ability and fitness to instruct”.
In order to qualify as an Approved Driving Instructor, applicants must pass the Qualifying Examination. This is made up of: the written examination (Part 1); the driving ability and fitness test (Part 2); and the instructional ability and fitness test (Part 3). Three attempts are permitted at each part. The whole examination must be completed within two years of passing Part 1, otherwise the whole examination has to be retaken.
A candidate may be granted a trainee licence if they have passed Part 2. However, holding a trainee licence is not necessary in order to qualify as an Approved Driving Instructor, and many people qualify without having held a trainee licence.
The powers of the Tribunal in determining this appeal are set out in section 131 of the Act. The Tribunal may make such order as it thinks fit (section 131(3)). The Tribunal stands in the shoes of the Registrar and takes a fresh decision on the evidence available to it, giving appropriate weight to the Registrar’s decision as the person tasked by Parliament with making such decisions. The burden of proof in satisfying the Tribunal that the Registrar’s decision was wrong rests with the Appellant.
The evidence
I have considered a bundle of evidence containing 24 numbered pages. I have carefully considered all of the evidence in the hearing bundle. That evidence also includes a print out from the Appellant’s records from the Registrar. This shows that the Appellant passed his theory Part 1 test on 20 March 2023, and passed his Part 2 test on 27 June 2023. He failed a Part 3 test on 2 April 2024. A second Part 3 test was booked but was on hold as of 6 June 2024.
The evidence shows that the Registrar emailed the Appellant on 1 May 2024 indicating that he had not returned a form ADI21AT with his application for an extension or provided any explanation for failing to undergo this training. The Registrar explained that a failure to undergo this mandatory 20 hours of additional training was a breach of his first licence and that it was “unlikely that the Registrar will grant a replacement licence if you have not complied with the conditions of your previous one”.
The Appellant responded within a few hours and provided his ADI21AT form to the Registrar. He explained he had spoken to the DVSA and they had told him only to complete the online form, and apologised for the omission. The completed forms were dated 14 December 2023, 28 December 2023, 4 January 2024 and 10 January 2024 by the Appellant’s Driving Instructor. They show the Appellant receiving the mandatory 20 hours of additional training, albeit as set out below, seemingly not covering one training objective.
Discussion and Conclusion
The essential reason given by the Registrar in his Response for refusing to grant the Appellant a second licence was the Appellant’s purported failure to complete all of his training objectives as recorded in the AD1 21AT form. However, this is not clearly stated in the Registrar’s decision email of 28 May 2024 which simply refers to a failure to comply with unspecified “conditions of your first trainee licence”.
The Appellant has provided four AD121AT forms which show a total of 20 hours of instructional training time had been completed within the period of his first licence. However, since this has been done across four separate forms it is rather difficult to see whether all of the training objectives have been completed. It appears to the Tribunal that piecing these together, the Appellant has complied with all of the training objectives within the period of his first licence save for the third objective which is “making normal stops”.
There is an unfortunate lack of clarity in the Registrar’ position in this case throughout. His decision letter did not set out clearly why he claimed that the Appellant had not complied with the terms of his first licence. That is compounded by the fact that the Registrar’s response in this appeal has a number of errors which contribute to a position which is difficult to understand and which lacks the requisite clarity. For example:
Paragraph 3 of the Registrar’s response states that the Appellant’s first licence was valid from 30 October 2024 to 29 April 2024. Clearly this is not possible. The Tribunal works on the presumption that the first date was intended to be a reference to 30 October 2023 as this fits the broader chronology.
Paragraph 4 of the Registrar’s response states that the Appellant applied for a second licence on 19 October 2024. Again this cannot be right. It is likely to be a date in April 2024, but the Tribunal should not be left to guess.
The third sentence of paragraph 4 of the Registrar’s response is incomplete and it is not immediately apparent what point is being made.
While paragraph 5 of the Registrar’s response acknowledges that the Appellant had completed the ADI21AT form, the Registrar now adopts a new criticism namely that not “all training objectives” had been completed. He does not specify which objective(s) were not completed. None of the purported reasons for refusing the application in paragraph 6 of the Response relate to this specific issue at all.
Paragraph 6(ii) of the Registrar’s response says that the Appellant has applied for his second licence before the expiry of the first licence, but no date is given in the papers for the Tribunal to verify this.
S.129(4) of the Road Traffic Act 1988 requires the Registrar to “state the grounds of the refusal” when refusing to extend a trainee licence. The rationale for such a statutory requirement is to allow the applicant to understand the grounds for their unsuccessful application and, if appropriate, consider whether an appeal is justified.
I am not satisfied that the Appellant’s letter of 28 May 2024 was sufficient in this regard. While I accept that such reasons need not be lengthy, they must give the applicant some sufficiently clear understanding of the basis on which their application has been refused so that they can address this or appeal the decision. It is unsatisfactory for the real reasons to emerge in the Response to an appeal, and even then rather obliquely and with a lack of clarity. It should not be for the Tribunal to divine them from the evidence. Nothing in that reasoning should however be taken from detracting from a trainee driving instructor’s obligations to provide clear information in compliance with their trainee licence to the Registrar, including confirming that they have fulfilled their training objectives. The use of multiple forms by the Appellant in this regard has undoubtedly contributed to the lack of clarity. It does appear that he may indeed have failed to establish one objective, but the fact that this has not been clearly stated by the Registrar means that the Appellant has not been able to address it.
The central ground of the Appellant’s appeal is the lack of tests within his local area. The Respondent’s grounds of appeal do not address this at all, save in the most generic way. The Tribunal’s recent experience on appeals suggests that a lack of available tests is increasingly common in many places across the country and there are often long delays. Indeed, at paragraph 7 of the Response, the Registrar acknowledges that the Appellant’s second instructional ability test is “booked on hold, awaiting a test date”. I therefore accept the Appellant’s evidence about the delays he has experienced in booking his second test. If there are substantial delays in test availability, then this should be a factor which should be afforded proper weight by the Registrar when considering an application for an extension of a second training licence. That is not to say that the grant of a licence should be open ended. A licence is not a substitute for taking and passing the instructional ability test.
In all the circumstances, and in particular given that this was a request for a first extension of his trainee licence (i.e. a second licence in total), I am not satisfied that the Registrar was correct to refuse the Appellant’s request for a second licence.
Having reached this conclusion, the next step is to consider what order should be made by the Tribunal on the application under s.131(3) of the Act.
In this case, given the length of time it has taken for the appeal to be heard, the period during which a second licence would have lasted – from 30 April 2024 to 29 October 2024 has long since passed. The only information available to the Tribunal since the Registrar’s Response is a brief statement in the Appellant’s Certificate of Compliance dated 21 October 2024 that “due to the length of time it takes (months) to have a booked Part 3 test I ran out of time on my trainee licence”. This in essence repeats the grounds of appeal, and neither the Appellant or the Registrar has provided any update about the Appellant’s ability to take and pass a Part 3 test since then. Since the Registrar accepts that the Appellant had applied for his second licence before his first licence expired, he has had the benefit of his first licence continuing in effect until the determination of this appeal.
In those circumstances, I consider that the Appellant has by now had more than sufficient time to gain experience of training to pass his Part 3 test, having had just short of 15 months of an extended trainee licence. On his own account, the Appellant considered a second licence would be sufficient for him to book and take his Part 3 test again in an area close to him. There is no evidence before me which would justify any further extension having regard to the public policy reasons for granting a trainee licence cited by the Registrar in his Response. Moreover the two year statutory time limit for the Appellant to pass his Part 3 test is due to expire on 20 March 2025, two months from today.
I therefore decline to grant the Appellant any further extension of his trainee licence. He has had, in effect, the benefit of almost one and further one and a half licence extensions by virtue of this appeal.
The appeal is therefore allowed but no further trainee licence is granted.

Deputy Costs Judge Roy
Introduction
This is my judgment on the first defendant’s preliminary point that the claimant’s Points of Dispute (“PoDs”) are non-compliant and should be struck out.
The matter was listed before me for a detailed assessment of the first defendant’s costs with a time estimate of one day.  That estimate was always wholly inadequate and unrealistic.  I shall return to this point at the conclusion of this judgment.
In the event, submissions on this preliminary point took nearly all day.  Moreover, I wished to review the papers again, there having been a late piecemeal flurry of documents from both sides which only reached me shortly before the hearing commenced. I therefore reserved judgment.
This judgment is structured as follows:
Background.
Law
Application of the law to the facts.
Conclusion and disposal.
Other matters.
I have considered all the matters to which my attention has been drawn.  I shall not rehearse all of them. This judgment is already probably far too long for a preliminary point on a bill totalling a little over £132,000.
Background
The claimant brought a claim against the first defendant (his former solicitors) and the second defendant (his former counsel) for professional negligence (“the professional negligence claim”).
The professional negligence claim arose from four claims between the claimant and her sister (collectively “the original claims”).  Two of these were decided against the claimant at trial.  In both, the trial judges found in uncompromising terms that the claimant was dishonest.
The Defendants applied to strike out and/or for summary judgment in respect of the professional negligence claim.
The application was heard by Knowles J on 5 to 6 December 2022.  The claimant was at that time represented by direct access counsel.
Knowles J handed down a detailed reserved judgment on 13 June 2023.  This ran to 73 pages and 250 paragraphs.
In summary he held as follows:
The claimant’s Particulars of Claim disclosed no reasonable grounds for bringing the claim, and the claim had no reasonable prospects of success.
The claim was also an abuse of process.
The claimant’s pleading was in any event non-compliant.  It was the antithesis of a concise statement of facts that would enable the defendants to understand the claim that they had to meet and to enable the court to identify the issues and give appropriate directions for a proportionate determination of the claim.  It was in parts incoherent and impossible to follow. These deficiencies were pointed out to the claimant long before the application and she had done nothing to seek to rectify them.  It would therefore not have been appropriate to grant permission to amend.
The claim against the second defendant was barred for the additional reason that it was subject to a prior binding compromise to the effect that he would accept a reduction in his fees in consideration for the claimant not pursuing any further complaint against him.  In so finding Knowles J referred to various communications amongst the three parties which culminated in this agreement.
The professional negligence claim was thus struck out on three alternative grounds (four in the case of the second defendant), any one of which would have been sufficient.
In relation to the first basis of strike out, the claimant raised before Knowles J an issue as to the accuracy of the transcripts from one the trials in the original claims (that before Mr Recorder Cohen QC) relied upon by the first defendant.  This was dealt with in the judgment as follows:
I asked for a schedule of Miss Sandells' [counsel for the first defendant] references, which I was provided with after the hearing. Niki had the opportunity to comment on this schedule, and did so.
In the event, I have not found it necessary to refer to this schedule or the transcripts. Given this judgment is already long – probably too long - I think it would be disproportionate for me to start delving into the evidence. I have reached a clear conclusion based upon the judgments of the judges who heard that evidence, and they were obviously best placed to assess it. Furthermore, an issue arose at a very late stage – during the hearing - as to whether the transcripts I had been sent were accurate and there were different versions of transcripts later supplied to me. The whole picture was very confused. That confusion, obviously, did not clarify matters.
My reading of this (which as per below, coincides with that of Stuart-Smith LJ) is as follows:
The first defendant relied upon parts of the trial transcripts.
The claimant was given the opportunity to dispute the accuracy of these.  She availed herself of this.
Knowles J did not in the event take the transcripts into account.  He found for the defendants without reference to them.
As the claimant’s allegations as to the accuracy of the transcripts – which in any event were very confused and unclear - were only deployed to rebut the defendants’ reliance upon those transcripts, they fell away. In other words, they were irrelevant.
On 10 July 2023 Knowles J made consequential orders, including that the claimant pay the defendants’ costs on the indemnity basis.  He appended brief reasons.
The claimant (by this stage acting in person) sought permission to appeal.  This was refused by Stuart-Smith LJ.  The reasons were longer than one often sees, but no less emphatic for that.
Importantly, the claimant placed her complaint about the transcripts of the trial before Recorder Cohen QC front and centre of her appeal.  Stuart-Smith LJ dismissed this complaint in the following terms in the context of the claimant’s challenge to Knowles J’s finding that the professional negligence claim had no real prospect of success (emphasis added):
Ground 1 is headed “wrong decision” and asserts that Knowles J relied upon inaccurate transcripts at paras 173-177 of his judgment as the basis for his decision.  The Claimant asserts that the corrected transcripts contain crucial evidence relating to her hearing disability.  Her skeleton argument cites passages where it is asserted that the transcripts that were before Mr Recorder Cohen were inaccurate.  I have followed all of the references provided by the Claimant in support of this Ground as best I can, though I am unable to detect any potential relevance at all in a number of them.  There are, however, straightforward reasons why there is no substance in this Ground in relation to Knowles J’s first issue:
First, Mr Recorder Cohen was aware that the “professional note of evidence” that was provided during his trial was “not as accurate as would be a transcript of the tape recording. Caution is therefore needed when reading this note both for names which are not completely accurate and occasionally, for sense. Nonetheless it has truly lessened my burden and enabled the evidence to be taken much faster than the speed of my pen.”: see para 5.4 of the Cohen judgment.  It is therefore plain that the Recorder was fully aware of the potential inaccuracy of the note.  There is no reason to believe that he would have been misled by any inaccuracy when forming his determinative conclusions and writing his judgment.
Second, despite an exorbitant effort to obtain corrected transcripts and to identify each alleged inaccuracy, the Claimant has not identified any inaccuracy that either did influence or could have influenced the Recorder either during the hearing or when preparing his judgment so that he would have reached a different conclusion on the central question of the Claimant’s honesty and accuracy as a witness.  Though I have not read the entirety of the tracking of alleged errors, I have read enough to be satisfied that the great majority are completely inconsequential.  I have not identified any that could have materially misled the Recorder.
Third, if there had been substance in this point, it could and should have been taken on appeal.  It was not.
Fourth, there is no possibility that the Claimant’s complaints about a failure to make reasonable adjustments for her disability would lead to a finding that the outcome of the actions before Mr Recorder Cohen and HHJ Johns would or might have been different if other adjustments had been made.
Fifth, Knowles J reached his conclusion on the first issue at para 172 and only then referred to submissions that were made on the basis of the transcripts at paras 173-177.  He took the view, which he was entitled to take, that he would not delve into the evidence in the transcripts to which the First Defendant was referring in support of the First Defendant’s submissions.  To that extent his approach was favourable to the Claimant: it is evident that he did not rely upon the disputed transcripts to her disadvantage.
Fifth, I reject the submission that inaccuracies in the “transcripts” prejudiced the Claimant’s ability to present her case. She has not identified any respect in which an inaccuracy in the original note of evidence prevented her from presenting her case fully to either Mr Recorder Cohen or HHJ Johns or Morgan J or Knowles J. Her submission that it has seems to me to ignore completely the basis for the various judges’ findings, none of which was dependent upon the accuracy of the note of transcript.
The claimant also relied upon the allegedly inaccurate transcripts in respect of the finding of abuse of process.  Stuart-Smith LJ rejected this in the following terms:
In subsequent paragraphs of section 5 dealing with this ground, the Claimant reverts to the issue of the unreliable transcripts. For the reasons I have given above, I do not consider that there is any substance in those complaints.
It is thus clear that Stuart-Smith LJ carefully considered the claimant’s allegations regarding the transcripts and rejected them emphatically.
That marked the end of the line for the professional negligence claim, save for the assessment of the defendants’ costs.
The second defendant’s bill came before me for provisional assessment in December 2023.  The PoDs were very similar to those in respect of the first defendant.  I dismissed all but a handful of the claimant’s points in the following terms (or variations thereof):
This is not a proper point of dispute.  It does not articulate any comprehensible challenge to the costs I am assessing.  Nor does it specify, as required per Ainsworth v Stewarts Law LLP [2020] EWCA Civ 178, which items are being challenged.
The claimant sought to challenge the provisional assessment.  However, compounding and doubling down on the defects in the PoDs, the document requesting an oral hearing wholly failed to specify itemised challenges to the provisional assessment as required by the rules.
I therefore held that the claimant was precluded from challenging the provisional assessment; Christodoulides v Holbech [2024] EWHC 2172 (SCCO).  The relevant parts of my extempore reasoning for present purposes were as follows:
The letter [seeking to challenge the provisional assessment] simply does not identify the item or items in the provisional assessment, which are to be reviewed. There were 43, I think, items provisionally assessed. What was required was for them to be identified by number, or at least one way or another. The letter simply does not do this …
I pause here to add that non-compliance of the 12 April letter is in no way cured by the subsequent application. It likewise does not identify the items in the provisional assessment to be challenged.
Instead, very much like the letter of 12 April, it contains wide-ranging complaints of unfairness, lack of transparency, improper conduct of various practices and so forth on behalf of the second defendant and/or his lawyers. It still does not ""identify the item or items in the court's provisional assessment which are sought to be reviewed"".
I have listened very carefully to what the claimant has said today. I have explained the rules more than once. I have ensured that they are set out for her, and indeed physically displayed in front of her in the White Book. I repeatedly explained the nature of the hearing and encouraged her to focus her submissions on the question of why there should be an oral hearing despite what the rules say. Having done so I have heard nothing to change my original vie
I appreciate it is difficult for a litigant in person to direct their arguments with appropriate focus, but the fact of the matter is that virtually all of the claimant's submissions have really been directed at the allegations of misconduct and fabrication which go to the substance of the case rather than why the provisional assessment should be re-opened despite non-compliance with the rules. I asked her why the rules could not have been complied with and she was not able to identify any real answer to that.
I should say I fully accept in principle that, for example via CPR 44.14, if there has been misconduct that does empower the court to disallow some or all of a party's costs. However, that does not change the fact that the claimant was required to comply with CPR 47.15 in order to re-open the provisional assessment.
I appreciate that the claimant feels very strongly about all these matters and I also appreciate that acting without lawyers is very difficult, stressful and challenging. I agree that some leeway is justified. However, it cannot justify this level of non-compliance. I refer here to the judgment of Barton v Wright Hassell LLP [2018] UKSC 12; [2018] 1 WLR 1119, per Lord Sumption at [18], and I quote:
“In current circumstances the court will appreciate that a litigating in person is not always a matter of choice. At a time when the availability of legal aid and conditional fee agreements have been restricted some litigants may have little option but to represent themselves. Their lack of representation will often justify making allowances in making case management decisions and in conducting hearings. But it will not usually justify applying to litigants in person a lower standard of compliance with the rules or orders of the court. The overriding objective requires the court so far as practical to enforce compliance with the rules, CPR rule 1.1(1)(f). Rules do not in any relevant respect distinguish between represented and unrepresented parties. In applications under CPR 3.9 for relief from sanctions it is now well established that the fact that the applicant was unrepresented at the relevant time is not in itself a reason not to enforce rules of the court against him”.
There are other cases to that effect quoted therein. With reference to R (Hysaj) v Secretary of State [2014] EWCA Civ 1633; [2015] 1 WLR, Lord Sumption continued:
“At best, it may affect the issue ""at the margin"", as Briggs LJ observed (para 53) in the latter case, which I take to mean that it may increase the weight to be given to some other, more directly relevant factor. It is fair to say that in applications for relief from sanctions, this is mainly because of what I have called the disciplinary factor, which is less significant in the case of applications to validate defective service of a claim form. There are, however, good reasons for applying the same policy to applications under CPR rule 6.15(2) simply as a matter of basic fairness. The rules provide a framework within which to balance the interest of both sides. That balance is inevitably disturbed if an unrepresented litigant is entitled to greater indulgence in complying with them than his represented opponent. Any advantage enjoyed by a litigant in person imposes a corresponding disadvantage on the other side, which may be significant if it affects the latter's legal rights, under the Limitation Acts for example. Unless the rules and practice directions are particularly inaccessible or obscure, it is reasonable to expect a litigant in person to familiarise himself with the rules which apply to any step which he is about to take.”
… The claimant has, for no good reason which I have been able to identify or which has been evidenced or explained, simply failed to comply with the rules. Indeed, she has made no attempt to do so, and still today does not seem to recognise the need to do so. There is no suggestion that, for example, she took the basic step of trying to ascertain what the relevant rules (which are readily available on the internet) said and required. By reference to the case of Barton, which I have just quoted, being an unrepresented party is not by itself a good reason for non-compliance.
There are powerful factors militating against relief:
This is not a minor slip. It is not, for example, a case of a request being served a day later. There has been wholesale non-compliance.
This non-compliance is persistent and continuing. Notwithstanding the terms of my order of 7 May 2024, there has still be no attempt to provide a compliant request. The application notice did not contain or append any such. It was really just more of the same. In my judgment it would be contrary to the overriding objective to allow what would be a third bite of the cherry. This is especially as the claimant has not stated any intention to rectify the problem by producing a compliant request.
To allow non-compliance here would undermine the very point of the rule, which is to ensure that any oral hearing should be conducted properly and fairly and within properly identified limits in accordance with the overriding objective. See by analogy PME v The Scout Association [2019] EWHC 3421 (QB); [2020] 1 WLR 1217 and Ainsworth v Stewarts Law LLP [2020] EWCA Civ 178; [2020] 1 WLR 2664. In other words it is not to be a free-for-all. If I were to allow an oral hearing on the basis of the current request I am afraid to say that free-for-all is precisely what the assessment would be.
I finally turn to the point which the claimant emphasised the most, namely that she raises very serious allegations. I accept that she does. I also accept that such allegations could only really be properly determined on a full assessment on an oral hearing.
However, that is not sufficient to outweigh the other factors. This is especially do as:
The fact that serious allegations are raised is not by itself any excuse for non-compliance: Gentry v Miller [2016] EWCA Civ 141; [2016] 1 WLR 2696.
In this case, the point cuts both ways. Indeed, in my view overall it tells against the application. Fairness to those facing such serious allegations (and at the moment they are just allegations, I can make no finding either way as to their merits) requires that the allegations be clearly and precisely identified so that they have a fair and proper chance to meet them. That would simply will not be possible given the non-compliance here.
As will be apparent, the claimant’s modus operandi in respect of the second defendant’s costs has been essentially identical to her modus operandi in to respect of the first defendant’s which I am now considering.  Her approach to this assessment has been in effect an unwavering continuation of her approach to the previous one.
The first defendant served its bill separately in March 2024.  The PoDs were served in April 2024.  The Replies were served in May 2024.  Thus the matter has come before me for assessment.
Law
PD 47.8.2 provides as follows (emphasis added):
Points of Dispute must be short and to the point. They must follow Precedent G in the Schedule of Costs Precedents annexed to this Practice Direction, so far as practicable. They must:
Identify any general points or matters of principle which require decision before the individual items in the bill are addressed; and
Identify specific points, stating concisely the nature and grounds of dispute.
Once a point has been identified it should not be repeated but the item numbers where the point arises should be inserted in the left hand box as shown in Precedent G.
Binding and authoritative guidance on these requirements was given by Asplin LJ in Ainsworth v Stewarts Law LLP [2020] EWCA Civ 178; [2020] 1 WLR 2664
Ainsworth was solicitor client assessment.  The receiving party contended that the challenge to document time within the PoDs was non-compliant.  As recorded by the Court of Appeal at [6], this point was pleaded follows:
The Claimant [i.e. the paying party] requests the court to note that over a period of 11 working days the Defendant seeks to claim 46.8 hours of work which is equivalent to approximately 4.3 hours of time every single day. It is the clear opinion of the Claimant that under any stretch of the imagination, the level of time expended can in no way be justified and against the relevant test, the time expended, and its subsequent cost must be deemed to be unusual in nature and amount.
As with the timed attendances upon the Claimant, the Claimant is mindful of the requirements of the Civil Procedure Rules as to the need to keep Points of Dispute brief and succi
nct. It must therefore be stated that all entries are disputed. By way of general indication however, the Claimant can confirm the main issues with the document time are as follows:
Significant duplication between fee earners
Wholly excessive time expended by fee earners reviewing documentation provided by the Claimant
Too much time claimed generally in relation to preparation
An excessive level of time claimed in relation to drafting of communications
Unnecessary inter-fee earner discussions arising due to the duplication
Excessive time spent collating documentation
Significant preparation time claimed in relation to meetings with the Claimant.
It can be confirmed that the above stated list is not exhaustive of the issues but provide a general overview as to the reason why the time claimed is unusual in nature and/or amount. The Claimant reserved their position generally
Chief Master Gordon-Saker upheld the receiving party’s complaint and dismissed this point on the basis that it had not been properly pleaded.  His reasons were set out by the Court of Appeal at [10]:
In oral submissions, Mr Poole on behalf of the claimant seeks to take a broad brush approach to the document schedule and indicated that what he would like to do is to identify some particular items and explain why those are unreasonable, with a view to persuading the court that the time overall should be reduced on a broad brush approach and he candidly accepted, as one might expect, that the items which he would be relying on in particular would be the biggest items in terms of the time spent.
The difficulty with that, it seems to me, is that the claimant has not set out in his points of dispute which items he wishes to challenge and why and that does cause, as the defendant has indicated in its reply, a difficulty insofar as – in respect of items which have not yet been identified – they would need to look at the attendance notes to see what work was done and why and the context in which it was done in order to seek to explain why the time claimed is reasonable, if indeed that is the objection, or why a particular fee earner was engaged in doing it and why possibly more than one fee earner was engaged in doing it.
The purpose of points of dispute is really to prevent that work being done on the hoof in the course of a hearing. The solicitors are entitled to know specifically which items are challenged and the reasons for the challenge. Insofar as the claimant states that all entries are disputed, it seems to me that it would be beholden on him to explain why each particular entry is challenged and whether he is asserting that no time should be allowed or reduced time should be allowed or whether the work should have been done by a different grade of fee earner. But, as pleaded, the points of dispute, it seems to me, do not raise a proper challenge to the documents items and certainly do not raise a challenge which can be properly answered by the defendant without a considerable amount of time being spent in looking at the papers to reply to that challenge and that, it seems to me, is a process, which if it is to be done, should be done in advance of the hearing rather than at the hearing.
One can well understand why Mr Poole is seeking to adopt the approach that he is of encouraging the court to take a broad brush but the difficulty with that approach is that we are not going to be looking at every item, we will only be looking at particular items and presently, apart from Mr Poole, none of us knows which items those are going to be. It seems to me that that does put the defendant in a difficult position. It also puts the court in a difficult position. I read the papers in the light of the points of dispute as they are pleaded and I was not able to identify which particular items are challenged or why.
In the circumstances, I think the only fair course is to dismiss that point of dispute 10 on the basis that it has not been properly pleaded.
The paying party’s appeal was dismissed by His Honour Judge Klein sitting as a judge of the High Court.  The Court of Appeal dismissed the paying party’s second appeal, Asplin LJ reasoning as follows:
37 Accordingly, 47PD.8 para 8.2 is directly relevant. It makes it absolutely clear that points of dispute should be short and to the point and, therefore, focussed. Furthermore, sub-paragraphs (a) and (b) leave no doubt about the way in which the draftsman should proceed. General points and matters of principle which require consideration before individual items in the bill or bills are addressed, should be identified, and then specific points should be made ""stating concisely the nature and grounds of dispute."" Such an approach is entirely consistent with the recommendations and observations made in the Review of Civil Litigation Costs: Final Report, 2009 to which we were referred.
Common sense dictates that the points of dispute must be drafted in a way which enables the parties and the court to determine precisely what is in dispute and why. That is the very purposes of such a document. It is necessary in order to enable the receiving party, the solicitor in this case, to be able to reply to the complaints. It is also necessary in order to enable the court to deal with the issues raised in a manner which is fair, just and proportionate.
As I have already mentioned, the complaint should be short, to the point and focussed. As para 8.2(b) of 47PD.8 indicates, that requires the draftsman not only to identify general points and matters of principle but to identify specific points stating concisely the ""nature and grounds of the dispute"" … Having explained the nature and grounds of dispute succinctly, the draftsman should insert the numbers of the items disputed on that ground in the relevant box. The principle is very simple. In order to deal with matters of this kind fairly, justly and proportionately, it is necessary that both the recipient and the court can tell why an item is disputed. The recipient must be placed in a position in which it can seek to justify the items which are in dispute
Application of the law to the facts
Ms Bedford fairly conceded that several of the points within the PoDs, namely 1, 31, and 49.6, whilst far from ideally pleaded, sufficiently identified what was being challenged and why (at least to an extent).
She nevertheless contended that (a) all the points stand or fall together; (b) as the PoDs as a whole were non-compliant they should be struck out entirely, including any compliant points therein.
I do not accept this.  There is no logical or principled reason why the compliant points should be struck out.  It would be unfair to the claimant and would constitute a windfall to the first defendant.  Such an all or nothing approach is not applied to substantive pleadings.  No reason to apply it to costs proceeding was identified or is identifiable.
The analysis below therefore excludes these compliant points, which I will in due course determine on their merits in the normal way.
The PoDs in general
These could scarcely be less compliant:
They are the antithesis of short, to the point and focussed.  They are prolix (32 pages in length), discursive, and unfocused.  They for the most part consist of a scattershot litany of allegations of misconduct and the like which have little if anything to do with the reasonableness of the first defendant’s costs.
Whilst it would have been practicable to follow Precedent G, at least substantially, there has been no attempt whatsoever to do so.  The PoDs completely fail to do so.
They do not identify the items in dispute.  Notwithstanding their length, they do cite a single item number from the bill.
They do not identify, or least not in any coherent or comprehensible fashion, what reductions in costs the points raised are said to generate, and why.
There has thus been wholesale non-compliance.  More basically, the PoDs are, as Ms Bedford submitted, virtually incomprehensible.
These PoDs therefore contain all the defects identified in Ainsworth and O’Sullivan, but (a) to a much greater extent than in those cases; and (b) with other serious defects in addition.
Given that the PoDs in Ainsworth and O’Sullivan were struck out, as a matter of inexorable logic, these PoDs must likewise be struck out.
The bottom line is that the wholesale defects in the PoDs make it impossible to conduct the assessment in a manner which is fair, manageable, proportionate and in accordance with the overriding objective.
These problems were in no way cured or ameliorated by the claimant’s written submissions (set out in three documents received by me shortly before the start of the hearing and further unsolicited set emailed to me the day following the hearing) or her oral submissions.  Quite the contrary:
The submissions effectively doubled down on the misguided approach adopted within the PoDs.  The claimant repeated and expanded upon her allegations of misconduct and insisted on seeking to revisit matters decided in the substantive litigation notwithstanding that I repeatedly highlighted that this was not the purpose of the hearing and was not permissible.  I will return to these matters below, but the short point here is that these allegations do nothing to address the issues of the PoDs being non-compliant.
With one brief exception, the claimant’s submission failed to address the question of compliance at all.  My repeated invitations and urgings to the claimant to address me on the actual point I had to decide proved futile.  She simply refused to engage with the point at all.
The exception was a suggestion by the claimant that the fact that she only received the file of papers from the original claims (i.e. the underlying litigation against her sister) at the start of November 2024 somehow excused non-compliance.  I reject this:
I do not accept that the claimant required these papers to produce compliant PoDss.  These papers – which are several removes from the costs I am assessing – cannot have had anything more than marginal relevance at most to that exercise.   The papers that mattered were those from the professional negligence claim.
If it truly were the case that the absence of these papers was an insuperable obstacle, the claimant should have applied for an extension rather than producing non-compliant PoDs.
The claimant has in any event had these papers for well over a month.  She made no attempt whatsoever to deploy them to produce compliant PoDs.
Indeed, given the consistent pattern of the claimant’s conduct and approach, I have no real doubt that the absence of these papers made no difference to compliance:
The claimant’s mindset is that she is entitled to advance whichever points she wishes in whatever manner she wishes as many times as she wishes irrespective of the requirements of the rules and of the court’s rulings.
She does not appear at any time even to have attempted to identify what the applicable requirements are, much less make any attempt to comply with them.
At no point has she ever even acknowledged the existence of any requirement under the rules.  Much less has she acknowledged any possible non-compliance.  Still less has she sought to rectify such non-compliance.
This is all the more striking given that both the professional negligence claim itself and her previous challenges to the second defendant’s costs were both struck out for defective and non-compliant pleadings.
Even when the applicable requirements were been drawn to her attention repeatedly during the two hearings before me, she simply ignored them in favour of making submissions on other matters.
It is therefore clear to me that the claimant (i) never had any intention to produce compliant PoDs, (ii) was never going to have had any intention to do so, and (iii) almost certainly never will have any intention to do so.
Point (4) immediately above goes to the root of the problems in this assessment (and indeed in the previous one of the second defendant’s costs).  The claimant’s mindset is that she is the aggrieved party, that the other side are in the wrong, and that the rules therefore should not apply to her.  Her entire approach as described above reflects this.  Such a mindset and approach are profoundly misguided.  They are not ones which the court could possibly tolerate, much less endorse.
I add that the claimant did not apply for an adjournment.  However, even had she done so, I would not have been minded to grant one:
Per Ainsworth at [11]:
An adjournment was then sought in order that further Points of Dispute could be filed. The Chief Master refused an adjournment on the basis that: the deficiency in the Points of Dispute had been pointed out in the Points of Reply almost six months before the hearing but Mr Ainsworth chose not to serve anything more.
This decision was upheld.  The claimant here can be in no better position.
The reasons for not granting relief in respect of the second defendant’s costs as set out above apply here.  Indeed, they do so with even greater force.  My previous judgment made crystal clear to the claimant what needed to be done properly to challenge costs and the consequences of not doing so in a compliant way.  Ainsworth itself was specifically referenced numerous times in the provisional assessment and then again in the judgement. It is evident that the claimant has paid no heed to this whatsoever.  The judgment was nearly six months ago, giving her ample to time to revisit thee PoDs in this assessment.
Indeed, the claimant was placed on even earlier clear notice of the general need to plead clearly and properly and of the terminal consequences of failing to do so.  This was one of the bases upon which the professional negligence claim was struck out, which of course was the very event giving rise to the defendants’ costs.
Given the claimant’s mindset, I see no real prospect of the defects being cured were an adjournment granted.
Conduct arguments
The claimant makes various allegations of misconduct against the first defendant and its advisers.  The two pursued in oral submissions were (1) alleged alteration of trial transcripts from the original claims (referred to above); and (2) alleged breach of privilege.
These allegations are a somewhat separate issue and could potentially survive notwithstanding the defects in the PoDs.
That is because CPR 44.11 provides a freestanding power to reduce costs in the event of misconduct.  Moreover, the power is punitive rather than compensatory; Gempride Ltd v Bamrah [2018] EWCA Civ 1367; [2019] 1 WLR 1545 at [14].  There is therefore no need to identify any connection between the misconduct and any particular element of the bill. Such reductions can be, and often are, broad brush e.g. disallowance of a percentage of the costs.
Indeed, given that the misconduct need not relate to any particular element with the bill it is not necessary to plead any CPR 44.11 point within the PoDs, although it will generally be convenient to do so.  The allegations could for example be made in a standalone application.
However, in this particular case, I have no doubt that the claimant’s allegations fall to be struck out for the following reasons, any one of which would be sufficient.  These overlap to a degree.
Firstly, the matters in question were raised and rejected in the professional negligence claim.  Insofar as they were not, they should have been raised at that stage.  The claimant is therefore precluded from resurrecting them by the doctrines of issue estoppel and/or the rule in Henderson v Henderson (1843) 3 Hare 100; Virgin Atlantic Airways Ltd v Zodiac Seats UK Ltd [2013] UKSC 46; [2014] AC 160 at [22], at [32-33], Finzi v Jamaican Redevelopment Foundation Inc & Ors (Jamaica) [2023] UKPC 29; [2024] WLR 541 at [32-33].
Secondly, even leaving aside these doctrines, my role is limited to assessing the second defendant’s costs so as to give effect to Knowles J’s order.  It is no part of my function to retry matters in the substantive litigation.  I have no jurisdiction to do so.  It would be wholly inappropriate for me to do so. I repeatedly made this clear to the claimant during the hearing.   She ignored this and continued to seek to press these matters regardless.
Thirdly, in the absence of an order reserving conduct issues in the substantive litigation to assessment, CPR 44.11 ordinary applies only to misconduct in the assessment proceedings as opposed to the substantive litigation. See Andrews v Retro Computers Ltd [2019] 1 WLUK 237.  The defendants in Andrews alleged that the first claimant had, among other things, lied in his witness statements, misled the court in several respects, abused the defendants' websites, hacked emails, and raised false allegations.  It will be observed that there are significant parallels with the claimant’s approach here.
Deputy Master Friston held that it would be contrary to the overriding objective to interpret CPR 44.11 as permitting parties to lengthen detailed assessment proceedings by effectively allowing them a second bite at the cherry. Unless certain issues had been reserved to detailed assessment, costs judges would be overstepping the mark if they made wholesale reductions that would properly be within the remit of the judge who made the order for costs. In ordinary circumstances, CPR 44.11 should not be used to allow paying parties to adjust or negate their costs liability for reasons that were, or could have been, addressed when the costs order was made.
Whilst there is a legitimate debate as to precisely where the line here should be drawn, I find that reasoning entirely persuasive insofar as it applies to this case.  This is the clearest possible example of an illegitimate attempt to take a second bite of cherry. Indeed, it could be said to be the third or even the fourth bite of the cherry, given that these matters have (or at least could have been) raised in the original claims, before Knowles J and then when seeking permission to appeal.  I refer back to one of the reasons given by Stuart-Smith LJ for refusing such permission on the basis of alleged discrepancies with the transcript “if there had been substance in this point, it could and should have been taken on appeal [i.e. in the original claims].  It was not.”
The claimant at one point argued that Knowles J had reserved these matters to the detailed assessment when making the costs order giving rise to this assessment.  It is clear from the order and the accompanying reasons that he did no such thing.  The order itself contains no reservation.  The reasons insofar as material simply say that the quantum of costs was a matter for detailed assessment.
Pausing there, irrespective of which analytical rubric is applied, this is the clearest possible abuse of process.  As I have already noted, the bulk of claimant’s submissions sought resurrect matters already rejected Knowles J and Stuart Smith LJ.  Indeed, at times she seemed to be inviting me to revisit matters determined in the original claims.
This in fact might fairly be described as doubly abusive.  It is collateral attack on the findings in the professional negligence claim, which was itself held to be an abusive collateral attack on the findings in the original claims.
The clearest example is in respect of the transcripts.  Point 10 of the PoDs pleads as follows:
Inaccuracies in Take Note Transcripts. It is disputed that the transcripts relied upon by DW Law and presented as accurate before Judge Knowles were significantly inaccurate and unreliable. A forensic word track assessment report comparing the Take Note transcripts to the official court transcripts from Ubiquis revealed substantial discrepancies, as follows:
Date: 6/12/16
Take Note Transcripts Revisions: 2,903
Date: 7 /12/16
Take Note Transcripts Revisions: 9,518
Date: 8/12/16
Take Note Transcripts Revisions: 9,203
Date: 9/12/16
Take Note Transcripts Revisions: 7,732
Date: 12/12/16
Take Note Transcripts Revisions: 9,644
Date: 13/12/16
Take Note Transcripts Revisions: 4,424
Date: 14/12/16
Take Note Transcripts Revisions: 9,353
Date: 15/12/16
Take Note Transcripts Revisions: 9,615
Total Revisions: 62,383 revisions from the official court recorded transcripts.
This extensive number of revisions indicates a significant level of discrepancy between the Take Note transcripts and the official court transcripts. The inaccuracies in the Take Note transcripts undermine their reliability and raise serious questions about the evidence presented by DW Law before Judge Knowles.
These are precisely the same matters the claimant unsuccessfully sought to rely upon when seeking permission to appeal.
Fourthly, the allegations are not pleaded with sufficient precision or clarity.  I have already described the prolix, scattershot and virtually impenetrable nature of the pleading.  Whilst the specific requirement relating to PoDs do not apply here, the basic general requirement that allegations need to be formulated with sufficient precision and clarity to enable the other side and the court can understand them remains applicable.  Indeed, it applies with even greater force here given the serious nature of the allegations for the reasons I set out in my judgment in respect of the second defendant’s costs.  (A point to which the claimant, all too characteristically, has paid no heed to whatsoever.)
Fifthly, partly as result of the nature of the pleading, it would be impossible to investigate and determine these allegations in a proportionate manner.  In my view, even at their very highest these are side issues capable of generating no more than a very small reduction in the overall costs.  The time and costs required to undertake the granular consideration sought by the claimant would not be worth the candle.  It would be the epitome of wasteful satellite litigation.  This is not permissible.  See by analogy Manzanilla Ltd. v Corton Property and Investments Ltd., Court of Appeal, 1997-April-23 per Lord Woolf MR:
The ability of the court to make a wasted costs order can have advantages, but it can be of no advantage if it is going to result in complex proceedings which involve detailed investigation of facts. If a situation involves detailed investigation of facts, and indeed acts of dishonesty, then it may well be that a wasted costs order procedure is largely inappropriate to cover the situation, except in what would be an exceptional case. … If this limits the ability of someone … to obtain a wasted costs order, then in my judgment that is a restriction inherent in the nature of the remedy which they are seeking to receive. It would destroy that remedy if the court did not, except in an exceptional case, insist upon the matter being dealt with summarily.
The CPR 44.11 jurisdiction closely parallels the wasted costs jurisdiction.
Sixthly, I can see no merit in the allegations.  The claimant was unable to articulate or demonstrate any arguable case for misconduct.
As regards the transcripts point, when pressed the claimant disclaimed that she was alleging that the defendant or its advisers had themselves interfered with the transcripts.  It follows that any tampering could only have been done by the transcribers (TakeNote).  It is impossible to imagine any possible reason for them to do so.  But even if they did, their conduct is not that of the defendant or its advisers.  Even on the claimant’s own case, it remains entirely unexplained how any discrepancies with the transcripts could constitute misconduct on the part of the first defendant or its advisers.
In any event, Stuart-Smith LJ found that any discrepancies were immaterial.  Even if it were open to me to find otherwise, the claimant has identified no basis for me to do so.  She was not able to identify any alteration relevant to the professional negligence claim, much less relevant to the first defendant’s costs.  She was only able to point to the number of alleged alterations.  (That is all that a purported expert report dated 5 July 2023 relied upon by the claimant by Alphabet Transcription Services ultimately does, even leaving aside that it is not CPR Part 35 compliant, and that no permission to rely upon it has ever been sought, much less granted). However, materiality in this context is qualitative rather than quantitative.
I regret to say that the claimant appears to have developed something of an irrational fixation on the transcripts.  The weight she seeks to attach to the alleged alterations is out of all proportion to their potential significance.  They would have been of marginal significance at most in the original claims.  They were held to be irrelevant to the professional negligence claim.  It is almost impossible to see how they could be of any conceivable relevance to the second defendant’s costs.
As regards the allegations of breach of privilege, again these were very difficult to follow and made no real sense.  The argument as I understood it was that the first defendant was guilty of misconduct by deploying privileged exchanges referred to above which were made in the course of agreeing a reduction the second defendant’s fees in consideration for the claimant agreeing
I assume in the claimant’s favour that these exchanges were privileged.   However, the allegation in my view is hopeless even on that assumption:
Without prejudice privilege does not apply when there is a dispute as to whether an agreement was reached or as to the terms of such agreement.  That is precisely what was in dispute between the claimant and the second defendant before Knowles J.
A claimant bringing a professional negligence claim is normally required to elect to waive legal professional privilege as a requisite for being permitted to do so.
It is clear to me that as a matter of fact any privilege in this case was waived, at least implicitly.  The materials in question were deployed by the second defendant before Knowles J, who relied upon them in his judgement.  There is no suggestion of any protest on the claimant’s behalf that they were privileged.
In any event, this material was deployed solely in relation to the claim against the second defendant.  I cannot see how this can have any possible relevance, by reference to CPR 44.11 or otherwise, the to the costs payable to the first defendant.
I have considered the various other points made by the claimant in support of her arguments here.  I will not lengthen this judgment further by attempting to address each of them.  That would be a disproportionate if not impossible task given the confusing and scattershot manner in which they were made.  Suffice to say that:
They are extremely unclear difficult to understand.
I can see no merit in them.  Indeed in most cases, I cannot even identify their potential relevance.
Even on their own terms, they provide no discernible answer to the matters set out above.
Conclusion and disposal
Subject to the limited exceptions which I have identified, the PoDs are struck out.
Other matters
I will relist to determine the remaining matters in the assessment, including the costs of the assessment and any consequential matters.
As a postscript, I return to my observation at the outset that the time estimate supplied by the first defendant was wholly unrealistic.
I appreciate that such estimates are far from a precise science.  However, any proper consideration of this matter would have revealed that on any view one day was always going to wholly inadequate.
Any meaningful reflection would have revealed that there was no chance of completing all the following within a day: (1) the substantial preliminary point; (2) insofar as that point was dismissed, argument and determination of the disputed costs themselves; (3) argument and determination of the costs of the assessment and other consequential matters.
This especially so given:
The volume of papers.  Even leaving aside documents produced by the claimant, the first defendant’s file as originally lodged ran to 16,856 pages.  A pared down bundle was subsequently lodged, but this still ran to 2,280 pages.  Indeed, the first defendant had applied for the assessment to adjourned because of volume of documents.
That the claimant was acting in person.
That on any view her PoDs were going to seriously hamper the efficient conduct of the assessment.  That indeed was one of the first defendant’s foundational arguments, which I have upheld.
I add here that it would in my view be no answer for the first defendant to say in terms “our preliminary point was irresistible so there was never going to be a full assessment.” If that was the first defendant’s view (and it would have been a reasonable one to hold) it should have made a standalone application for determination of the preliminary point rather than submitting an inadequate time estimate.
Inadequate time estimates can seriously hamper the ability fairly to determine the case in question.  They are also liable to have adverse knock-on effects on other court users and the efficient administration of justice.
It is therefore vital that parties and their advisers properly apply their minds to the practicalities of what a hearing will actually involve and provide realistic time estimates reflecting this.  Faling to do so constitutes a breach of the duty under CPR 1.3 to help the court further the overriding objective.
Failure to do so is liable to result in sanctions.  I flag up in this regard the CPR 44.11 empowers the court to disallow costs to mark its disapproval of unreasonable conduct and pour encourager les autres even if there is no demonstrable effect on the costs inter partes.

REGISTRAR OF APPROVED DRIVING INSTRUCTORS
Respondent
Representation
Appellant: The Appellant appeared on his own behalf.
Respondent: No representative appeared.
Decision: The appeal is Dismissed. The Decision of the Respondent made  on 13 August 2024 is confirmed.
REASONS
This appeal was listed for determination remotely, by CVP, today, at 12.00. The Appellant attended and gave oral evidence.
The Appellant was welcomed to the hearing, the Tribunal introduced to, its independence being emphasised, and the process explained.
The Appellant appealed against a decision of the Respondent dated 13 August 2024, to refuse the Appellant’s application for a further, third, trainee driving instructor licence made on 5 July 2024. His grounds of appeal reiterated the representations made by him to the Respondent, in writing, on 23 July 2024.The decision of the Respondent was made, taking account of those representations, namely, that there was a delay in being offered dates for Part 3 tests, including delays due to strikes at Preston Driving Test Centre in April 2023 and February 2024; the relocation of that test centre and a test date being cancelled by the Respondent; that he had followed all ADI responsibilities; that he had a high regard for all aspects of road safety; had an excellent driving standard and instructional ability; a professional approach and a responsible attitude to the profession and pupils, achieving a pupil driving test pass rate of 75% in the two previous months (compared to an average pass rate of pupils of 56%); that he loved his job as a driving instructor; that he had just renewed his driving instructor insurance at substantial cost; that he did not wish to have wasted his time if he were not to be registered as a fully-qualified ADI and, finally, that he wanted a third trainee licence in order to become an ADI [albeit an applicant to become an ADI did not require a trainee licence at all, much less a third trainee licence, since the purpose of a trainee licence is solely to afford an ADI applicant the opportunity to gain sufficient experience, if required by him, to prepare to pass the Part 3 test and, thereby, become registered as a fully-qualified ADI].
The Respondent decided that no evidence of lost practice time had been provided by the Appellant; that he had received the benefit of two trainee licences, covering a 12 month period from 22 July 2023 to 21 July 2024, for the purpose of gaining sufficient expertise in driving tuition to pass a Part 3 test, a period that was claimed to be more than adequate; that it was not the intention of Parliament that trainee licences be issued for as long as it takes an applicant to pass their Part 3 test and that the trainee licence system could not be an alternative to registration as a fully-qualified Approved Driving Instructor (‘ADI’); that it was not necessary to hold a trainee licence to undertake a Part 3 test; that refusal of a trainee licence application was not a bar to taking a Part 3 test and that the Appellant’s second trainee licence remained in force until the determination of this appeal [that is, until this decision is promulgated], as he had applied for a third trainee licence before the expiry of his second trainee licence (that, in practical terms, meant he had the benefit of a trainee licence for more than 18 months).
In their Response dated 9 September 2024, the Respondent advised, in addition,  that the Appellant had failed his first attempt at a Part 3 test on 2 September 2024 and had a second attempt booked that was on hold pending the Appellant being offered a test date; that if the Appellant wished to further prepare to undertake a further attempt at passing a Part 3 test (up to the maximum permitted number of attempts), he could, as an alternative, undertake a training course, or study or practice with an ADI or provide unpaid tuition, alternatives for which precedents existed.
In his oral evidence, the Appellant confirmed his acceptance that an ADI applicant could not expect to be granted a trainee licence indefinitely and that it was not necessary to hold a trainee licence in order to take a Part 3 test and that refusal of a trainee licence was not a bar to taking a Part 3 test. However, the Appellant pointed out that he had pupils whose driving tests were pending, quite apart from the delays in getting dates to undertake Part 3 tests. He also referred to the substantial financial outlay he had incurred, and continued to incur, in being a provisional ADI, that were up-front costs, including training costs. He strongly expressed a view that if the Respondent had provided greater clarity and fully advised him as to the potential wait on his appeal being heard, he may have been able to do something in respect of such pupils. He confirmed that he had stopped taking new pupils from when the Respondent issued their decision and he had to take on a second job, suffering a 50% drop in income from driving instruction. On being asked about being willing to go to a driving test centre other than that in Preston, he pointed out that the same small, limited number of examiners covered around 14 test centres.  The Appellant stated that he needed a third trainee licence to allow him to meet the interests of his existing pupils [but this could only be an issue if the Appellant declined, in the meantime at least, to provide unpaid tuition]. He also confirmed that he had failed his second attempt to pass his Part 3 test on 4 December 2024, an outcome that he intended to appeal to the Magistrates’ Court, as both he and his pupil had felt stressed and harassed by an alleged harsh approach of the examiner. He confirmed, too, that a third, and final, attempt to pass his Part 3 test was booked for 4 March 2025 – approximately five weeks’ time.
In conclusion, the Appellant again expressed the view that the Respondent should make it clear to ADI applicants what could happen process-wise.
This appeal concerns a decision of the Respondent to refuse the Appellant’s application for a further, third, ADI trainee licence. The powers of the Tribunal in determining this appeal are set out ins.131 of the Road Traffic Act 1988 (‘the Act’). In determining the appeal, the Tribunal may make such order as it thinks fit, standing in the shoes of the Respondent, considering the decision afresh on the evidence available to it, giving appropriate weight to the Respondent’s reasons for their decision. Theburden of proof in satisfying the Tribunal that the Respondent’s decision was wrong rests with theAppellant.
The essential basis of the Respondent’s decision was that the Appellant had been provided, under two trainee licences, more than adequate time to gain sufficient experience to pass his Part 3 test and that no evidence of lost practice time had been provided by the Appellant.
An appeal to this Tribunal against the Respondent’s decision proceeds as an appeal by way ofre-hearing, that is, the Tribunal makes a fresh decision on the evidence before it. The Tribunal must givesuch weight as it considers appropriate to the Respondent’s reasons for its decision as the Respondent is the regulatory authority tasked by Parliament with making such decisions. The Tribunal does not conduct a proceduralreview of the Respondent’s decision-making process.
In reaching my decision I have taken into account all of the evidence and submissions received, written and oral, and considered all of the circumstances relevant to this appeal.
There was little or no dispute as to the material facts of this case.
Accordingly, the appeal isdismissed.

Approved Judgment
This judgment was handed down remotely at 10.30am on 4 February 2025 by circulation to the parties or their representatives by e-mail and by release to the National Archives
(see eg https://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2022/1169.html).
Lord Justice Zacaroli:
The question in this appeal is whether the claim brought by EE Limited (“EE”) against Virgin Mobile Telecoms Limited (“VM”) is excluded as being one “in respect of … anticipated profits”, on the proper interpretation of that phrase in clause 34.5(a) of the contract between them.
On VM’s application to strike out the claim, or for reverse summary judgment, Mrs Justice Joanna Smith held that the claim fell within the exclusion clause. EE appeals with the permission of Coulson LJ granted on 5 December 2023. For the reasons set out below, I consider the judge’s conclusion was correct.
Background
EE’s claim arises out of a Telecommunications Supply Agreement dated 28 August 2013 (the “TSA”).
I take the following summary of the background from paragraphs 2 to 19 of the judge’s careful and considered judgment.
EE is one of four Mobile Network Operators (“MNOs”) in the UK. It owns and operates its own physical radio access network. VM, being a Mobile Virtual Network Operator, did not have its own radio access network so had to contract with one or more of the MNOs to make use of their networks.
Pursuant to the TSA, EE was required to provide VM with various services, essentially comprising access to its mobile network, to enable VM’s customers to be provided with 2G, 3G and 4G mobile services.
Pursuant to clause 10 of the TSA, VM agreed that, for the duration of the “Exclusive Period” (which initially ran until 31 March 2018, but was later amended to run until 31 December 2021 or, in the event of an extension of the term of the TSA, until 31 December 2026), it would use EE’s radio access network exclusively for the provision of such services to its customers. In consideration for the services provided by EE, VM agreed to pay the charges set out in schedule 3 to the TSA. These depended on the level of usage of the EE network by VM’s customers. The TSA contained a Minimum Revenue Commitment (which VM had exceeded at all material times).
In its original form, the TSA did not make provision for 5G services. An amendment dated 9 December 2016 provided for potential agreement between EE and VM in relation to the provision of 5G services using EE’s network. In the absence of agreement, VM would be entitled to provide 5G services to its customers from a network owned by another MNO. Clause 5B.2 provides that, where a customer of VM is provided with 5G services sourced from an alternative MNO, then “VM shall also be entitled to provide such customers of VM with 2G, 3G and 4G/LTE services sourced from such alternative supplier”.  At the same time, the exclusivity provision was varied, so that it became subject to the exception in clause 5B.2.
EE launched its 5G service in May 2019. In the absence of agreement with EE, VM subsequently entered into an agreement with Vodafone for the supply of 5G services and, from around January 2021, began migrating customers from the EE network to the Vodafone network.
VM was entitled to do this, provided it acted in accordance with clause 5B.2. EE contends, however, that VM has acted in breach of the exclusivity obligation in clause 10, by migrating customers to Vodafone outside the parameters of clause 5B.2 and/or adding new non-5G customers to the Vodafone network, even though those customers were only provided with 2G-4G mobile services.
EE’s claim for loss and damage, according to its particulars of claim, is represented by: “the revenue [EE] would have received from [VM] under the terms of the TSA for the 2G-4G services that each of [VM’s] customers would have consumed had they remained or been added to the EE network rather than migrated or added to the Vodafone network or O2 or VOLT network”. It estimates its loss in this respect at around £24,635,684.
VM denies that it acted in breach of the exclusivity obligation, but in any event contends that the loss and damage claimed is in truth a claim in respect of “anticipated profits”, and as such falls within the exclusion contained in clause 34.5(a) of the TSA. The construction of this clause lies at the heart of the appeal, and it is helpful to set it out in the context of the rest of clause 34, which is headed “Limitations of Liability”:
Except as set out in Clauses 34.2 or 34.6, the Parties agree and acknowledge that neither Party shall be liable to the other under this Agreement (including any liability of a Party arising out of any indemnification of the other Party specifically provided for under this Agreement) to the extent that the aggregate liability of that Party (for all claims made under this Agreement), in any Annual Period would exceed the lesser of:
fifteen per cent (15%) of the total Customer Network Spend paid or payable by VM in the twelve month period preceding the event giving rise to liability (and in the first year of the Term, fifteen per cent (15%) of the total charges (excluding interconnect charges) paid under the Telecommunications Supply Agreement in the twelve (12) month period prior to the Effective Date); or
ten million pounds (£10 million).
In addition to any other exceptions or exclusions set out in this Clause 34, the Parties agree that the limitation of liability set out in Clause 34.1 shall not apply to:
VM’s liability to pay any Charges and any other sums payable under Clauses 17 and 39;
EE’s liability to pay any revenue that EE is obliged to pass through to VM under this Agreement or other amounts which have been agreed to be payable by EE to VM from time to time pursuant to the Agreement Change Control Process and documented in accordance with that process; or
any liability for damage or loss arising from reckless or wilful misconduct or gross negligence of either Party, its employees, agents or permitted sub-contractors (or any other person for which it is responsible for performance or conduct).
For the purposes of Clause 34.2(c); and in the case of acts or omissions of EE, “wilful misconduct” will include any intentional act by EE resulting in any discontinuance, withdrawal or refusal to supply any Service to VM contrary to EE’s obligations under this Agreement, subject to the following additional requirements:
VM promptly notifies EE in writing of the Service which it believes has been discontinued, withdrawn or not supplied, its reasons for its belief, its objection to the discontinuance, withdrawal or refusal to supply that Service and of VM's intention to pursue remedies pursuant to this Clause 34.3;
the discontinuance, withdrawal or refusal to supply relates to a Service that is used by VM to deliver services to Customers that result in Customer revenues in excess of seven and one half per cent (7.5%) of VM’s total Customer Revenues…for the twelve (12) month period preceding the discontinuance, withdrawal or refusal to supply the Service in question…;
VM applies at the first practicable time for interim or other urgent equitable relief in response to the discontinuance, withdrawal or refusal to supply the Service in question, and provides notice of such application to EE without undue delay; and in any action claiming damages continues to claim equitable relief and the re-instatement of the affected Service as its primary remedy, with damages claimed only to the extent that equitable relief is not granted or only in respect of losses suffered by VM in the period from the initial discontinuance, withdrawal or refusal to supply the Service in question until re-instatement of the affected Service pursuant to the equitable relief actually obtained.
Neither Party shall be liable to the other for any loss which is not directly foreseeable or which does not arise directly from the performance of this Agreement and thus neither Party shall be liable for any indirect or consequential or special or incidental loss whatsoever.
Except for any damages claims by VM pursuant to Clause 34.2(c), to which Clause 34.3 applies (which EE acknowledges may include claims of damages for loss of profits), and for no other damage claims whatsoever, neither Party shall have liability to the other in respect of:
anticipated profits; or
anticipated savings.
Neither Party excludes or limits liability:
to the extent that such liability arises from death or personal injury of any person…; or
for a fraudulent misrepresentation by a Party or its employees; or
for direct physical damage to or physical loss of the property of the other…
Except as expressly stipulated in this Agreement, any representations, warranties, terms and conditions (whether implied by law, custom or otherwise) are hereby expressly excluded to the extent permitted by law and the provisions of this Clause 34 specify the entire liability of either Party under or in connection with this Agreement whether arising in contract, tort (including negligence) or otherwise.”
The judge’s judgment
The judge first recited the test to be applied on a strike out/summary judgment application and the approach to be taken to construction, in particular the construction of exclusion clauses. No issue is taken with any of this on appeal, and I need do no more than quote or summarise the judge’s judgment on these points.
At §20 to §22, the judge recited the well-known passage dealing with the approach to strike out or summary judgment applications from Lewison J’s judgment in Easyair Ltd v Opal Telecom Ltd [2009] EWHC 339 (Ch), at §15.
At §26, she set out the proper approach to the construction of contracts generally, citing, among others, Sir Geoffrey Vos C in Lamesa Investments Ltd v Cynergy Bank Ltd [2020] EWCA Civ 821, at §18:
“The court construes the relevant words of a contract in their documentary, factual and commercial context, assessed in the light of (i) the natural and ordinary meaning of the provision being construed, (ii) any other relevant provisions of the contract being construed, (iii) the overall purpose of the provision being construed and the contract or order in which it is contained, (iv) the facts and circumstances known or assumed by the parties at the time that the document was executed, and (v) commercial common sense, but (vi) disregarding subjective evidence of any party’s intentions – see Arnold v Britton [2015] UKSC 36, [2016] 1 All ER 1, [2015] AC 1619 per Lord Neuberger PSC at paragraph 15 and the earlier cases he refers to in that paragraph;
A court can only consider facts or circumstances known or reasonably available to both parties that existed at the time that the contract or order was made – see Arnold v. Britton (ibid.) per Lord Neuberger PSC at paragraph 20;
In arriving at the true meaning and effect of a contract or order, the departure point in most cases will be the language used by the parties because (a) the parties have control over the language they use in a contract or consent order and (b) the parties must have been specifically focussing on the issue covered by the disputed clause or clauses when agreeing the wording of that provision – see Arnold v. Britton (ibid.) per Lord Neuberger PSC at paragraph 17;
Where the parties have used unambiguous language, the court must apply it – see Rainy Sky SA v Kookmin Bank [2011] UKSC 50, [2012] 1 All ER (Comm) 1, [2012] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 34 per Lord Clarke JSC at paragraph 23;
Where the language used by the parties is unclear the court can properly depart from its natural meaning where the context suggests that an alternative meaning more accurately reflects what a reasonable person with the parties’ actual and presumed knowledge would conclude the parties had meant by the language they used but that does not justify the court searching for drafting infelicities in order to facilitate a departure from the natural meaning of the language used – see Arnold v. Britton (ibid.) per Lord Neuberger PSC at paragraph 18;
If there are two possible constructions, the court is entitled to prefer the construction which is consistent with business common sense and to reject the other – see Rainy Sky SA v. Kookmin Bank (ibid.) per Lord Clarke JSC at paragraph 2 – but commercial common sense is relevant only to the extent of how matters would have been perceived by reasonable people in the position of the parties, as at the date that the contract was made – see Arnold v. Britton (ibid.) per Lord Neuberger PSC at paragraph 19;
In striking a balance between the indications given by the language and those arising contextually, the court must consider the quality of drafting of the clause and the agreement in which it appears – see Wood v Capita Insurance Services Ltd [2017] UKSC 24, [2018] 1 All ER (Comm) 51, [2017] AC 1173 per Lord Hodge JSC at paragraph 11. Sophisticated, complex agreements drafted by skilled professionals are likely to be interpreted principally by textual analysis unless a provision lacks clarity or is apparently illogical or incoherent– see Wood v Capita Insurance Services Ltd (ibid.) per Lord Hodge JSC at paragraph 13; and
A court should not reject the natural meaning of a provision as correct simply because it appears to be a very imprudent term for one of the parties to have agreed, even ignoring the benefit of wisdom of hindsight, because it is not the function of a court when interpreting an agreement to relieve a party from a bad bargain – see Arnold v. Britton (ibid.) per Lord Neuberger PSC at paragraph 20 and Wood v. Capita Insurance Services Limited (ibid.) per Lord Hodge JSC at paragraph 11”.
At §27, the judge summarised the approach to be taken specifically in relation to the interpretation of exclusion clauses, as follows:
As for the approach to be taken to the interpretation of exclusion clauses:
The exercise of construing an exclusion clause must be undertaken in accordance with the ordinary methods of contractual interpretation. Commercial parties are free to make their own bargains and to allocate risks as they think fit; exclusion and limitation clauses are an integral part of pricing and risk allocation. The principle of freedom of contract requires the court to respect and give effect to the parties’ agreement (see Interactive E-Solutions JLT v O3b Africa Ltd [2018] EWCA Civ 62 at [14] per Lewison LJ and Triple Point Technology Inc v PTT Public Co Ltd [2021] AC 1148 at [108] per Lord Leggatt with whom Lord Burrows agreed).
However, a vital part of the setting in which parties contract is a framework of rights and obligations established by the common law. In construing an exclusion clause, the court will start from the assumption that in the absence of clear words the parties did not intend to derogate from those normal rights and obligations. (Modern Engineering (Bristol) Ltd v Gilbert Ash (Northern) Ltd [1974] AC 689 per Viscount Diplock at page 717H; Triple Point at [108]-[110]; Soteria v IBM at [34] and Sara & Hossein Holdings Ltd v Blacks Outdoor Retail Ltd [2023] 1 WLR 575 per Lord Hamblen at [48]).
The more valuable the right, the clearer the language of the exclusion clause will need to be if it is to be given effect (Stocznia Gdynia v Gearbulk Holdings [2009] EWCA Civ 75, per Moore-Bick LJ at [23]; Triple Point at [110] and Soteria v IBM at [35], [37] and [60]).
Unclear words will not suffice; if linguistic, contextual and purposive analysis do not disclose an answer to the question with sufficient clarity, any ambiguity or lack of clarity must be resolved against the party seeking to exclude liability (Dairy Containers Ltd v Tasman Orient Line CV (The Tasman Discoverer) [2004] UKPC 22 at [12], per Lord Bingham of Cornhill and Nobahar-Cookson v Hut Group Ltd [2016] EWCA Civ 128 at [16]-[19] and [21] per Briggs LJ).
However, “[i]n commercial contracts negotiated between business-men capable of looking after their own interests and of deciding how risks inherent in the performance of various kinds of contract can be most economically borne…it is…wrong to place a strained construction upon words in an exclusion clause which are clear and fairly susceptible of one meaning only…” (Photo Production Ltd v Securicor Transport Ltd [1980] AC 827 per Lord Diplock at page 851 and Fujitsu at [49]).
Notwithstanding (a)-(e) above, an exemption clause will not normally be interpreted as extending to a situation which would defeat the main object of the contract or create a commercial absurdity, notwithstanding the literal meaning of the words used. This is a context in which it is open to the court to strain to avoid a particular construction, rather than one which requires ambiguity on a fair reading before the principle comes into play, because it is inherently unlikely that the parties intended that the clause should have so wide an ambit as in effect to deprive one party’s stipulations of all contractual force such that the contract becomes ‘a mere declaration of intent’ (Kudos Catering (UK) Ltd v Manchester Central Convention Complex Ltd [2013] EWCA Civ 38, per Tomlinson LJ at [19] citing from the speech of Lord Wilberforce in Suisse Atlantique Societe d’Armement Maritime SA v NV Rotterdamsche Kolen Centrale [1967] 1 AC 361 at pages 431-432; CNM Estates (Tolworth Tower) Ltd v VeCREF I Sarl [2020] 2 CLC 243, per Foxton J at [33]).
However, even in this context, where language is fairly susceptible of one meaning only, that meaning must be attributed to it unless “the meaning is repugnant to the contract” (see Kudos at [20]). It is a principle which “should be seen as one of last resort and there is authority that it applies only in cases where the effect of the clause is to relieve one party from all liability for breach of any of the obligations which he has purported to undertake: see Great North Eastern Rly Ltd v Avon Insurance plc [2001] EWCA Civ 780, [2001] 2 ALL ER (Comm) 526…Only in such a case could it be said that the contract amounted to nothing more than a mere declaration of intent” (Transocean Drilling UK Ltd v Providence Resources plc (The GSF Arctic III) [2016] EWCA Civ 372, per Moore-Bick LJ at [27]).
The judge then dealt with the two principal issues presented to her. First, whether the court should “grasp the nettle” and determine the true construction of clause 34.5(a) at this stage, or should delay doing so until trial. Second, whether on the true construction of clause 34.5(a), it excluded EE’s claim.
On the first question, the judge concluded that: (1) the true nature of EE’s claim was either a question of law or a mixed question of fact and law, in circumstances where all the necessary facts were before the court; (2) it was fanciful to suggest that EE’s claim was anything other than a claim for loss of profit; (3) the question of the true construction of clause 34.5(a) is a short point of construction, largely dependent on an analysis of the terms of the TSA; (4) the court had before it all the evidence necessary for the proper determination of that question of construction; (5) there was no obvious conflict of fact on any issue and no reason to believe that a fuller investigation into the facts of the case would materially add to, or alter, the evidence available to the trial judge; and (6) there was no other reason why the court should decline to decide the point.
On the second question, the judge concluded that on the true construction of clause 34.5(a), any liability of VM for damages for the unlawful diversion of its customers to alternative networks fell within the exclusion. The phrase “anticipated profits” was susceptible of one meaning only; it sought to exclude damages claims for loss of profits of any kind which it was foreseeable would be made by either party.
For this purpose, there was no difference between “anticipated profits” and “lost profits”. That was reinforced by the fact that clause 34.5 used the phrases interchangeably, in carving out claims by VM brought under clause 34.2(c), “which EE acknowledges may include claims for loss of profits”.
The judge found that her conclusion as to the natural meaning of the words was supported by the surrounding circumstances, including the fact that: the TSA is a bespoke, lengthy and detailed contract; detailed consideration had gone into the risks and rewards of each party; clause 34 itself was a detailed regime including a liability cap and various exclusions of liability, clearly intended to form part of the risk allocation exercise between the parties; and the clause applied equally to both parties, save for the specific carve-out in relation to the specific claims by VM identified in clause 34.2(c) and 34.3.
While the judge had regard to the point that clear words are needed to rebut the starting presumption that parties do not intend to abandon remedies arising by operation of law, the language of clause 34.5 is clear and unequivocal.
EE relied on certain previous cases in which an exclusion of claims for loss of profits had been construed as not extending to claims for diminution in price, or as limited to claims for loss of profits outside of the contract. I deal with these cases in more detail below. The judge found them to be of no assistance, as they showed no more than that those words may be differently construed depending on their contractual context.
Before the judge it was contended by EE that, on VM’s construction, the exclusivity clause would be deprived of all contractual force and would be reduced to a mere statement of intent. Reliance was placed on Kudos Catering (UK) Ltd v Manchester Central Convention Complex [2013] EWCA Civ 38; [2013] Lloyd’s Rep 270. In that case, the claimant was appointed exclusive provider of catering services at the defendant’s venue for a period of five years. The claimant contended that the defendant had repudiated the agreement and claimed damages for the lost profits that it would have earned during the remaining 20 months of the five-year term. The defendant contended that this claim was barred by a clause which excluded liability of the defendant to the claimant (but not the other way round):
“…in contract, tort (including negligence) or otherwise for any loss of goodwill, business, revenue or profits, anticipated savings or wasted expenditure (whether reasonably foreseeable or not) or indirect or consequential loss suffered by the Contractor or any third party in relation to this Agreement…”
The Court of Appeal rejected that contention, holding that the defendant’s construction of the clause would reduce the contract to a mere “declaration of intent”. In order to avoid that uncommercial result, Tomlinson LJ (with whom Laws LJ and McCombe LJ agreed) construed the clause as relating “…to defective performance of the agreement, not to a refusal or to a disabling inability to perform it”. Had the parties intended to provide an exclusion of all financial loss in favour of the company, but not the contractor, in the event of a refusal or inability of the company to perform, that would have been spelt out clearly.
The judge distinguished Kudos, first because the so-called “statement of intent rule” was of little assistance where the wording of the contract was plain (citing Fujitsu Services v IBM United Kingdom [2014] EWHC 752 (TCC) and Transocean Drilling UK Ltd v Providence Resources plc (The GSF Arctic III) [2016] EWCA Civ 372), second, because VM’s construction would not exclude claims in wasted expenditure or for injunctive relief and, third, because EE remained contractually entitled to the payment of the Minimum Revenue Commitment.

EE’s first ground of appeal relates to the judge’s conclusion that its claim is to be characterised as one for lost profits. It asserts that “the judge was wrong to hold that EE had not provided the Services, insofar as [VM] had migrated its customers to another network” and that the judge should have held, or proceeded on the assumption, that EE provided the services. Had she done so, then she should have held that the claim is one for the diminution in the price payable under the TSA, and not for lost profits.
The second ground of appeal is simply that the judge was wrong to construe clause 34.5 as barring the damages pleaded by EE.
Ground 1: the characterisation of EE’s claim
Mr Zellick KC, who appeared with Ms Hughes for VM, characterised EE’s claim in this case as “an expectation loss claim for loss of profits”.
Mr Patton KC, who appeared for EE, accepted that EE’s claim in this case is based on the expectation measure of loss, the classic formulation of which is to be found in Robinson v Harman (1848) 1 Exch 850; [1843-60] All ER Rep 383, per Parke B at p.855:
“the rule of the common law is, that where a party sustains a loss by reason of a breach of contract, he is, so far as money can do it, to be placed in the same situation, with respect to damages, as if the contract had been performed.”
Had VM not, in breach of the exclusivity obligation, diverted customers to the networks of other MNOs, then EE would have received charges under the contract, measured by reference to the use those customers made of EE’s services. Mr Patton disputed, however, that it is a claim for loss of profits. He contended that it is to be characterised as a claim for diminution in price, and that it is well established that such a claim is not to be regarded as a claim for lost profits.
That submission was primarily based on two earlier cases involving salvage.
The first is an unreported decision of Clarke J in Alexander C Tsavliris & Sons Maritime Company v OSA Marine Limited, 1996-January-19 (“The Herdentor”). In that case OSA, the owner of the tug ‘Herdentor’, provided it to Tsavliris to enable Tsavliris to perform a contract of salvage entered into with the owners of the Atlas Pride on the terms of a Lloyds Open Form Salvage Agreement 1990 (“LOF 1990”). Tsavliris claimed that OSA withdrew Herdentor before the salvage services had been completed. The essence of its claim was that, but for OSA’s breach, (1) the total sum awarded under the LOF 1990 would have been greater and (2) Tsavliris’ share of that award would have been greater, because Herdentor would have contributed more to the overall salvage operation, whereas in the event Tsavliris’ sub-contractor, Pentow, had carried out a greater share of the work and thus received an increased share of the award.
OSA contended that the claim fell within an exclusion clause in its contract with Tsavliris, which read:
“Save for the provisions of Clauses 11, 12, 13 and 16 neither the Tugowner nor the Hirer shall be liable to the other party for loss of profit, loss of use, loss of production or any other indirect or consequential damage for any reason whatsoever.”
Counsel for Tsavliris submitted that the true position was that “Tsavliris have received less money as payment for their services then they would have done. It has therefore in effect cost them more. It is as if they have suffered a diminution in price which they were to receive for the salvage services.” Clarke J accepted that submission, noting that whether the reduction in the amount of the award involved less profit than would otherwise have been made depends on whether the services were in fact profitable: “It may be that they were, but it seems to me that it is somewhat artificial to treat Tsavliris’ claim as a claim for loss of profit.” He added that counsel for OSA had conceded that if Tsavliris had chartered another tug at a higher cost, a claim in respect of that higher cost would not be a claim for loss of profit. He considered that concession was rightly made because otherwise the effect of the exclusion clause would be that the hirer was entitled to no damages at all where the tugowner withdrew the tug in repudiatory breach of the agreement. Clarke J thought it most unlikely that the draftsman intended to permit that measure of loss but to exclude the loss which Tsavliris had in fact incurred.
Although he considered it was unnecessary to do so, Clarke J addressed – and accepted – a further submission by counsel for Tsavliris to the effect that, because the phrase “loss of profits” was followed by the phrase “or other indirect or consequential damage”, it followed that it was only indirect loss of profit that was excluded.
The second case relied on by Mr Patton is Ease Faith Ltd v Leonis Marine Management Ltd [2006] EWHC 232 (Comm); [2006] 1 Lloyds Rep 673 (“Ease Faith”). Ease Faith entered into a contract to sell the vessel Kent Reliant to Chinese purchasers for scrap. Ease Faith then contracted with a tugowner, Leonis, to have the Kent Reliant towed to Zhanjiagang. A dispute arose between Ease Faith and Leonis, resulting in the late delivery of the Kent Reliant. Ease Faith sued Leonis for damages, including (1) additional pilot and escort charges arising from the delay; (2) the reduction in the purchase price of the Kent Reliant and (3) loss of interest arising from the delay in receipt of the purchase price.
Leonis contended that the claim was excluded by clause 18.3 of the contract which was in the same terms as the relevant clause in The Herdentor. Andrew Smith J, at §143-144, however, held that the claim fell outside the exclusion clause, which he considered was “directed at protecting the tug owner from a claim for loss of productive use of the tow and the hirer from a claim of loss of productive use of the tug.” He was encouraged in that view by the decision of Clarke J in The Herdentor. He also considered, separately, that because of the inclusion of the word “other” before the phrase “indirect or consequential loss”, loss of profits was intended to mean only indirect loss of profits, although he noted (at §149) that he did not need to put his decision on that basis.
Neither of these cases establishes any principle of wider application than the construction of the particular contract in issue. The relevant clauses were materially different to the clause in issue here, and appeared in different contexts. The judge in each case reached his conclusion applying normal principles of construction. Neither judge purported to identify any established meaning of “loss of profits”, or determine that an exclusion of “loss of profits” cannot cover a claim for “diminution in price”. These are in any event not terms of art, but must take their meaning from the context in which they are used.
This serves to demonstrate that the debate underlying the first ground of appeal – whether EE’s claim is for “loss of profits” or “diminution in price” – is an arid one. The only question is whether EE’s claim is one “in respect of anticipated profits” within the meaning of clause 34.5(a).
I nevertheless deal briefly with the premise of the first ground, because I consider its criticism of the judge’s reasoning is misplaced. EE contends that the judge, in distinguishing this case from the salvage cases, based herself on the flawed conclusion that EE had suffered the diversion of customers “to whom it would otherwise have been providing a service”. That is wrong, says EE, because its services were provided to, and only to, VM. I reject that contention. I have little doubt, reading the judgment as a whole, that the judge understood well how the agreement worked, i.e. that in contractual terms EE provided its services to VM, but that in practical terms its services were made available for the benefit of VM’s customers. As Mr Zellick pointed out, the detailed services set out in Schedule 2 to the TSA are there described in terms of enabling customers (of VM) to initiate or receive calls, texts and voicemails.
Ground 2: the true construction of clause 34.5(a)
The core issue between the parties is whether a claim in respect of anticipated profits means, on the true construction of clause 34.5(a), a claim for loss of profit other than expectation loss. Put another way, whether it is something other than the loss that consists in the value to EE of the contractual performance which would have been provided by VM but for the breach of contract.
Mr Zellick submitted that the judge was right for the reasons she gave. EE’s claim for expectation loss is a claim in respect of the additional profit which EE anticipated making from the contract, measured as the additional charges that VM would have paid but for its breach of the exclusivity obligation, to the extent that such charges would have exceeded the cost to EE in providing the services in respect of the diverted customers. (EE contends, in fact, that it would not have incurred any additional cost in the event that its services had been used by the diverted customers. That, however, is not relevant to the analysis. If true, it would simply mean that EE’s lost profit was the same as its lost revenue.)
EE disputes that. Its contentions can be distilled into three over-arching points.
First, on the judge’s construction, exclusion of liability for loss of profits is capable of obliterating virtually every claim by the victim of a breach of contract to recover their expectation loss, and the courts have repeatedly held that not every claim for expectation losses falls within such a clause (citing The Herdentor and Ease Faith). That view is said to be supported by the decision of Cooke J in Glencore Energy v Cirrus Oil [2014] 1 All ER (Comm) 513, and by that of HHJ Keyser QC in University of Wales v London College of Business [2015] EWHC 1280 (QB).
Second, the wording of the clause, and of other aspects of the TSA, favours the narrower construction that “anticipated profits” means profits that were anticipated to be earned outside of the contract.
Third, the commercial consequences of the judge’s construction – in particular that EE is left without a meaningful remedy for breach of the exclusivity obligation – should lead the court to give a narrower construction to the clause (citing Kudos Catering (UK) v Manchester Central Convention Complex [2013] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 270).
Before turning to the arguments in detail, I make the following preliminary points.
First, as Andrew Smith J pointed out in Ease Faith (above), at §144, there are few, if any, losses suffered by a commercial concern that could not be described as amounting to or producing a reduction in the profits of the company generally or of the particular venture in which the company was engaged, but it does not necessarily follow that – where it can be shown that a reduction in profits is caused by the defendant’s breach – that will fall within an exclusion of “loss of profits” in the particular contract between them.
The salvage cases, and other cases on which EE relies as discussed below, demonstrate that depending on the context, an exclusion of liability for loss of profits can be intended to refer to something other than the loss of profit inherent in the failure to perform the primary obligations under the contract.
Second, on the other hand, a claim for expectation loss is undoubtedly capable of being described as one for lost profits: see, for example, Omak Maritime v Mamola Challenger Shipping [2010] EWHC 2026 (Comm); [2011] 2 All ER (Comm) 155, at §34, citing the judgment of the High Court of Australia in Commonwealth of Australia v Amann Aviation Pty Ltd (1991) 174 CLR 64, per Mason CJ and Dawson J at pp.80-82:
“In the ordinary course of commercial dealings, a party supplying goods or rendering services will enter into a contract with a view to securing a profit, that is to say, that party will expect a certain margin of gain to be achieved in addition to the recouping of any expenses reasonably incurred by it in the discharge of its contractual obligations. It is for this reason that expectation damages are often described as damages for loss of profits. Damages recoverable as lost profits are constituted by the combination of expenses justifiably incurred by a plaintiff in the discharge of contractual obligations and any amount by which gross receipts would have exceeded those expenses. This second amount is the net profit.”
Third, it is important in construing the TSA not to focus too narrowly on the particular breach that is alleged to have occurred in this case. Breach of the exclusivity obligation is just one way among many in which a breach of the TSA might have occurred. The exclusion of liability in respect of anticipated profits applies to all of them, and it must have the same meaning whichever breach gives rise to a claim in damages.
The case law relied on by EE
I have already explained why little assistance is gained from the two salvage cases. The same applies to the other cases relied on by EE, none of which purports to lay down any legal principle.
Glencore Energy involved a claim under ss.50(2) and (3) of the Sale of Goods Act 1979 for damages for non-acceptance in relation to a contract for the sale of crude oil. The contract contained an exclusion of liability for, among other things, loss of anticipated profits.
It was contended by the buyer that, pursuant to the prima facie rule applicable to claims under ss.50(2) and (3), the seller’s loss was to be ascertained as the difference between the contract price and the market price at the time when the goods ought to have been accepted, and that is properly construed as a claim for loss of profits (to be contrasted with a claim for out of pocket expenditure, or physical damage caused by a quality problem with the cargo).
Cooke J rejected that argument, at §98, on the basis that the “contract/market price differential is not a computation of lost profit”, but was designed to compensate the seller for the loss of the bargain with the buyer. He commented that “no one who understands the way in which the 1979 Act works, would refer to this measure of loss as “lost profits” or “loss of anticipated profits””.
Outside the sale of goods context, however, as the passage cited above from Omak Maritime demonstrates, expectation loss is often referred to as damages for loss of profits.
Cooke J went on to contrast what he did regard as “lost profit”, namely:
“the difference between the total net cost to the seller of acquiring the goods and bringing them to market on the one hand and the net sale price that would have been achieved on the other.”
In fact, that is not a description of lost profits, but of the way in which the seller’s loss or profit overall from the transaction would be calculated. Such anticipated profit (or loss) in that wider sense would not be relevant in calculating damages against the buyer (save to the extent that the cost to the seller of acquiring the goods and bringing them to market might be recoverable as wasted expenditure, subject to a cap equal to the amount of the expectation loss, as explained in Omak Maritime (above) at §45). However much the seller paid in order to acquire the goods and bring them to market, the amount arrived at in respect of its overall loss of profit, i.e. the change to its profit arising from the buyer’s breach, would always be the same as the difference between the contract price and the market price at the time of repudiation by the buyer, as shown by the following example:
If S sourced the goods for £40, sold them to B for £100, and re-sold them in the market on B’s breach for £80, its overall loss of profit is the difference between the anticipated profit (£60) and the actual profit (£40), i.e. £20. That, being the difference between contract/market price, is its expectation loss.
If on the other hand, S sourced the goods for £90, sold them to B for £100, and re-sold them on B’s breach for £80, its overall loss of profit is the difference between its anticipated profit (£10) and the loss that it made (-£10), i.e. £20, which is, again, its expectation loss, being the difference between the contract/market price.
The decision of Adrian Beltrami QC, sitting as a deputy High Court judge in Galtrade Ltd v BP Oil International Ltd (The “Pioneer”) [2021] EWHC 1796 (Comm); [1022] 1 Lloyds Rep 129, does not take matters any further. It was another sale of goods case. The clause in question excluded liability “in respect of any indirect or consequential losses or expenses including if and to the extent that they might not otherwise constitute indirect or consequential losses or expenses, loss of anticipated profits, plant shut-down or reduced production, loss of power generation, blackouts or electrical shut-down or reduction, goodwill, use, market reputation, business receipts or contracts of commercial opportunities, whether or not foreseeable.” The claimant’s claim was for wasted expenditure. The defendant contended that this was nevertheless in substance a claim for “anticipated profits”. The judge unsurprisingly rejected that argument. One reason for doing so was that he considered the clause was limited to what he called “conventional claims for loss of profit”, noting that the analysis was consistent with the passages from Cooke J’s decision in Glencore to which I have referred above.
The other case relied on by EE is University of Wales v London College of Business [2015] EWHC 1280 (QB), in which HHJ Keyser QC concluded that an exclusion clause of liability for “loss of any anticipated or future business, revenue, goodwill or profit” applied only to losses of profit outside the agreement. That was mainly because the clause would otherwise have the “remarkable effect” of negating the primary commercial benefit for each party. The case involved the construction of a different clause, in a different contractual context, and laid down no principle of wider application.
Accordingly, I do not accept, on the basis of the cases cited by EE, that the courts have “repeatedly held” that not every claim for expectation loss would fall within such a clause, or that these cases established, let alone clearly established, that loss based on diminution of price is not a loss of profits.
For what it might be worth, VM pointed to authorities the other way, in particular the decision of Carr J (as she then was) in Fujitsu (above). In that case, IBM was obliged, by its contract with Fujitsu, to sub-contract to Fujitsu the performance of certain services IBM was obliged to perform under its main contract with the DVLA, and to pay Fujitsu for those services. Fujitsu claimed that IBM had breached that obligation, and claimed damages in the net amount it would have received from IBM if it had not been deprived of the services IBM would otherwise have provided.
The contract contained an exclusion clause to the effect that, with certain exceptions, “Neither party shall be liable to the other under this Sub-Contract for loss of profits, revenue, business, goodwill, indirect or consequential loss or damage…”.
Carr J held, having regard in particular to the clear and unambiguous wording, the detailed provisions of the contract, prepared with the benefit of experienced commercial solicitors, and the fact that the exclusion clause was for the benefit of both parties, that Fujitsu’s claim was excluded by that clause. She also observed (at §77) that – given the obviousness of the point – one would expect it to be made clear if the intention was to exclude only indirect loss of profit, given it was well-known that loss of profit could be both direct or indirect.
In response to an argument that the agreement was reduced to a mere statement of intent (see Suisse Atlantique Societe d’Armement Maritime SA v NV Rotterdamsche Kolen Centrale [1967] AC 361, per Lord Wilberforce at p.432), at §49-§62, Carr J (while deprecating the reference to a statement of intent rule, as such) found that it had no application where the wording was clear, and where various substantive rights and remedies existed other than a claim for loss of profits, including the right to payment under the contract and the availability of equitable remedies such as specific performance, injunction and declaration. Carr J also considered, at §75, that she did not gain any real assistance from Ease Faith, given the material difference in wording.  At §81, she noted that the exclusion clause before her “conspicuously” did not contain the word “other” before “indirect or consequential losses”.
While the nature of the claim in Fujitsu (loss of payments which would have been due, but for the breach of contract) is similar to that here, little assistance is to be gained from the decision, for the same reasons Carr J found little assistance in other authorities which were merely examples of judges adopting a different interpretation on different wording.
The contractual language
The first linguistic point that EE makes is that it would not be an ordinary or natural use of language to describe EE’s claim as one for lost profits or anticipated profits. Mr Patton submitted that the reasonable reader of the TSA would not describe it in that way. He referred to the comments of Coulson LJ in Soteria Insurance v IBM United Kingdom [2022] 2 All ER (Comm) 108, at §65-70, where he observed that claims for lost profits often depend on hypotheticals, involve an element of speculation, are difficult for the contract-breaker to estimate in advance and can be notoriously open-ended. Mr Patton contrasted the position in this case, where the TSA legislates in detail as to how charges are calculated, and where the usage that diverted customers would have made of the EE network is discernible from their actual usage on a rival network during the relevant period.
That, however, is to focus too narrowly on the particular breach in issue in this case. In the case of other breaches, as Mr Patton accepted, for example the failure by EE to provide the service at all, or in the case of VM’s repudiatory breach of the contract, the calculation of the sum due either way as compensation for the loss of bargain would be subject to similar difficulties to those referred to in Soteria.
EE places particular reliance on the use of the word “anticipated” in clause 34.5(a). In the context of the breach of the exclusivity clause, there is something to be said for the proposition that – even if the loss of revenue is to be regarded as lost profit – the claim is for the profits that have already been lost as a result of the diversion of customers to other networks, as opposed to a loss of profits that are still anticipated to be made in the future.
I do not, however, accept this argument. The meaning of a claim in respect of anticipated profits cannot vary depending on the time when the claim is brought. A claim for damages following a repudiatory breach by either party would be in respect of profits that would have been made (i.e. anticipated) during the remainder of the term of the contract. Even in respect of the breach of the exclusivity obligation, the claim is for profits which it was anticipated, at the time of breach, would have been made in the future during the period the customers were diverted.
In my view the phrase “liability … in respect of anticipated profits” merely refers to liability in respect of profits that it was anticipated would be, or would have been, made, but which will not be, or were not, made because of the breach of contract. In other words, it has the same meaning as the phrase “claims for lost profits”.
I am reinforced in that view, as was the judge, by the fact that clause 34.5 carves out claims which “may include claims of damages for loss of profits”. Those words imply that what is being excepted from the exclusion would otherwise be within it, and thus suggests that the phrase “claims of damages for lost profits” is used interchangeably with the phrase “liability in respect of anticipated profits”. For that reason, I reject the submission that the use of the different phrase “damages for loss of profits” in the carve-out from clause 34.5 demonstrates that the parties deliberately confined the substantive exclusion to liability for “anticipated” profits.
Mr Patton submitted that the language of anticipated profits “simply makes it all the clearer that a claim for charges foregone by reason of VM’s breach falls outside the scope of the exclusion”.
This is a stark example of a broader failure to distinguish between the way in which a claim can be described and the legal basis underpinning that claim.
Thus, while it might be possible to describe the claim as one for “charges foregone”, that is an inaccurate formulation of the legal basis of the claim. It is common ground that EE has no claim for “Charges” (which would sound in debt), but only a claim for damages because of VM’s alleged breach of the exclusivity obligation. Those damages are calculated (on the expectation loss basis) by reference to the excess of the charges to which it would have been entitled, over the cost of providing the additional services, but for the breach. Describing it as a claim for charges foregone distances it from the appearance of a claim for lost profits, in a way that describing its essential legal basis does not.
As I have noted, there is a dispute as to whether EE would have incurred any additional expenses on the facts as they occurred here, but (1) if it did not, that just means that in the circumstances of this case the additional income would have been pure profit, and (2) in other circumstances, viewed at the time of contracting, it would have been reasonable to expect that additional expenses would have been foregone if the service did not need to be provided.
In fact, the carve-out from clause 34.5 has, in my judgment, wider significance. It carves out any damages claimed by VM pursuant to clause 34.2(c) to which clause 34.3 applies. EE acknowledges in clause 34.5 that such carved-out claims may include damages for loss of profits.
I have set out these clauses above. Clause 34.2(c) relates to any liability for damage or loss resulting from reckless or wilful misconduct or gross negligence, and clause 34.3 provides that wilful misconduct on the part of EE will include any intentional act by EE resulting in any discontinuance, withdrawal or refusal to supply any service to VM. The additional requirements to which that is subject include that VM must apply promptly for interim or other urgent equitable relief, and that any action claiming damages must continue to claim equitable relief and the reinstatement of the service as it primary remedy. It continues:
“with damages claimed only to the extent that equitable relief is not granted or only in respect of losses suffered by VM in the period from the initial discontinuance, withdrawal or refusal to supply the Service in question until re-instatement of the affected service pursuant to the equitable relief actually obtained.”
In circumstances where VM claims damages for the failure by EE to provide the service, it is difficult to see what losses – limited to those suffered in the period between discontinuance and reinstatement – could have been incurred other than lost revenue from its own customers because of their inability to access the EE network during that period. That loss is measured as the difference between the revenue it would have received from its own customers, and the amount it would have had to pay in charges to EE had the service not been discontinued or withdrawn. That is the amount required to put it in the position it would have been in if the contract had been performed, i.e. its expectation loss.
Mr Patton suggested that VM may also have a claim for loss of longer term profits, if customers chose to leave VM for good as a result of the temporary discontinuance of EE’s services. Any longer term loss of profits would appear to me, however, to fall outside the parameters of “losses suffered by VM in the period … until re-instatement of the affected service”.
In any event, that still leaves the fact that the paradigm claim that is permitted by the carve-out from the exclusion of claims in respect of anticipated profits in clause 34.5 is a claim for loss which, though calculated by reference to the profit VM would have made from its own customers using the services (i.e. the income it would have received from them less the charges due to EE), is properly characterised as VM’s expectation loss arising from the wilful discontinuance of EE’s service.
The inference, in my judgment, is that such a claim would otherwise be caught by the exclusion.
Mr Patton also criticised the judge for relying on the fact that if “anticipated profits” are limited to losses apart from expectation loss, then clause 34.4 (which excluded indirect losses) would be rendered otiose. He contended that clause 34.4 only barred claims for losses within the second limb of Hadley v Baxendale, whereas claims for loss of profits might fall within either the first or second limb of Hadley v Baxendale.
It is true that, as Mr Patton also submitted, the court should guard against giving the presumption against surplusage too much prominence because, as Coulson LJ commented in Mutual Energy v Starr Underwriting Agents [2016] EWHC 590 (TCC) at §35, “as we all know, some tautology, some overlapping terms, some surplusage, will often be found in commercial contracts.”  There is, however, force in the view that clauses 34.4 and 34.5 are aimed at different things, and are intended to operate cumulatively. As in Fujitsu (and unlike the two salvage cases) the reference to profits is not immediately followed by wording such as “or other” indirect or consequential loss.
I accept that the exclusion of claims in respect of anticipated profits – even if meant to add to the exclusion of indirect or consequential losses – could be intended to capture just those loss of profits claims which, while still characterised as direct loss, fall outside the concept of expectation loss. The limited category of lost profits claims that would remain is emphasised by the fact that the first example Mr Patton gives of such a claim is actually expectation loss: namely the loss VM suffers by losing out on charges under its contracts with customers consequent upon EE causing a network outage (as I have sought to explain above, in the context of the claim preserved by the carve-out in clause 34.3).
More importantly, I consider that, if the parties had in mind such detailed distinctions between the types of loss of profit claims, the exclusion clause would have been drafted with greater specificity. Accordingly, I consider that the two clauses taken together point more persuasively to the conclusion that the broad and unqualified reference to “liability in respect of anticipated profits” applies to claims based on loss of profits, whether those fall under the heading of expectation loss, or whether they fall under the first or second limb of the rule in Hadley v Baxendale.
Mr Patton relied also on the fact that, pursuant to the amendment agreed in 2016, VM was entitled to terminate the TSA without notice in certain circumstances (which essentially involved it being taken over by, or it taking over, another UK MNO), but was then required to pay EE a substantial amount (ranging from £315 million to £193 million, depending on the date of termination). Against that background, he submitted that it was unlikely that the parties intended VM to be able to breach its exclusivity obligations and invoke clause 34.5 to insulate itself from the duty to pay compensation.
There are two points in answer to this. First, there was no such provision in the TSA as drafted, and it has not been suggested that the meaning of clause 34.5 changed upon the introduction of the amendment. The contents of the amendment agreement are therefore of limited if any relevance to the construction of clause 34.5. Second, while the contract was on foot, irrespective of how many customers VM migrated away from EE’s network, VM remained obliged to pay the Minimum Revenue Commitment, which by 2019 was £132 million per year. The suggested incentive to VM to insulate itself from any duty to pay compensation is therefore illusory.
The commercial consequences
EE’s over-arching point under this heading is that if the judge’s construction of the exclusion clause is correct, then EE is left without any effective remedy for VM’s alleged breach of the exclusivity obligation. That is because, in the circumstances which have in fact happened, first, EE suffered no wasted expenditure and so would have no damages claim at all and, second, there was serious doubt as to whether it could have obtained an injunction, even if it could overcome the difficulty that it had insufficient information to apply for one in the first place. In this latter respect, therefore, the judge’s conclusion was based on the flawed reasoning that EE would likely have had a “strong claim” for injunctive relief.
Mr Patton submitted that, as the judge rightly recognised, an exemption clause will not normally be interpreted as extending to a situation which would defeat the main object of the contract or create a commercial absurdity, citing Coulson LJ in Soteria (above) at §60: “the more extreme the consequences, the more stringent the court must be before construing the clause in a way which allows the contract-breaker to avoid liability for what may be his catastrophic non-performance”.
EE also relies on the decision of the Court of Appeal in Kudos Catering (above). The rejection in that case of the broader interpretation of a claim for loss of profits was motivated by the fact that it left the agreement “effectively devoid of contractual content since there is no sanction for non-performance by the respondent. It is inherently unlikely that the parties intended the clause to have this effect.” The contention that the claimant contractor could have obtained an order for specific performance or a negative injunction to restrain the defendant from excluding it from the venue was rejected. Tomlinson LJ, at §16, considered it “very optimistic” to think that the claimant could have obtained such relief. Having regard to the specific provisions of the contract, which involved many continuing and interrelated obligations on both sides, he characterised (at §18) the suggestion that the claimant could have performed the contract without the full-hearted cooperation of the defendant as “wholly unstainable”.
It is here, again, important to have regard to the fact that the commercial reasonableness of the judge’s interpretation must be judged at the time of entry into the TSA and by reference to the range of likely circumstances in which clause 34.5 might apply. EE’s argument focuses too narrowly on the breach which it is alleged has in fact occurred.
Taking a wider view, there are likely to be many other circumstances in which the innocent party would have a claim for wasted expenditure in the event of breach by the other, for example in cases of repudiatory breach.
Even if, therefore, EE does not have a damages claim that escapes the exclusion clause in the circumstances of this case, while that is a relevant consideration, it loses much of its force when set against the range of possible claims that would have been in the contemplation of the parties at the time the agreement was made.
The same is true as regards the availability of injunctive relief. The particular difficulties EE might have had in connection with a claim for an injunction in the circumstances of this case do not undermine the utility of injunctive relief in the case of other breaches that would have been in the contemplation of the parties when the agreement was made, for example in the case of the failure by EE to provide the services, or of VM to accept them. In the case of wilful breach by EE, the contract goes further, mandating that injunctive relief is the primary remedy VM must seek (see clause 34.3(c), discussed above). More generally, the fact that the parties agreed that neither would argue that damages was an adequate remedy points towards their contemplation that injunctive relief was a real and valuable remedy.
The continuing obligations of the parties to each other under the TSA are very different in nature from those in the contract in issue in Kudos Catering, and the problems which led Tomlinson LJ to conclude that there was no realistic possibility of an order for specific performance are not replicated here. I observe that even in the extreme commercial consequences of Kudos Catering, the solution adopted by the Court of Appeal was to read down the ambit of the exclusion clause, not by concluding that the loss claimed fell outside the scope of “loss of profits” on the true meaning of the exclusion clause, but by limiting the type of breach to which the clause applied (i.e. limiting its application to cases of defective performance).
It is also of note, as Mr Zellick pointed out, that the particular difficulties EE would have had in the circumstances of a breach of the exclusivity obligation as amended could not have been in the contemplation of the parties at the time the agreement was made. The difficulty for EE, in knowing whether any breach was occurring, was exacerbated by the amendments made in 2016 because after that point the mere fact that a customer of VM is placed with another MNO is not itself indicative of a breach of the exclusivity obligation; it is also necessary to show that the customer is one to whom 5G services are offered.
Looking more broadly at clause 34.5(a) in the context of the TSA as a whole, and against the range of possible claims which may give rise to a claim for loss of anticipated profits, I do not think that the judge’s construction is to be rejected on the basis that it is uncommercial. As she noted, and as Mr Zellick submitted to us, it is part of a carefully drafted agreement which allocates risk between the parties. On the judge’s construction, exclusion of claims for loss of expectation leaves the parties with valuable contractual rights, readily enforceable in a range of circumstances by specific performance or injunction, or by awards of damages based on wasted expenditure.
From EE’s perspective, an important part of the overall allocation of risk is the Minimum Revenue Commitment, which entitles it to payment from VM ranging from £120 million to £132 million per year. I accept that this does not meet the concern as to the lack of remedy in relation to a breach of the exclusivity obligation, because that obligation has any commercial relevance only where the Minimum Revenue Commitment is already exceeded. It is relevant, however, in considering the overall commercial sense of the allocation of risk in the TSA as a whole, for example in considering the commerciality of the exclusion of liability in respect of anticipated profits in the context of other breaches by VM.
Conclusion
Taking into account the points made above in relation to the language of the TSA and the commercial consequences, and notwithstanding the cogent and attractive arguments presented by Mr Patton, I consider that the judge came to the right answer on the interpretation of clause 34.5(a).
To summarise: (1) there is no overarching principle of law that limits an exclusion of liability for loss of anticipated profits to losses other than expectation loss or diminution in price; (2) in some cases similar wording has been found to be so limited, but in other cases it has not; (3) the wording of the exclusion in this case is clear and unequivocal; (4) the better view is that clauses 34.4 and 34.5 are intended to be read cumulatively, so that liability for anticipated profits is intended to indicate something additional to loss which does not arise directly from the performance of the TSA, and if the parties had intended clause 34.5(a) to cover only direct loss of profit claims that do not fall within the ambit of expectation loss, they would have done so specifically; (5) the better view is that “anticipated profits” is used within clause 34.5 interchangeably with “loss of profits”; (6) the fact that at least the paradigm case that falls within clause 34.3(c), and is thus carved out from the exclusion in 34.5(a), is a claim for expectation loss points towards such a claim otherwise being covered by clause 34.5(a); (7) the clause is part of a lengthy contract drafted with the assistance of legal advice on both sides, involving a careful allocation of risk for both parties; and (8) the consequences of this reading of clause 34.5(a), in the context of the range of its possible applications at the time of entry into the TSA, are commercially reasonable, and no less so than the alternative reading, particularly in view of the substantive remedies that remain across those applications (whether by way of damages or equitable relief).
Accordingly, I conclude that EE’s claim is excluded by clause 34.5(a), and I would dismiss this appeal.
Lord Justice Phillips
The commercial bargain embodied in the TSA was that VM would use EE’s telecommunications services and would pay Charges (as defined) for so doing. There was, however, no positive obligation on VM to use EE’s services. Instead, the key contractual obligation of VM, giving effect to that bargain, was the exclusivity provision in clause 10, supported by the Minimum Revenue Commitment in clause 17. The centrality of the exclusivity provision is perhaps demonstrated by the fact that the exclusion of 5G services from its scope resulted in VM utilising the 5G services of other MNOs and migrating linked 2G-4G services from EE to those MNOs, resulting in the present dispute as to when the latter was permitted by the clause.
In my judgment it would be surprising if the parties intended that VM could breach the key exclusivity provision, unlawfully diverting its customers to a third party supplier, without incurring liability to pay EE damages reflecting the loss of revenue resulting from that breach. A right to claim for the amount of lost charges (less costs savings, in the unlikely event that there were any) by reason of such diversion would be conventional, straightforward and would simply reflect the commercial bargain made. To exclude that right would undermine the bargain and it is unclear why the parties would have so provided consistently with business common sense. I do not consider that the theoretical availability of injunctive relief to prevent VM’s alleged breach is a real answer to that conundrum, not least given the likely delay in EE discovering that VM was engaged in significant diversion. Further, where the parties envisaged that the primary remedy for breach would be to obtain an injunction, they expressly so provided: see clause 34.3(c) of the TSA in relation to the far more immediate and discernible wrongful discontinuation of its service by EE. Neither is the theoretical availability of a claim for wasted expenditure a sensible substitute for a straightforward claim for lost revenue, particularly as the parties would have known when entering the TSA that the addition of customers to EE’s network required no additional expenditure by EE.
Zacaroli LJ emphasises more than once in his judgment that it is important not to focus too narrowly on the particular breach in issue when considering the meaning of the exclusion of liability. While I agree with that as a general proposition, its application depends on the nature of the particular breach. Where, as in this case, it is a breach of the central obligation of one of the parties, it is right to focus intently on whether the parties really intended that the enforceability of that obligation would be significantly undermined by the exclusion clause in question.
In my judgment, adopting the words used by Tomlinson LJ in Kudos Catering at [20], it would require language “fairly susceptible of one meaning only” to exclude EE’s right to claim damages for breach of the key exclusivity provision. In this regard two well-known principles of contractual interpretation coincide. First, as Lord Clarke of Ston-cum-Ebony pointed out in Rainy Sky at [21]:
“If there are two possible contractions, the court is entitled to prefer the construction which is consistent with business common sense and to reject the other.”
Second, as Tomlinson LJ summarised at [21] of Kudos Catering:
“There also comes into play the  presumption that neither party to a contract intends to abandon any remedies for its breach arising by operation of law – see per Lord Diplock in Gilbert-Ash (Northern) Ltd v Modern Engineering (Bristol) Ltd [1974] AC 689 at page 717.  Lord Diplock went on to say that clear words must be used to rebut this presumption and the judge plainly thought that the words here used were sufficiently clear for that purpose.”
In my judgment, however, it is far from clear that the exclusion of damages claims for “anticipated profits” encompasses a claim for loss of revenue by reason of a breach of the exclusivity provision. It is correct that EE’s damages claim is, strictly speaking, for profit it would have made from VM’s lost custom (albeit that would simply be the revenue), but in my judgment the loss is properly to be regarded as a readily ascertainable sum that would have been payable to EE by way of the contractual price for the use of its services had VM not diverted its business elsewhere. In my view, in contrast, the term “anticipated profits” indicates hoped for but uncertain profits which would arise as a consequence of, but outside, performance of the contract, not sums directly payable under the contract. That reading is reinforced by the commercial rationale referred to above that the parties would not have excluded a remedy for the key obligation of VM under the TSA, applying the approach taken in Kudos Catering and University of Wales v London College of Business.
I do not consider that the carve-out from clause 34.5 requires that that clause be read as excluding EE’s claim for breach of the exclusivity provision. The carve-out permits VM to claim loss of profits, but these will be profits it would have made from its own customers (the paradigm case being a wrongful withdrawal of service by EE) and so will be a loss of profits from dealings with third parties outside the contract, not the loss of sums which would have been payable by EE under the contract had it been performed.
I also do not consider that reading clause 34.5 as excluding only indirect or consequential losses of profit outside the contract gives rise to a problem of redundancy in relation to clause 34.4, which expressly excludes indirect, consequential or incidental loss. In my judgment the sequential exclusion of such losses, and then loss of profits, reflects a standard and well-recognised formulation, such as the clause in The Herdentor and Ease Faith.  In the TSA the exclusion of indirect or consequential losses and loss of profits has been split into two clauses, but that appears to be in order to permit the carve-out in relation to loss of profits. I do not see it as effecting a reversal of the conventional approach to excluding loss of profits, giving rise as it would to the commercially surprising result described above.
For the above reasons I would allow the appeal.
Lord Justice Coulson
I have not found the central issue in this case easy to decide. Like Phillips LJ, my original instinct was that the claim for sums that would otherwise have been due under the TSA was not caught by the exclusion clause, because that would strike at the heart of the bargain between the parties. However, I have concluded that the analysis of Zacaroli LJ is to be preferred. Since my Lords disagree, I should set out briefly why I have come to the conclusion that the appeal should be dismissed.
The issue is whether the provision that “neither Party shall have liability to the other in respect of…anticipated profits” excludes this claim. In my view, Zacaroli LJ is right to say that there can be no magic in the words “anticipated profits” since the expression “loss of profits” is used interchangeably in clause 34.5.
For EE’s claim to fall outside the exclusion clause, EE have to say, as a matter of construction, that “anticipated profits” refers to profits anticipated to be earned outside the TSA. That was Mr Patton’s argument before us, summarised by Zacaroli LJ at [46] above.
But why should those words be given that very specific and qualified meaning? There is nothing whatsoever in the words themselves to indicate that they are referring only to anticipated profits to be earned outside the TSA, not profits under the TSA. On the face of it, such a construction requires the insertion of words that are just not there.
Furthermore, the provisions as a whole point the other way. In my view, clause 34.4 already excludes any claims for profits lost outside the TSA, because that clause is expressly designed to exclude indirect or consequential losses. That would plainly cover profits anticipated to be earned outside the TSA. If that is right, then to import the same qualification into clause 34.5 not only does unnecessary violence to the words of clause 34.5, but would also have the effect of duplicating an exclusion that already existed.
I am not persuaded by Phillips LJ’s suggestion, at [110] above, that this was a standard formulation which had been amended simply to permit the carve-out in favour of VM. But even if it was, that works against EE, because it means that VM saw that their claims under clause 34.3 – which might include claims for loss of profit under the TSA, not outside the TSA - would be excluded by clause 34.5, and so obtained the required carve-out. EE did not, so there is no similar carve-out in their favour of the kind that they now contend for.
In my view, a consideration of the applicable law and the commercial consequences of this construction do not alter this conclusion: in fact, they confirm it.
As to the law, it is not unfair to describe the cases relied on by EE and analysed by Zacaroli LJ in his judgment at [33] – [39] and [54] – [62] as something of a ragbag of particular results in particular types of cases (the salvage cases of Herdentor and Ease Faith, and the sale of goods cases, such as Glencore and Galtrade). The judgments in those cases cannot be woven together to comprise any sort of principle. On the other hand, the decision that, at least in some ways, is closest to this case, both in its words and its context, is Fujitsu. There, Carr J (as she then was) roundly rejected arguments that were very similar to those put forward by Mr Patton in this case. In the end, of course, these decisions almost always come down to the words used and the commercial background against which the words must be construed, so other cases are always of limited utility.
As to the commercial consequences of the judge’s construction, I was originally struck by the fact that the claim here, albeit a claim for damages, was in essence a claim for the Charges that would have been otherwise recoverable under the TSA. It therefore seemed to me to be potentially artificial to label that as a claim for lost profit.
However, I think that, on analysis, that is precisely what it is. As a result of VM’s alleged breaches of the exclusivity agreement, EE would in principle have had two different types of claim. First, they would have had a claim for any expenditure that they had wasted because they had anticipated X number of customers, and had spent money on providing the necessary infrastructure for X number of customers, only to find that – due to VM’s breaches – some of that money had been wasted because they only had X less Y customers. The claim for wasted expenditure would not be caught by the loss of profits exclusion clause (see Soteria) and would be recoverable against VM.
Secondly they would have a claim for loss of profits.  It would only be that second claim which would be irrecoverable as a result of clause 34.5.
That there could have been a claim for wasted expenditure in the present case seems to me to be confirmed by EE’s own evidence, and in particular paragraphs 27 and 28 of the witness statement of Mr Harrap dated 17 March 2023. He refers to the “billions of pounds that EE had incurred in building and maintaining the network.” He refers to the “very significant operational costs in providing network services to users”. He concludes: “I believe that EE would have incurred costs and overheads which were specific driven by the additional capacity (such as backhaul capacity) built into the network to cater for VM customers (and the demand that VM forecast they would use”).
In the light of that specific evidence, I do not agree with Phillips LJ’s view at [105] that a wasted expenditure claim in these circumstances was a theoretical claim. It seems to me that such a claim could have been separately identified if EE had wished: the “specific” costs and overheads “driven by the additional capacity” as described by Mr Harrap. The problem is that EE has chosen to claim the charges that they would otherwise have recovered under the TSA, without reduction or qualification, and without any attempt to differentiate between wasted expenditure and loss of profit. Moreover the charges claimed could never have been recoverable as damages for breach: even if a very large element of the charges could have been shown to be pure profit, EE would always have had to have given credit for the costs that they would have incurred in providing the service to the customers who were migrated away.
I suspect that I have reached my conclusion with a little more reluctance than Zacaroli LJ. But in the end, for the reasons I have briefly stated, I have concluded that both his analysis – and more importantly, the judge’s careful judgment - are correct, and that this appeal should be dismissed.

.............................
Lady Justice Nicola Davies:
The issue in this appeal is whether Ritchie J (“the judge”) misconstrued the provisions of the Dentists Act 1984 (“the 1984 Act”) in setting aside the direction of the appellant’s Professional Conduct Committee (“PCC”) made on 21 July 2023.  Following a fitness to practise hearing, the PCC determined that the facts admitted or found proved in respect of the respondent amounted to misconduct and made a further finding that his fitness to practise was impaired.  Pursuant to section 27B(6)(b) of the 1984 Act, the PCC directed that the respondent’s registration be suspended for a period of 9 months (“the substantive suspension”) and further ordered that pursuant to section 30 of the 1984 Act, the respondent’s registration be suspended forthwith (“the immediate suspension”).
Following the hearing of the respondent’s appeal, in an order dated 28 December 2023, the judge quashed the direction for a 9 months’ suspension under section 27B(6)(b) and substituted for it a direction that the respondent be suspended for a total period of 9 months, from which the duration of the suspension already served under the immediate suspension order shall be deducted.  The judge treated the period of substantive suspension and the period of immediate suspension as one continuous period of suspension, which he stated should be subject to an aggregate upper limit of 12 months.
I am satisfied that the judge did misconstrue the relevant sections of the 1984 Act in treating a substantive period of suspension and the immediate period of suspension as if they were one continuous period of suspension.
Relevant background
The factual background is of limited relevance to the merits of the General Dental Council’s (“GDC”) appeal.  In summary, the respondent was found to have harassed a dental nurse; he failed to inform the GDC until January 2021 of his arrest and charge by the police with an offence under the Protection from Harassment Act 1997.  Before the PCC, the respondent admitted the underlying conduct but denied: (i) that he knew that his conduct was harassing (Head of Charge 1) and (ii) that he acted dishonestly in failing to inform the GDC of a criminal charge (Head of Charge 4).  Having considered the evidence, which included oral evidence from the respondent and submissions from counsel, the PCC determined that all of the Heads of Charge save for the dishonesty charge were proved and that this amounted to misconduct on three grounds: (i) the course of harassing conduct; (ii) the failure by the respondent to inform the GDC promptly of the criminal charge and (iii) the restraining order imposed by the magistrates court in May 2021 following agreement between the prosecution and defence that no evidence would be offered against the respondent in exchange for him agreeing to be made subject to a five year restraining order.
Following its determination that the respondent’s fitness to practise was impaired by reason of misconduct, the PCC then addressed the issue of substantive sanction and concluded that the respondent’s misconduct was too serious for the imposition of conditions to be sufficient or appropriate.  It determined that a period of suspension would be sufficient to protect patients and the public and to maintain public confidence in the profession.  The PCC concluded that a 9 months’ suspension, with a review, was sufficient to mark the seriousness of the respondent’s misconduct and to permit him to complete the necessary remediation.  It made the section 27B(6)(b) direction.  The PCC then invited submissions on the issue of whether or not to impose an immediate order of suspension under section 30 of the 1984 Act, following which it ordered that it was necessary for the protection of the public and otherwise in the public interest to suspend the respondent’s registration immediately.
The respondent exercised his right of appeal under section 29(1)(b) of the 1984 Act.  He did not challenge the proportionality of a sanction of suspension but contended that the 9 months’ period of suspension was too long as there was no real risk of repetition or of similar behaviour and further, that the PCC had attached insufficient weight to the facts.  The respondent’s grounds of appeal were rejected by the judge.  During the hearing, the judge raised the issue of whether the substantive sanction of suspension should run from the date on which the respondent’s appeal was determined.  The parties were invited by the judge to make written submissions upon the issue and did so.  Following consideration of those submissions the judge made the determination which is the subject of this appeal and included the same in his judgment of the entirety of the appeal.
In accordance with the judge’s order, the respondent subsequently appeared at a hearing before the PCC on 17 April 2024, the purpose being to review his suspension.  Upon review, the PCC determined that the respondent’s fitness to practise remained impaired as he had yet to address and remediate the concerns which had led to his initial suspension.  The PCC directed that the respondent’s suspension should be extended by a further 4 months in order for him to have sufficient time to address its concerns.  At a further review hearing on 26 July 2024, the PCC concluded that, in the light of the evidence of the respondent’s insight and remediation, his fitness to practise was no longer impaired and revoked the respondent’s suspension.
I granted permission to appeal on 18 April 2024.

The judgment of Ritchie J
The judge concluded: (i) that the PCC’s approach on sanction was correct.  They understood that punishment was not the objective, the protection of the public and of the profession was relevant as was giving the respondent time to reform himself; (ii) on the evidence, the findings of fact by the PCC and the length of the substantive suspension direction were reasonable.  [83] – [85].
At [30] the judge identified what he considered to be a ‘problem’, namely that as a consequence of the imposition of the section 30 immediate suspension order, should a dentist appeal and should the appeal take 4.5 months to be heard  (as this one did) the GDC interprets the 9 months’ suspension direction, which “takes effect” when the appeal is dismissed, as 9 months without any deduction for the suspension already served.  Thus, on the GDC’s interpretation of the 1984 Act, the total suspension will be increased from 9 months to 13.5 months which is more than the 12 months maximum permitted by section 27B(6)(b) of the 1984 Act.   The judge identified the issue as being “whether the GDC’s interpretation of the interaction between [sections] 27B, 29A and 30 is correct.”
At [36] the judge noted that the imposition of the maximum of 12 months suspension in section 27B(6)(b) is not qualified or subject to any exceptions in the 1984 Act.  He described it as “an absolute maximum and it applies to suspension.”  At [37] the judge observed that section 29A determines when the section 27B suspension direction “usually” takes effect.  The timing of the taking effect provision differs in each of the subsections of section 29A.  He noted that what the section does is “set the default date for direction to suspend to take effect.  What the section does not do is expressly state how it interacts with  S.30 in relation to the duration of this suspension nor does it set any start date, …. .”
In interpreting the section 30 provision for immediate suspension the judge identified the ‘plain grammatical meaning’ of the words as follows: [38] and [39]
“…subsection (1) makes it plain that the power granted to the PCC under S.30 only arises “on giving a direction for …. suspension”. Thus the S.30 powers is parasitic on the S.27B direction for suspension….  Once the suspension direction is made, the threshold for making a different “taking effect” date from the default one is partly opened.  Then, to grant the S.30 order, the PCC must be “satisfied that to do so is necessary”.  A further assessment of the evidence is required for this necessity test….
The plain words [of section 30] then go on to state that the PCC “may order that his registration is suspended forthwith”. But it adds the caveat “in accordance with this section”. Subsection (3) sets out that the immediate suspension order takes effect “from the time when the order is made.” Thus, the words express that the start of the PCC’s suspension decision will be “forthwith” if the immediate order is made. Nothing is said about thesuspension being of a different kind of suspension or being a different beast under S.30, as distinct from the suspension made in the direction under S.27B. The use of the word “order” instead of “direction” needs some thought.”
At [41] the judge noted that nothing is said in section 30 about empowering the PCC to make the immediate suspension order as a cumulative suspension or a different suspension in addition to the direction for suspension.  He continued [41] – [43]:
Nor would this be the ordinary understanding of the Section,in my judgment, because the S.30 power is wholly parasitic on the S.27B decision to apply suspension as the sanction. The S.30 power is not free standing. No express words were inserted to state that the time served under the immediate suspension was to be added to the carefully measured and titrated final sanction passed by the PCC under S.27B, after considering the aggravating factors, the mitigating factors, the remediation and the insight of the registrant. S.30 is circumspect in referring only to the ending of the immediate suspension. It does not purport to alter the length of the main suspension by its express words.
Once the immediate suspension order has expired, because the appeal has been dismissed (struck out or withdrawn) what happens? For this we return to S.29A, the default “taking effect” provision. It sets out at subparagraph (2) that the original direction “shall take effect” ... (b) on withdrawal or striking out ... or (c) ...on the dismissal of the appeal”. So, once the appeal is dismissed the PCC’s original direction for suspension “takes effect”. The word used is not “starts”. Nor does any section say that the suspension starts then. This is at the root of the grammatical analysis of the interaction between the Sections. It has led to confusion because “takes effect” has been interpreted as “start” for the purposes of determining the duration of the directed suspension after the end of an appeal.
From this analysis I conclude that the Sections do not deal expressly with the issue of whether the period of suspension served under an immediate order is to be deducted from the period of suspension served under a direction or whether one follows the other in full. Thus, I shall look at the legal and factual context and the purpose of the Sections and the consequences of the various proposed interpretations for assistance.”
The judge reviewed authorities which considered the approach of professional health care tribunals to the imposition of consecutive suspension periods and observed at [56] that it had been the subject of “considerable judicial adverse comment, but had not been subject of full argument.”
At [92] the judge observed that if the GDC’s interpretation of section 30 is correct, the respondent will have served a period of 13.5 months’ suspension.  He stated:
… In my judgment, such an interpretation breaches the statutory ban on any suspension being over 12 months and is in effect a punishment for appealing which is contrary to established principle. The effects of the interaction of the Sections does not permit for a longer duration of suspension. Parliament fixed the maximum duration in S.27B(6)(b) of 12 months and did not legislate for that to be ignored or breached by the interaction between Sections 29A and 30. The latter are subservient to the former. I consider that the GDC’s interpretation of the Sections drives a coach and horses through the statutory 12 month maximum on the PCC’s power to impose suspensions which cannot have been the intention of Parliament.”
At [93] the judge stated that the GDC’s interpretation was unfair to the appellant which effectively increased the PCC’s carefully measured and titrated sanction just because he has appealed.
Drawing the strands together the judge concluded:
Taking into account the wording of the Sections, the purpose of the Act, the context and the objectives of the Act, the consequences of the various possible constructions and the case law, in my judgment there is a difference between the words “takes effect” and “start”. In the Sections the legislators used the words “takes effect” so as to distinguish between the ending of the effect of the immediate order for suspension and the commencement of the effect of the direction for suspension. However, there was only one suspension and it only started once.
That suspension could have started either when it took effect: (1) by default under S.29A after 28 days or at the end of an unsuccessful appeal, or (2) when, under S.30 an order for immediate suspension was made. In this case (2) applied and the suspension started immediately.
In my judgment, after a final hearing, when a direction for suspension is made and an immediate order for suspension is made, there is only one suspension made under the Act. The Sections do not expressly state that a suspension starts only when the direction for suspension “takes effect”, so I do not consider that the express words determine when the suspension starts. In my judgment, applying a normal and sensible interpretation of the words “takes effect” in S.29A, in accordance with the 12 month maximum in S.27B(6)(b), and to match the true context in which a S.30 order is made, which is parasitic, the Appellant’s suspension started when the immediate suspension order took effect.
For all of these reasons I consider that the correct construction of the Sections in the context of this appeal is that: (1) the start of the suspension was when it actually started, namely when the immediate suspension order took effect. (2) When the immediate suspension order ceases to have any effect (when the order on this appeal is made) then the direction for suspension will “take effect”. The change over from the order having the effect to suspend to the direction having the effect to suspend makes no difference to the suspension, it remains exactly the same. In my judgment the end of the suspensionoccurs after 9 months of suspension have been served and it does not matter which piece of paper had the effect of causing the suspension.”
In any event, I consider that the only correct and lawful way for the PCC to pass a direction for suspension, when they may be going on to consider an immediate suspension order, is to ensure that it is worded so as to credit any time served under any immediate order for suspension against the duration of the direction for suspension.
Thus, in my judgment, the proper interpretation of S.29A, after an appeal like this, when it is determined that the sanction was not wrong and when a direction order then “takes effect”, does not result in the suspension starting again. It means that the suspension already in place under the immediate order continues under the directions order and expires at the time which has been determined by the PCC, in this case 9 months from when it started.”
The judgment of Morris J in Professional Standards Authority for Health and Social Care v General Dental Council and Arthif Danial [2024] EWHC 2610 (Admin) (‘Danial’)
Since Ritchie J delivered judgment in this case, Morris J considered two distinct appeals from the GDC in which the PCC had determined that the registrant’s fitness to practise was impaired and directed a 5 months’ suspension with review and also ordered immediate suspension.  One of the appeals was by the registrant and included an appeal against the imposition of the sanction.  The appeal in respect of sanction required Morris J to determine whether the 5 months’ suspension direction would take effect from the conclusion of the appeal or whether the period during which the registrant had been suspended pursuant to the immediate suspension order should be deducted from the 5 months of the suspension direction.  The effect of this would be that the registrant would no longer be suspended and could return to practice.
At [205] Morris J noted that until the decision in Aga, the authorities had supported the former position namely that the suspension direction takes effect from the determination of the appeal and there is no deduction for time spent suspended under an immediate suspension order.  One issue which Morris J was required to determine was whether he agreed with the analysis of Ritchie J and, if he did not, whether there was a powerful reason for him to depart from Ritchie J’s decision in Aga.
The analysis and determination of Morris J is set out at [253] – [271].  He identified the issue as being a question of statutory construction, primarily of section 29A and section 30 of the 1984 Act.  Morris J concluded that Ritchie J’s decision in Aga is wrong.  He noted that the issue was raised late in the case and Ritchie J did not have the benefit of oral argument whereas he had received seven sets of written submissions and had listened to a day of oral argument.  The reasoning of Morris J is as follows:
First the issue of the relationship between a suspension direction under section 29A and an immediate suspension order is a question of statutory interpretation (for this Court). It is not a question of judgment or discretion for the Court, nor a matter of “the current practice of the [GDC]” or other regulators (as suggested at §§3, 30. 56 and 102). Further whilst fairness in the operation of the disciplinary procedure is necessarily required (not least by virtue of CPR 52.21(3)). I do not agree that this forms part of the express objectives of the Act, either expressly or impliedly, as suggested §35 of the judgment.
Secondly, the central element of Ritchie J’s construction of the statutory provisions is that there is a distinction to be drawn between the suspension direction starting and it taking effect. At the heart of his analysis is, first, that there is only ever one suspension and, secondly, the words “take effect” (at least in some cases) means something different from “start”(but not in others). I do not agree. In my judgment the words “take effect” where they appear in sections 29A and 30 mean “start” or “commence”. The words used are not merely “have effect” (or “are effective” or “are in force or in operation”). Moreover, the Aga judgment does not give a consistent meaning to the words “take effect”. For example, within §97 of the judgment itself, the reference to “took effect” in (1) means “start”, yet the reference to “take effect” in (2) means “have effect/ are in force”. The Aga judgment makes numerous references to the word “start”, seeking to distinguish it from “take effect” (see §§43, 94-97); yetthat word does not appear at all in the statutory provisions.
Thirdly, Aga does not address the position in relation to erasure and the fact that the immediate suspension order provisions apply to erasure in the same way as they apply to a suspension direction. In Aga it is accepted that in the case of erasure, the dentist is not struck off until the end of, and following on after, the immediate suspension order has ended. On the other hand, it finds that a suspension direction effectively commences from the date of the immediate suspension order. It is notable that the Aga judgment omits the references to erasure in section 30(1) and (3).
Fourthly, at §39 the Aga judgment expressly notes that “the use of the word “order” instead of “direction” needs some thought”. In fact at no point thereafter does the judgment address the clear distinction made in the Act between a direction for suspension and an order for immediate suspension. That distinct terminology used in the words of the statute means that it is not the case there is only ever “one suspension” (which is central to the analysis in Aga at §§94 and 96). Whilst the concern about a registrant being suspended from practice for more than the 12 month maximum for an initial suspension direction is understandable, it is based on the premise that there is only one suspension and that the direction and the order are one and the same thing.
Fifthly, Aga does not address the different purpose of a suspension direction and an immediate suspension order. The former is intended to give the registrant the opportunity to remediate his conduct and re-establish fitness to practise; the latter is a measure for the protection of the public pending appeal.
Sixthly, as regards the previous case authorities, whilst it is the case that some of the passages supporting the GDC’s interpretation are obiter and whilst there are judicial observations as to the apparent unfairness of that interpretation, those cases all suggest that the solution to the problem lies with Parliament to legislate. Significantly the Aga judgment did not refer to the important §36 of W v Health and Care Professions Council. Secondly, whilst the case of Khan is cited elsewhere in the Aga judgment, there is no reference to the important §22, an obiter dictum of the Supreme Court.
Finally, if Aga is correct, then whenever there is an immediate suspension order, every suspension direction is in practice for a period less that the amount specified in the direction itself. This will inevitably be the case where there is an appeal, but it will also be the case where there is no appeal (because of the 28 days allowed to appeal). The effect, on the Aga basis, is that there is only ever one suspension and the suspension direction runs from the first day of the order under section 30 and either section 29A has no meaning or the suspension direction runs for 28 days less that ordered under the direction.
For these reasons I conclude that the decision on this issue in Aga is wrong and I decline to follow it.”
Ground of appeal
There is one ground namely that the judge erred in law in allowing the respondent’s appeal upon the basis that the period of suspension under the order of immediate suspension should be deducted from the length of the substantive direction of suspension (contrary to the established practice of the GDC and that of other regulators applying cognate provisions).  It was accepted by the appellant and the respondent that this ground of appeal raises a point of law of general public importance which is not confined to this case or to the GDC.
The appellant’s submissions
The primary contention of the appellant is that the judge was wrong to treat a direction for substantive suspension and a section 30 immediate order of suspension as forming one continuous suspension.  In law and in fact they are distinct: they are made under different sections of the 1984 Act; one is a direction and the other is an order; they are made at different stages of the fitness to practise process; each is made applying a different test albeit there is some overlap; they serve different purposes and are subject to different mechanisms of challenge.
The appellant submits that the 1984 Act makes no provision for an immediate order to be “set off” against the substantive sanction, a view consistently adopted in the authorities when the matter has been canvassed (R (Ghosh) v General Medical Council [2006] EWHC 2743 (Admin) at [27] per Bean J and W v Health and Care Professions Tribunal [2022] CSIH 47 at [37] – [38]).
In particular, the appellant relies upon the fact that an immediate order of suspension differs from an interim order made prior to the PCC hearing as the PCC determining the fitness to practise case and any resulting sanction will know how long the registrant has served by way of interim suspension (Adil v General Medical Council [2023] EWCA Civ 1261).
The appellant also relies upon the anomalies created by the judge’s decision which include the following: if no appeal is brought by the registrant, the substantive sanction will start on the expiry of the 28 day time limit for bringing an appeal (section 29A(2) of the 1984 Act).  If the judge is correct, the result is that even when a registrant does not appeal, where an immediate order has been made, 28 days should be deducted from a substantive suspension of 12 months. If a substantive sanction of 6 months suspension was directed with an immediate order but determination of the registrant’s appeal took longer than 6 months, the direction of suspension would never take effect notwithstanding the clear and mandatory language in section 29A(2).  It is the substantive section which serves to maintain professional standards and public confidence in the profession.  It would also mean that a review would not be able to take place before the registrant’s return to practice which would prevent the PCC from assessing whether the registrant’s fitness to practise remained impaired.  It could also prevent any review period being extended.
The appellant contends that the judge’s conclusions undermine one of the aims of professional disciplinary sanctions namely to provide an opportunity for the registrant to remediate their failings.  If the judge is correct, there may not be time for the registrant to engage in any meaningful remediation during the remaining period of the substantive sanction once the appeal has been dismissed.
The respondent’s submissions
With commendable frankness, Mr Kennedy KC informed the court that the point which is the subject of this appeal was not taken by him on behalf of the respondent before Ritchie J.  He was right not to do so.  As the outcome of this appeal will not affect the registration of the respondent because the effect of the PCC’s order of 26 July 2024 is that the name of the respondent is no longer suspended on the Register of Dentists, Mr Kennedy made his submissions upon the basis that the matters raised in this appeal are of concern to the dental and other healthcare professions.  Clarity is required, not least because of the fundamental disagreement between the interpretations of Ritchie J in this case and Morris J in Danial.
In essence, the respondent’s submission is that the standard practice hitherto adopted by the GDC can produce an unfair result in that the immediate consequence of an unsuccessful appeal can be that a registrant is given a period of suspension longer than that directed by the PCC and longer than the statutory maximum of 12 months under section 27B(6)(b).  A further consequence is the tendency to discourage or caution a registrant to exercise an unqualified right of appeal.  Even if the registrant does not exercise their right of appeal, the effect of the standard practice is to increase the total period of suspension by 28 days, because it begins on day 0 and ends 12 months and 28 days later.
The only means of challenging an immediate suspension order is pursuant to section 30(7) of the 1984 Act which entitles a registrant to seek a termination of the immediate suspension order.  In section 10 of the Appellant’s Notice to the High Court, the respondent sought such an order but the application could not be listed in advance of the appeal and fell to be determined by the judge.
Mr Kennedy described the judge’s decision as a humane attempt to resolve the problems which have been identified.  He stated that it was open to the court to say that the judge’s decision was not wrong.
The respondent contends that the judge was correct to conclude that an order for immediate suspension is “parasitic” upon the substantive direction for suspension.  Both actions are taken at the same stage of the fitness to practise process and both actions serve the same purpose namely protection of the public interest.  The judge was entitled to conclude that the combined effect of the direction and the order was wrong in principle and gave rise to the potential outcome that the respondent’s registration could be suspended for more than the 12 months statutory maximum.  Further, the judge was entitled to conclude that the PCC should have had in mind the potential for injustice and that once it had determined that an immediate order was necessary it should have directed that the time suspended by virtue of immediate order should be set off against the substantive direction for suspension.
The judge’s approach does not frustrate the purpose of remediation.  It will be for the registrant to assess the merits of any appeal and to decide whether or not to engage in or delay undertaking any remediation.  In the event that the appeal is unsuccessful, the registrant who has delayed undertaking remediation and then finds there is insufficient time in which to complete the same will be unsurprised were a PCC at a resumed hearing to impose a further period of suspension.
As to fairness to the registrant, there is no undermining of public confidence.  The public will be concerned to know that the registrant has been suspended not whether the suspension was achieved by operation of section 27C or section 30 of the 1984 Act.
The alternative mechanism of seeking an early review during a period of suspension does not counterbalance the unfairness of the established practice.  Neither the 1984 Act nor the Rules provide a mechanism whereby a registrant can seek, nor is there a power whereby the Registrar can direct an early review.
Discussion and conclusion
The PCC process and determination
The determination of the PCC is detailed, focused and clear.  It made findings of fact pursuant to the admissions of the respondent and made determinations of fact having considered the evidence.  It found that the facts proved under Heads of Charge 1, 3 and 5 were serious and individually met the threshold for misconduct.
In considering whether the respondent’s fitness to practise as a dentist was impaired by reason of misconduct, the PCC had regard to whether the misconduct was remediable, whether it had been remedied and took account of the respondent’s insight and the risk of repetition.  It also had regard to the wider public interest which includes a need to uphold and declare appropriate standards of conduct and behaviour, so as to maintain public confidence in the profession and its regulation (para 69).  The PCC considered the respondent’s conduct to be so serious that a fair minded and well informed member of the public would lose confidence in the profession and its regulation if no finding of impairment were to be made.  Accordingly, the PCC determined that the respondent’s fitness to practise as a dentist was currently impaired by reason of misconduct on both public protection and wider public interest grounds.  (para 78).
As to sanction, the PCC stated that to conclude the case with no further action or reprimand would be inappropriate owing to the risk of repetition and the seriousness of the misconduct.  (para 85).  Further, conditions could not be formulated which would be workable, measurable and proportionate and could not meaningfully address the attitudinal concerns to which the misconduct related nor would they protect the public.  (para 86).  The PCC concluded that erasure would be disproportionate as the respondent’s misconduct was remediable through further learning and reflection.  A period of suspension with a review would be sufficient to protect the patients and the public and to maintain wider public confidence in the profession.  Such a period would be sufficient to mark the seriousness of the respondent’s misconduct and to allow him further time within which to demonstrate further reflection and remediation and to develop insight into the impact into his behaviour.  (para 89).
Following the section 29B(6)(b) direction for substantive suspension, the PCC invited submissions on the issue of an immediate order of suspension. Following a short adjournment, the submissions were made.  The PCC determined that under section 30(1) of the 1984 Act it was necessary for the protection of the public and was otherwise in the public interest to order that the respondent’s registration be suspended forthwith. (para 92).
The procedure followed by the PCC was in accordance with the relevant provisions of the 1984 Act.  It reflected the overarching objective namely the protection of the public which includes promoting and maintaining public confidence in the profession and promoting and maintaining proper professional standards and conducts for members of the profession.  (section 1ZA and 1ZB of the 1984 Act).
The ground of appeal
The determination of the issue contained in the single ground of appeal is a matter of statutory interpretation of sections 27B, 29A and 30 of the 1984 Act.  It is from the statutory language that the intention of this legislation can be derived.  In my judgment, and as a matter of law and of fact, a direction for suspension and an order for immediate suspension are distinct.  The judge was wrong to treat the two periods resulting from a direction and an order as one continuous period of suspension.
The means whereby the two periods of suspension are imposed differs.  A substantive suspension imposed under section 27B(6)(b) is pursuant to a direction whereas the imposition of immediate suspension under section 30 is by means of an order.  The direction and any order are made at different stages of the fitness to practise process.  Until a direction has been given for erasure or for suspension (section 27B), the PCC has no power to make an order for immediate suspension (section 30).
As to the appellant’s contention that different tests are involved in the making of the direction and the order, I do not regard the point as clear cut.  The trigger for a direction under section 27B(6)(b) is the PCC’s determination that a person’s fitness to practise as a dentist is impaired.  The imposition of a direction of suspension would require consideration of the overarching objective namely the protection of the public which encompasses maintaining public confidence in the profession and promoting and maintaining proper professional standards.  An order is made under section 30 if the PCC is satisfied that to do so is necessary for the protection of the public or is otherwise in the public interest or is in the interest of the registrant.  I do not think there is a clear distinction between the two sets of considerations, as they can and do overlap.
When a direction for suspension takes effect is relevant.  Section 29A(2)(a)(b) and (c) identify when such a direction for suspension “shall take effect”.  The language is clear and mandatory.  Three events are identified as prescribing when the direction will come into effect practically, and each identifies the start of the period of suspension.  In my view there is no meaningful distinction between the words ‘take effect’ and ‘start’.  I do not accept that the absence of the word ‘start’ creates the difficulty envisaged by the judge.
As to the judge’s description of the section 30 powers as being “parasitic” on the section 27B direction for suspension, I disagree.  In my view, a better interpretation is that a direction made under section 27B, whether for erasure or suspension, is a condition precedent and until it is satisfied the powers under section 30 do not arise.  That they are wholly separate sections of the 1984 Act and dealt with at different stages of the fitness to practise procedure, is demonstrated by the language of the 1984 Act, the relevant Rules and by the procedure followed at the respondent’s fitness to practise hearing.
The language of section 30(1) indicates that the trigger for the immediate order of suspension is a direction under specific sections which includes section 27B(6)(b).  It states that registration shall be suspended forthwith, ie. when the suspension is to start.  There is nothing in section 30 which identifies a time limit for the duration of an order.  When such an order will end is set out in sections 30(3)(a), (b) and (c).  It follows and I find, that the wording of section 30 identifies the start and end dates of a period of immediate suspension.
The judge placed reliance on the point that section 27B(6)(b) identifies a maximum period of 12 months’ suspension.  That, however, is in respect only of a direction made under that section.  Section 27C(b) provides for an extension of the original period of substantive suspension and states that such further period should not exceed 12 months beginning on the date on which it would expire.  The purpose of this provision is to permit a PCC at a resumed/review hearing, should it determine that the fitness to practise of the dentist remains impaired, to impose a further period of suspension.  That is a course which is consistent with the overriding objective namely the protection of the public.
The 1984 Act makes no provision for an immediate order of suspension to be “set off” against the substantive sanction of suspension, a matter canvassed in the authorities of Ghosh and W v Health and Care Professions Tribunal (above).  Some judicial concern has been expressed as to the prolonging of the original suspension period but the courts have acknowledged that if this issue is to be ameliorated or altered it is a matter for Parliament.  In Khan v General Pharmaceutical Council [2017] 1 WLR 169 Lord Wilson recognised that a period of ‘interim’ (in fact immediate suspension) could not ‘count towards’ a period of substantive suspension when applying for restoration to the Register (para 22).
I accept the respondent’s point that once a section 30 order is made there is nothing in the statutory scheme which confers a power to direct a review of the suspension.  In practical terms, both the registrant or the GDC could apply to the PCC for an early review, the outcome of which would involve the exercise of discretion.
Conclusion
In my judgment the correct interpretation of the language of sections 27B, 29A and 30 of the 1984 Act is inconsistent with the reasoning of the judge and his conclusion that only one period of suspension is imposed.  If the judge was correct in his interpretation of the sections, it would undermine the overriding objective which underpins the provisions governing PCC hearings.  It has the potential to undermine the ability of a registrant to remediate the failings which led to the finding of misconduct, one purpose of a review hearing.  It could also negate the purpose of a review directed under section 27B(6)(b) as such a review may not occur if the combined period of a directed and ordered suspension exceeded 12 months.  Thus, a dentist subject to a review, could return to practice without satisfying a PCC that their fitness to practise was no longer impaired.  This would ride roughshod over the carefully drafted provisions of the 1984 Act which at their core reflect the need to protect the public.  Put shortly, the judge’s interpretation of these provisions of the 1984 Act was wrong.  It follows that Morris J was correct in his interpretation of these sections.
Finally, should a judge choose to raise a point not advocated for by either party, which is contrary to the established practice of a professional disciplinary tribunal and which has implications which go beyond the parameters of the instant case, the fair and sensible course would be to invite the parties to provide both written and full oral submissions before any determination is made by the court.
Accordingly, and for the reasons given, I would allow this appeal.
Lord Justice Stuart-Smith:
I agree that this appeal should be allowed for the reasons given by Nicola Davies LJ and in accordance with the analysis of Morris J in Danial.  I only add to them because we are differing from the Judge below in circumstances where there are conflicting decisions at the level of the High Court.
Briefly, there is no basis for aggregating the substantive suspension and the immediate suspension and then treating the aggregated period as if it had been passed as a single substantive suspension.  They are clearly different.  The substantive suspension is imposed by a direction pursuant to section 27(B)(6)(b) and it is that direction that is not to exceed 12 months (though, as Nicola Davies LJ has pointed out, there are other provisions by which the initially directed period may be extended pursuant to section 27C).  An appeal against such a direction may be brought pursuant to section 29.
I do not understand what the Judge meant by saying that an order for immediate suspension is “parasitic” upon a direction imposing a substantive suspension.  I agree with Nicola Davies LJ that a direction imposing a substantive suspension is a necessary pre-requisite to an order for an immediate suspension; but that does not seem to me to give meaning to the word “parasitic” in this context.
An order for immediate suspension is made pursuant to section 30 and is not subject to the time limit of 12 months mentioned in section 27B(6)(b), which is specific to a direction under that subsection that there should be a substantive suspension. The duration of an immediate suspension is determined by section 30(3) There is a clear difference between the two procedures.  With a substantive suspension pursuant to section 27B(6)(b), what is done is that the registrar is directed to amend the register.  With an immediate suspension, the order does not require any action by the registrar for the order to be effective.  An order for immediate suspension is not susceptible to an appeal pursuant to section 29; but it is open to a dentist in respect of whom an immediate suspension has been ordered to apply to the court for an order terminating it: see section 30(7), which has been set out by Nicola Davies LJ above.
The word “start” does not appear in the operative provisions of the Act.  Instead, the Act uses the phrase “take effect” on multiple occasions.  We are directly concerned with its use in section 29A and 30.  Section 29A(2) provides that a direction imposing a substantive suspension shall “take effect” (a) where no appeal under section 29 is brought on the expiry of 28 days and (b) where an appeal is brought then, depending on the outcome of the appeal, either on it being withdrawn of struck out or dismissed.  To my mind this provision is entirely clear: “take effect” means that the substantive suspension (in this case, of 9 months) would become effective and start to run from 28 days after the direction was made (if no appeal was brought) or on determination of the appeal (if, as happened, there was one).   There is no basis for adopting a different meaning for “take effect” in section 30(3).  It therefore means that, in a case where an order for immediate suspension is made, the substantive suspension will still become effective and start to run in accordance with the provisions of section 29A, and the immediate suspension will simply last until that date.  There is nothing in these provisions to suggest that there should be any form of set off against the duration of the substantive suspension attributable to the gap-filling effect of the immediate suspension.  To my mind, these provisions are directly contrary to the interpretation adopted by the Judge and there is no basis for the court to go behind them.  I should add for completeness that there are numerous other occasions where “take effect” is used, and their meaning is, to my mind, obviously the same as I have paraphrased above: see sections 27B(10), 27C(1)(a), 29A(3), 30(5), 32(7), 33(3), 33(4)  and 33A.  It is not necessary to set them all out here.
I agree that there is a degree of overlap between the criteria for making a direction for a substantive suspension and the criteria for imposing an immediate suspension.  That is not surprising given the overarching objective of the Council: see Section 1 of the Dentists Act, as set out by Nicola Davies LJ above.  That does not suggest that the two provisions for suspensions should be aggregated and treated as if they were all imposed pursuant to a direction for a substantive suspension.
Finally, although I accept that the interpretation that we are endorsing may have the effect of extending the period during which a dentist’s registration is suspended, that does not seem to me to be either unfair or contrary to the public interest.  It is always open to the dentist to request a review of his case before the conclusion of the period of the substantive suspension or for the Council in an appropriate case to initiate the review itself.  As always, the touchstone will be the protection of the public.
For these reasons, which are essentially the same as those explained by Nicola Davies LJ, I too would allow the appeal.
Lady Justice Whipple:

LORD JUSTICE COULSON
LORD JUSTICE COULSON and MRS JUSTICE CUTTS DBE:
INTRODUCTION
This is the judgment of the court, to which we have both contributed. There are two matters for us to decide: the substantive application for a fresh inquest, and the application to get over a fundamental procedural problem that has occurred. Unless there is an answer to the latter, our conclusions as to the former may not matter.
THE SUBSTANTIVE APPLICATION
The substantive application is made pursuant to section 13(1)(b) of the Coroners Act 1988 (“the Act”), to quash the original inquest and for the court to direct a fresh inquest to be held into the death of Mr Anthony Joseph Whittle (“the deceased”). The application is made by the deceased’s brother, Mr Christopher Whittle, on the basis that it is necessary or, in the alternative desirable, in the interests of justice that another investigation be held, as there was insufficient inquiry at the original inquest.
As required by section 13 of the Act, the Attorney General’s authority was sought and a fiat granted on 5 January 2024.
As was clear from the submissions to the Attorney General dated 26 October 2023, the defendant, HM Coroner for North West Wales, agrees that, in the interests of justice, a fresh inquest is necessary or at the very least, desirable. Mr Pojur confirmed that in his oral submissions today. In submissions to the Attorney General made on the same date, Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board (“the Health Board”), the first of the interested parties, indicated that they were neutral on the application, in circumstances where there are no longer any medical or staff records retained from the material time. Again, Mr Naughton confirmed that at the hearing today. In an email dated 3 February 2025, the Chief Constable of North Wales, the second interested party, has adopted a neutral position.
The Original Inquest
The original inquest was heard at Bangor Coroner’s Court in the Eryri District of Gwynedd (now North West Wales) on 22 February 1995.
As to the time, place and circumstances at or in which injury was sustained, the Coroner recorder in box 3 of the Inquisition: “Deceased had been admitted to the psychiatric unit at Ysbyty Gwynedd, Bangor but left through the window of an interview room and climbed over the roof and away. He was found the following morning flat on his back on a concrete track underneath a bridge carrying the A55 expressway. He was found at 7.50 AM on 25 November 1994.”
The Coroner recorded an “open verdict, there being no evidence to show how he came to be where he was found.”
The Apparent Facts and Circumstances
The deceased was born on 3 November 1964 and aged 30 years at the time of his death. In his late teens he was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia. His medical history included an attempt to take his own life and two occasions of having been sectioned under the Mental Health Act.
In October 1994, the deceased began a forestry degree at the University of Wales in Bangor, Gwynedd. His family recall that, although he initially seemed to settle well, by the end of November he was frequently phoning home and was often tearful. On 24 November 1994 he failed to meet his father and brother at a train station as agreed. They drove to Bangor to find him. They found his flat in disarray, his belongings packed and signs of minor drug use. A scribbled note on his desk read “the devil is coming to kill me but god will protect me.”
The police had located the deceased on Prestatyn Beach and taken him to the police station in Rhyl. The family report that the police told his father and brother that he had been found wandering on the sand dunes and caravan park wearing only one sock. He was described as very frantic, quite frightened and constantly screaming or crying. He was saying that the devil was going to kill him but god was with him to guide him to the fishing boat and that he could walk on water. The deceased’s family were told that he had been seen by a doctor at the police station and transferred to Bangor Hospital for assessment.
At 11.30 PM the deceased’s father and brother saw him with a psychiatrist, Dr McMonagle, at the Hergest Unit at Gwynedd Hospital. They noted him to be dishevelled, quiet and melancholic. The doctor told them that he was seriously ill and required further psychiatric evaluation before being discharged. They recall that he hugged them both and was escorted to his room. When the deceased’s father asked if they could take him home, the doctor said he would speak to the deceased. He returned to say that the deceased had decided to stay at the hospital for treatment.
The deceased’s father and brother then heard a loud bang. They were informed that he had broken a window, climbed down a sloping roof and left. The claimant disputes the assertion, understood to have been given by Dr McMonagle at the original inquest, that the deceased had signed himself out of the unit.
The deceased was found the next morning, 25 November 1994, by a passing cyclist under the North Wales Expressway close to the Halfway Bridge and the village of Llandygai.
The Legal FrameworkSection 13 Coroners Act 1988
This section, insofar as is relevant, as amended provides:
This section applies where…under the authority of the Attorney-General the High Court is satisfied as respects a coroner (“the coroner concerned”) either –
….(b) where an inquest or an investigation has been held by him, that (whether by reason of fraud, rejection of evidence, irregularity of proceedings, insufficiency of inquiry, the discovery of new facts or evidence or otherwise) it is necessary or desirable in the interests of justice that an investigation (or as the case may be, another investigation) should be held.
The High Court may –
order an investigation under part 1 of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 to be held into the death
…
by a senior coroner, area coroner or assistant coroner in the coroner area
…
where an inquest has been held, quash any inquisition on, or determination or finding made at that inquest.”
In HM Attorney General v HM Coroner South Yorkshire and others [2012] EWHC 3783 the court held that the single question for the High Court is whether the interests of justice make a further inquest either necessary or desirable. It is not necessary for the court to anticipate that a different verdict will be returned.
The “simple starting point” for an insufficient inquiry, as stated in R (O’Reilly) v HM Coroner for Coventry (1996) 160 JP 746, is an inquiry which leaves too many questions unanswered and too many issues unresolved.
The current test for causation is whether an act or omission more than minimally, trivially or negligently contributed to the death: see R (Tainton) v HM Senior Coroner for Preston [2016] EWHC 1396 at [41].
Finally, we note that, if a fresh inquest was resumed under Article 2 of the ECHR, an operational duty may be owed to a voluntary psychiatric inpatient as well as a patient detained under the Mental Health Act 1983: see Rabone v Pennine Care NHS Foundation Trust [2012] UKSC 2.
Ground for Application
The sole ground relied upon in this application is that there was an insufficient inquiry into the deceased’s death at the original inquest into the following:
The risk the deceased posed to himself;
Whether the deceased required formal detention under the Mental Health Act 1983;
Whether the deceased was, in fact, detained despite his formal status as a voluntary patient;
Whether acts or omissions by Dr McMonagle and other staff caused or contributed to the death of the deceased;
How, as a matter of fact, the deceased was able to abscond from a psychiatric unit through a window and
The steps taken (if any) to search for the deceased following his absconsion.”
The existence or otherwise of medical records will be a matter for the coroner. Even assuming that the evidence did not change at all, which is said to be unlikely, the probability or even possibility of a different conclusion means that a fresh inquest is necessary/desirable in the interests of justice.
Submissions of Defendant (HM Coroner for North West Wales)
As we have already said, HM Coroner for North West Wales accepts that there was insufficiency of inquiry at the original inquest and supports the application to quash that inquest and order a fresh one.
She also accepts that the question of whether the deceased was effectively detained at the hospital is important, and potentially relevant to whether Article 2 of the ECHR could be engaged at a new inquest.  The obligations thereunder were not in existence at the time of the original inquest, as the Human Rights Act 1998 came into force in October 2000, incorporating the rights and liberties contained in the ECHR into domestic law. If it were to be an Article 2 compliant inquest, the enhanced investigation, in addition to the four statutory questions common to all inquests (being who the deceased was and when, how and where he came by his death), would have to examine in what circumstances the deceased came by his death. In any event, a full and fearless inquiry would need to address the factual matrix of his mental health deterioration, including conversations with his fellow student and police surgeon, his movements the previous day, and activities during the 24 and 25 November 1994, all against the backdrop of his mental health diagnosis when he was younger.
Important questions are whether the deceased was detained, whether he had capacity, how he was able to escape, what action was taken by the hospital to recover him, what the high risk strategy being instituted was, and what was done by the police in order to locate someone about whom they also had concerns. These aspects would be required to be determined for it to be a meaningful inquest, particularly for the family.
In the view of HM Coroner for North West Wales, these are core issues in any fresh inquest, and the coroner would be expected to examine and determine each of them with a finding of fact. Even if a fresh inquest is not necessaryin the interests of justice, the same factors mean that it would be desirablefor there to be a fresh inquest. She is of the view that a meaningful inquest can be conducted, even if some issues remain ultimately unresolved and even where there may be no access to records and statements due to the passage of time.
Conclusion on Substantive Application
We are grateful for the helpful submissions from both the claimant, defendant and first interested party. We are satisfied that, for all the reasons that they have set out, there was an insufficiency of inquiry at the original inquest, in that the coroner failed to address and make findings of fact on important questions concerning the circumstances of Mr Anthony Whittle’s death.
We are satisfied in those circumstances that a fresh inquest is not only desirable but necessary in the interests of justice. We therefore turn to address the procedural position, to see if meaningful effect can be given to that conclusion.
THE PROCEDURAL POSITION
As noted above, s.13(1) of the Coroners Act 1988 enables the High Court to grant a claim for a fresh inquest “on an application…under the authority of the Attorney-General”. Practice Direction 49E, at paragraph 20.3, states that for an application under s.13, “the claim form must… (2) be filed at the Administrative Courts; and (3) be served upon all persons directly affected by the application within six weeks of grant of Attorney-General’s fiat”.
In this case the Attorney General’s fiat was issued on 5 January 2024. The six weeks therefore expired on 16 February 2024. The Part 8 claim form and accompanying documents were filed in person at the Bristol Civic Justice Centre on 14 February 2024. Also on 14 February, unsealed copies of the claim form and application were served on HM Coroner for North West Wales, and the two interested parties.
The claim form was not issued by the court by 16 February 2024. It appears that Bristol Civic Justice Centre subsequently said that the documents should have been filed by way of CE File. The claim form and accompanying documents were refiled and issued on 7 March 2024.
The claimant’s solicitors immediately acknowledged that they were out of time because the 16 February date had not been met. On 7 March, they made an application seeking “permission to issue Part 8 proceedings outside of the 6 week deadline of 16 February 2024”. The accompanying statement from Ms Scheel, the senior partner with the claimant’s solicitors, sought relief from sanctions. It was not clear from the papers whether the sealed claim form, issued on 7 March, had ever been served. Ms Noyce confirmed in answer to a question from the court that the sealed claim form was served on the defendant, HM Coroner for North West Wales, on or about 10 June 2024, together with the application for a fresh inquest dated 24 May 2024.
The proceedings have had anything but a charmed life thereafter. They were transferred by Master Dagnall, without a hearing, from the King’s Bench Division to the Administrative Court on 22 April 2024. It seems the case was transferred to Cardiff and then came back to London. Lengthy delays have ensued since the application for a new inquest was formally made on 24 May 2024. None of those delays can be attributed to the parties.
Despite that, however, there are a number of real problems with the claimant’s procedural position. First, the making of an application to issue the proceedings out of time was, with respect, misconceived. The claim form was issued by the court office on 7 March 2024: it bears a stamp to that effect. It has therefore been issued. The issue date cannot somehow be retrospectively altered.
Moreover, the application for relief from sanctions was wrong in law. R (Good Law Project) v SoS for Health and Social Care [2022] EWCA Civ 355 at [79] is authority for the proposition that the principles in respect of relief from sanctions, and the well-known authority of Denton v TH White Limited [2014] 1WLR 3927, do not apply to the service of an originating process like a Part 8 claim form. This has been confirmed more recently in SoS for Levelling Up, Housing & Communities v Rogers [2024] EWCA Civ 1554 at [20].
The problem here is an entirely different one. On the face of it, the sealed claim form should have been served by 16 February. It was not, because it had not been issued. Either the claimant needs to persuade us that the service of the unsealed claim form on 14 February was sufficient for the purposes of PD 49E, or he requires permission to serve the sealed claim form out of time (essentially, an extension of time). In addition, there is Ms Noyce’s new argument, revealed yesterday afternoon, to the effect that Master Dagnall must be “impliedly” taken to have granted relief from sanctions when he transferred the case to the Administrative Court in April 2024.
Service of the Unsealed Claim Form
The first question is whether, under PD49E, valid service can be effected with an unsealed claim form. If so, since the unsealed claim form was served in time, the claimant does not require any assistance from the court.
The insurmountable difficulty with that argument is that all the provisions in the CPR anticipate the service of an issued claim form: see in particular r.7.5(1) and (2). Moreover, Ideal Shopping Direct Ltd v Mastercard Inc [2022] EWCA Civ 14 is authority for the proposition that, for the purposes of the provisions in the CPR dealing with methods of service, a claim form “is the original document issued by the court on which the court seal is placed”.Sir Julian Flaux made that plain at [137], and went on at [144] to find that unsealed documents are not claim forms within the CPR. Thus, in the present case, the service of the unsealed claim form on 14 February 2024 was not good service.
Under r.6.15, we wondered whether the court could retrospectively authorise service by an alternative method, namely the service of the unsealed claim form. The fundamental problem with that option is that, as set out above, proper service can only be of the sealed claim form. The defect here was precisely the same defect which the claimant could not get round in Ideal Shopping, namely the service of an unsealed claim form. Furthermore, whilst r.6.15 does allow consideration of alternative methods of service, that is concerned with howservice is effected, not the defects in that which is purportedly being served.
Accordingly, effective service did not take place on 14 February. It had not occurred by 16 February, which was the relevant expiry date. It occurred on or about 2024-June-10.
Other Potential Solutions
We also wondered whether, under r.6.16(1), the court could dispense with service of the claim form altogether. We have considered that, but we do not think we can. It would, we think, be wrong in principle to dispense with service altogether in a case where the time limit expressly expired on service. In addition, the authorities are firmly against that course: Anderton v Clwyd CC (No.2) [2002] EWCA Civ 933 says that a court cannot dispense with service where no attempt was made to serve the sealed claim form in time; and Kuenyehia v International Hospitals Group Ltd [2006] EWCA Civ 21 suggests that the power to dispense with service altogether is unlikely to be exercised unless some attempt has been made to serve by a permitted method.
The last option would be for this court to extend time for service pursuant to r.7.6(3)(b). There are some difficulties with that too: there is no formal application for an extension of time, and so rather limited evidence about whether the claimant’s solicitors took all reasonable steps to serve timeously.
On the other hand, there are some elements of the evidence which suggest that time for the service of the claim form should be extended. We consider that the fact that the documents were filed with the court in time is a strong point in favour of an extension. So too is the fact that the unsealed claim form was served before the deadline, and the fact that, on the same day as they received the stamped claim form, the claimant’s solicitors tried to rectify the position by making their application for relief. Moreover, we consider that the court office should have said on 14 February that the documents could only be filed on CE File: if HMCTS wish to adopt an entirely paper-free process, the least they can do is to explain that to a court user, who bothers to attend personally to file a paper claim. The relevant delay therefore occurred at the court office and nowhere else.
We accept that, in another sort of case, those facts alone may not justify an application to extend time for service under r.7.6(3)(b): Rogers, and the cases cited there, make that clear. But there is a unique feature of this case which does not exist in any of the reported cases.  In all those cases, the defendant saw a positive advantage in seeking to rely on the failure to serve in time. That failure might give rise to a limitation defence. It might mean the end of a large claim that the defendant would otherwise have had to meet. A defendant in those circumstances has every incentive to rely on the procedural failings of the claimant and resist an extension of time for service. Where the service point is hotly disputed, the court must strike a balance between the parties.
But that is not this case. Here, there is no limitation issue. Here, the defendant does not challenge the need for a fresh inquest; indeed, she encourages the court to order a fresh inquest. Moreover, it is plain, for the reasons that we have given, that the interests of justice require a fresh inquest. In all those circumstances, there is nothing whatsoever to be gained by this court refusing to extend time for service. The claimant may lose his ability to claim altogether. Or he may have to start the process all over again, with the raft of additional time and expense which that would bring with it.
Furthermore, we have in mind the overriding objective (r.1.1). In circumstances where the application is not challenged, it seems to us that it would be a triumph of procedure over substance if an extension of time for service was not granted in the very particular circumstances of this case. Such an outcome would not be just or proportionate.
Whilst that conclusion means that we do not strictly need to express a view about Ms Noyce’s argument that the order for transfer to the Administrative Court impliedly granted relief from sanctions, we should say that, in our view, that submission was wholly without foundation. First, for the reasons already advertised, relief from sanctions is inappropriate and irrelevant when dealing with the service of originating proceedings. Secondly, the application for relief, which talked about obtaining permission to issue out of time, was itself misconceived because the claim form is issued by the court, not the solicitors, and had been issued anyway. Master Dagnall would therefore have had no jurisdiction to grant relief from sanctions in such a case. Thirdly, this cannot have been an argument that had occurred to the claimant’s solicitors, let alone one that was relied on by them, since Ms Scheel’s second witness statement of 25 May 2024, sworn after the transfer order, referred to the ongoing application for relief from sanctions, and did not suggest that that had been dealt with by Master Dagnall. Fourthly, it is wrong to suggest that, simply because a transfer was ordered at a time when an application for relief from sanctions was outstanding, everything that had happened before the transfer was somehow magically regularised. There is no authority for such a proposition. Fifthly, there is nothing to suggest that Master Dagnall gave – or should have given - any consideration to this procedural tangle. He simply transferred the case and gave liberty to apply.
CONCLUSIONS
For the reasons set out in paragraphs 27-45 above, we order that time for service of the sealed claim form on the defendant is extended to 12 June 2024. Out of an abundance of caution, time for service of the sealed claim form on the interested parties is extended to 29 January 2025.
For the reasons set out in paragraphs 2-26 above, pursuant to section 13 of the Coroners Act 1988, we quash the Record of Inquest and quash the findings and conclusions of the inquest in the case of Anthony Whittle dated 22 February 1995. We order a new investigation under Part 1 of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 to be held into the death of Anthony Whittle by a senior coroner, area coroner or assistant coroner in the coroner area.

Appellant/Defendant
- and –
NADRA TABASAM ALMAS
Respondent/Claimant
Julie Anderson of counsel (instructed by the Government Legal Department) for the Appellant
Zainul Jafferji of counsel (Direct Access) for the Respondent
Hearing date: 22.1.2025
APPROVED JUDGMENT
This judgment was handed down remotely at 10.00am on Tuesday 2025-February-4 by circulation to the parties or their representatives by e-mail and by release to the National Archives.
Mr Justice Ritchie:
The parties
The Appellant/Defendant is the Secretary of State for the Home Department and is responsible for immigration decisions. The Respondent/Claimant is a member of the public who was detained pending imminent removal by the Appellant and then released and whose fresh claim application for asylum took the Appellant 2 years and 9 months to determine.
Bundles
For the hearing I was provided with an appeal bundle, two authorities bundles and two skeleton arguments.
Summary of the claim, decision below and appeal
The Claimant sued the Defendant for unlawful detention (the UD claim) alleging that on 9.4.2018 she was detained unlawfully when she was reporting to the Defendant under her immigration reporting conditions. She was released on 23.4.2018 after she provided fresh submissions to the Defendant to justify her claim for asylum. The Claimant also claimed damages for breach of her right to family life under Article 8 of the European Convention of Human Rights (ECHR) and the Human Rights Act 1998 (the Art. 8 claim) because, during the delay period during which the Defendant made a decision on her fresh asylum application which took 2 years and 9 months, she was under restrictive conditions: (1) preventing her from working or earning anything and requiring her: (2) not to travel, (3) to live at one address, and (4) to report monthly.
At the trial the Claimant gave evidence and the Defendant relied on a witness statement from an employee who had no part in the decision making processes relating to the Claimant.  The Defendant applied during the trial for an adjournment to put in more evidence but this was refused. The refusal was not appealed.  Recorder McNeill allowed the claim on both grounds, awarded damages totalling £98,757.04, awarded indemnity costs to the Claimant and ordered a payment on account of costs of £30,000.
The Defendant/Appellant puts forwards 6 grounds of appeal based on errors of law seeking to set aside the Recorder’s decisions on liability, quantum and costs. Permission was granted (I think) by Julian Knowles J on 30.7.2024 at a renewal hearing (the name of the judge is not stated on the face of the Order so it is defective as a matter of form but neither party took the point, so I move on).  The Order set out the slightly restricted scope of the grounds which were permitted, so that various procedural grounds were omitted from permission but the asserted errors of law were permitted to go forwards.  No application to expand permission was made by the Appellant.
Appeals - CPR 52
Review of the decision
Under CPR r. 52.21 this appeal is a review of the decision of the lower Court, not a rehearing and will only be granted if the decision below was wrong or unjust due to a serious procedural or other irregularity.  In this appeal the Appellant asserts in the grounds that the relevant decisions were wrong.
Fresh Evidence
This appeal is restricted to the evidence before the lower Court unless, under CPR r. 52.21(2), an application is made to adduce new evidence and this Court grants it.  No such application was made.
Findings of fact and credibility
I take into account the decisions in Henderson v Foxworth [2014] UKSC 41, per Lord Reed at [67]; Grizzly Business v Stena Drilling [2017] EWCA Civ. 94, per Longmore LJ at [39-40] and Deutsche Bank AG v Sebastian Holdings [2023] EWCA Civ. 191, by Lord Justice Males at [48] - [55], that any challenges to findings of fact in the Court below have to pass a high threshold test.  The trial Judge had the benefit of hearing and seeing the witnesses which this appellate Court does not. The Appellant needs to show the Judge was wrong in the sense that there was no sufficient evidence upon which the decision could have been reached or that no reasonable Judge could have reached that decision, or that the Judge took into account an irrelevant matter or failed to take into account a material and relevant matter.  Two deferential principles are applied. Firstly, where the trial judge heard and saw the evidence being given live over the course of the trial he/she was better placed to assess the evidence than the appellate court is having only the transcript an documents.  Secondly, there is a generous ambit for disagreement allowed on such findings.  The threshold for appeals against findings of fact was summarised by Lord Justice Lewison in Volpi v Volpi [2022] EWCA Civ. 464, [2022] 4 WLR 48, at paras. 2-4 and 52.  No appeal was raised as to the findings of fact of the Recorder.
Case management decisions
Appeals against case management decisions likewise face a high threshold and I note that there was no appeal in this case against the Recorder’s decision to refuse to adjourn the trial for the Defendant to obtain and rely on further evidence.
Unchallenged findings of fact by the Recorder
The Claimant was born in Pakistan and came to the UK on a student visa in 2004. This expired after 5 months but she stayed. In February 2008 she was served with a notice of removal. Between 2005 and 2014 she made 6 applications, which I have not seen, for permission to remain.  The Defendant issued a notice of temporary admission at one stage. She was informed that she could not work or run a business, had to live at a specified address and had to report. She complied diligently with the reporting requirements and other conditions. The Claimant’s Asylum claim was refused in March 2015. It was certified as clearly unfounded. The Claimant submitted a fresh claim on 15.5.2015. The Recorder noted the Defendant’s policy which required that claim to be made in person in Liverpool (she lived in Leicester). The Claimant sent more submissions in 2017 asking to be excused from personal submissions to Liverpool. The Defendant did not reply.  At paras. 6-7 the Recorder made findings of fact on the asserted 2015/2017 fresh claim and how the fresh claim and later submissions were handled. The Defendant had breached its own processes and kept the claim on file (rather than rejecting it and sending it back or accepting it and determining the application) but did nothing about it and did not return the claim or submissions or decide them. On 30.1.2018, the Claimant’s son, who was born in February 1991, was granted asylum by the FTT on appeal from a decision of the Defendant and on the basis of evidence which included the Claimant’s unchallenged evidence. The decision was given to the son (and the Claimant) in February 2018. He was therefore granted refugee status (which occurred 3 months later due to administrative matters). It was an agreed fact that in March 2018 the Claimant rejected the Defendant’s offer to leave the UK permanently. Despite the pleasure of her son’s result, on 2018-April-9 things did not go as the Claimant expected when she reported to the reporting centre (EMRC). She was handcuffed and detained, imprisoned in a room with two men she did not know and was told she was going to be flown back to Pakistan on 17.4.2018.
The Recorder’s key findings of fact about the Claimant’s detention on 2018-April-9 were as follows. I note that GCID means General Computer Information Database.
On 26 March 2018, a note was made on the GCID evidencing planned detention of the claimant at EMRC on 9 April 2018. A brief summary of the claimant’s immigration history was set out. It was noted that the claimant had been offered voluntary departure on 24 March 2015 and on 13 March 2018, but had not left the UK. It was stated there were no barriers to removal. Removability was assessed as high but absconding was assessed as low, and indeed was still assessed as low on 2 April 2018 in another note, as the claimant was compliant with reporting. It was reported in the case notes that the claimant had high blood pressure for which she took medication. In answer to the question: “What alternatives have been considered for detention?”, the answer given was: “Subject has not voluntarily left the UK”. This was not an answer to the question posed, and I concluded that no consideration was given to possible alternatives to detention.
The section for reasons for recommending detention was left blank, as was the section for completion by the detention gatekeeper to give their decision and reasons. The section for onward action plan was also left blank. A further note, dated 2 April 2018, contained similar omissions. In short, there was no evidence before me either that the defendant considered alternatives to detention or that there was any reason for the decision to detain the claimant beyond that she was to be imminently removed.
I will come to the specific wording of the decision in a moment, but on 9 April 2018 and in accordance with the plan recorded in the notes, the claimant was detained on reporting at EMRC. She was with her son. He was not detained. The only recorded reason for her detention was that she was at high risk of absconding. The defendant submitted that this decision was based on a recognised escalation risk given that there was now no other disposal than removal. There was no direct evidence to this effect, but clearly the claimant’s imminent removal was the only reason for treating her as being at high risk of absconding. No other reason was given.
On being detained, the claimant was inducted at Yarl’s Wood. It was stated that it was ensured that she understood the reasons why she was in detention and it was explained how the case would progress during her stay, and the role of the contact management team of the RIC. The claimant stated that she did not wish to return to Pakistan. She stated her son was aged over 18 and resided in the UK, and she wanted to stay here with him. She also stated she arrived in the UK in 2004 and she feared for her safety if she returned to Pakistan, as she is a Christian. In the GCID note of 10 April 2018 it was recorded as follows:
“This case was considered an imminent removable case by the Gatekeeper. After reviewing the case on CID removal appears imminent. Am waiting to review the Home Office file to confirm this.
... The subject has no barriers to removal.”
It stated that the subject was served with an enforcement notice and assertive letter. She could depart using an agreed ETD and had RDs (removal directions) in place, set for 17 April. In spite of the reference to “waiting to review the Home Office file”, there was no evidence that the file was reviewed. If it had been reviewed, the letter of 15 May 2015 and the 2017 submissions would doubtless have been seen.” (My emboldening).
I should mention here that a note dated 9.4.2018 recorded that the Defendant served removal directions (RDs) on the Claimant for a flight on 17.4.2018.
The Recorder went on to find that the Defendant reviewed detention at 24 hours. The legal basis for continued detention was stated as para.16(2) of Schedule 2 of the Immigration Act 1971 (the power to detain persons liable for removal) and the Claimant was due to be removed on 17.4.2018. The reason for detention was found by the Recorder as follows:
“13 … In section 4, in relation to the risk of absconding, the reviewing officer did not specifically indicate whether the risk was high, medium or low, but stated that the subject, “is likely to abscond if released as will be aware removal is imminent as RD’s set”. There was no ticking or crossing of the boxes for high, medium or low risk, but that was the reason stated. The only reasonable inference that can be drawn from this note, in the absence of any witness being called to explain the reasoning, is that the reason for assessing the claimant as likely to abscond was simply that she would be aware that removal was imminent if she was released. This interpretation is reinforced by a further note, “maintained detention as IR case”, which I take to mean an imminent removal case. This suggests that no  consideration was given to the claimant’s particular circumstances in  deciding whether she was likely to abscond. The imminence of removal, without more, led to the conclusion that the claimant was likely to abscond.
The defendant accepted that the claimant had a good record of compliance with reporting. The 24-hour review was carried out by an individual at EO (executive officer) grade, and continued detention was agreed. The form should have been completed by an authorising officer. This was not done. The appropriate authorisation for detention, I find, was not given.”
The Recorder found that the 7 day review took place on 16.4.2018 and the risk was then dropped to “medium” and the Claimant’s further submissions were noted.  Recorder found:
… It was noted under the heading “Recommendations”, that the presumption was in favour of release, but that “case circumstances have been reviewed and continued detention remains appropriate and proportionate”. It was further stated that there were “strong grounds for believing the subject would fail to comply with any restrictions on release, namely overstaying and failing to depart when required”. It was stated that the risk of absconding was heightened due to the late stage of the case, and that these factors outweighed the presumption in favour of release. Detention was recommended as RDs were imminent.”
At that review the RDs were not “imminent” they had long since been given to the Claimant. The Recorder recited the Defendant’s detention policy at paras. 16-19 referencing that it stated that for detention to be lawful it had to accord with the statutory powers, the case law and accord with the published policy.  The Recorder then set out parts of Paras. 55.3.1, 55.5 and 55.6.2 of the policy and further the paragraphs setting out the requirement to complete forms IS91 and IS91R evidencing the justification for the decision/s to detain and the requirement for these to be signed by the appropriate senior staff and to keep proper copies. Then the Recorder made findings as to the numerous breaches of the policy at paras. 20 – 26.  These were: (1) lack of explanation for detention; (2) inconsistent decisions on the risk of absconding (low then none then high then medium) without explanation, which the Recorder found was unreasonable given the Claimant’s good history of reporting; (3) the IS91 and IS91R forms were unsigned and undated. By 16.4.2018 the notes recorded that the RDs had been cancelled yet the Defendant did not release the Claimant. The notes recorded that the RDs would have been deferred anyway due to the Claimant’s further submissions (which she lodged on 11, 12 and 13.4.2018) which amounted to a fresh claim and were based on her son’s successful appeal to the FTT and her evidence there and referred back to her 2017 submissions (the year before) and which all needed to be considered. Despite this note the Claimant was detained for a further 7 days and only released on 23.4.2018 and the Defendant provided no explanation or justification for that further detention.
Stopping here, not only was there no appeal against the findings of fact relating to the period from 16.4.2018-23.4.2018, but there was no argument put forwards on appeal that detention during that week was lawful. The appeal focussed on the initial detention and the review at 24 hours. This approach rather overlooked what was, in effect, an acceptance by the Defendant that the Recorder was right as to unlawful detention, in relation to the period from 16.4.2018 for the next 6-7 days.
In paras. 23-26 the Recorder accepted the Claimant’s evidence from her witness statement dated 23.9.2022 and her live evidence. I shall not repeat the findings here. It was noted that the Defendant called no evidence in relation to the 33 month period of delay before making the decision and granting her fresh asylum claim.
The Recorder’s rulings
Having set out the law based on the submissions made to her at paras. 27-40, the Recorder made the following rulings. On the false imprisonment (unlawful detention or UD) claim, the Recorder considered the competing submissions about whether there was any barrier to removal arising from the 2015 and 2017 submissions and made no finding on that issue (paras 43-44). Instead, she relied at paras. 45-49 on the Defendant’s breaches of its own policy to justify her finding that the initial detention was unlawful. The breaches which she found were:
Firstly and fundamentally, the Defendant did not consider any alternatives to detention before or when making the detention decisions. This ruling arose from her findings that the IS91R, IS91 and the GCID notes did not contain any such consideration. The Defendant provided no other evidence so that is all the Court had.
Secondly, the only given reason for detention was the risk of absconding and the Recorder found that:
“46 … This was not explained. It is not enough simply to assert that someone is likely to abscond just because their removal is imminent, and there was no evidence before me that indicated that anything else was taken into account. A rational and considered decision on the risk of absconding should be taken. The fact that this risk went from low on 2 April, where already the detention on 9 April was being planned, to then becoming high and then being medium seems to lack any rationale. On the evidence, it appears to have been concluded, solely on the basis that there was an imminent removal planned, that the claimant was therefore at high risk of absconding. That decision did not involve any consideration of factors specific to the claimant as envisaged in the defendant’s own policies.”
Thirdly, the Defendant failed to complete and sign the appropriate authority to detain.
Fourthly, the Defendant failed to keep proper records of its decisions.
The Recorder ruled that these breaches were numerous and significant (para. 48) so the detention was unlawful (para. 49) and the continuation of the detention at 24 hours and 7 days were unlawful. There was no evidence that the decision was properly authorised on 10.4.2018 and after the RDs were withdrawn, on 16.4.2018, there could be no legitimate continuation of detention beyond minor administration delays if any necessary to release.
In relation to the Art. 8 claim, in paras. 50-58 the Recorder set out the pleaded and pursued basis of the infringements of the Claimant’s Art 8 rights as follows:
“Her case was set out in her particulars of claim, where she said that throughout the period alleged she was required to comply with restrictions placed on her residence in the UK, and she was not permitted to travel, live freely and develop her private and family life as her status in the UK was uncertain. She was unable to work or claim any public funds and had to survive on the basis of very little support provided by the asylum system and relying on assistance from friends and family, which undermined her self-esteem and caused her embarrassment. She relied on particulars, first of all, relating to her son’s claim, which she said was in all material respects identical to hers (a submission I did not accept). Then that her claim was not considered within a reasonable period of time, which meant there was delay in determining her refugee status”
The Recorder was asked for and allowed further submissions on the correct approach for the Court to take on the issues relating to her asserted Art.8 breaches and delay. The Defendant submitted that if she found a breach she was not tied to the pleaded unreasonable delay start date (1.6.2018) and could decide the right date herself. She accepted that submission. She refused the Defendant’s application for permission to call more evidence (the evidence had been completed). At para. 55 the Recorder found that Art.8 was engaged by the restrictions put on the Claimant’s private life. She could not travel, she could not move freely, she could not develop her private life, she could not work or earn at all and could not claim public benefits or funds and had only asylum support as income. She felt like a criminal. The Recorder then, in paras. 56-58, considered the second part of the Art.8 test: whether the restrictions were lawful, necessary and proportionate. She took into account the Defendant’s policy which required claims to be resolved quickly and the Claimant’s circumstances. In particular the Recorder noted that the Defendant called no evidence, so wholly failed to discharge the burden of proof which it carried, to show that the restrictions to the Claimant’s Art.8 rights were lawful, necessary and proportionate.
The Grounds of Appeal
The Appellant did not number each ground of appeal.  Instead, the Appellant gave 6 numbered grounds and put lots of different sub-grounds inside each.
Ground 1 (G1): The first part of this ground was the assertion that the Recorder made an error in law by ruling that the initial detention was unlawful. The Appellant’s submission was that the Recorder relied on the Claimant’s 2015 and 2017 submissions when making her decision.  I reject that because it is plain from what the Recorder said in para. 44 that she did not. The second submission was that the Recorder misdirected herself by treating the risk of absconding as constant instead of considering all the relevant circumstances objectively. There is no such suggestion in the judgment so I reject that sub-ground. What the Recorder decided was that the Appellant changed their assessment of the risk of absconding three times and did not explain why each time.  It was next submitted that there were no or no viable alternatives to detention after the RDs were served because the Claimant had refused voluntary removal and the Recorder had failed to understand the purpose, which was to get the Claimant to the airport.  This could be called the “Automatic Detention” submission. The Appellant relied on the judgment of Thomas LCJ in Fardous v SSHD [2015] EWHC Civ. 931, at paras. 44 and 45:
“The risk of absconding
It is self-evident that the risk of absconding is of critical and paramount importance in the assessment of the lawfulness of the detention. That is because if a person absconds it will defeat the primary purpose for which Parliament conferred the power to detain and for which the detention order was made in the particular case. This has been made clear in a number of cases: see for example paragraph 54 of the judgment of Keene LJ in R (A) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2007] EWCA Civ 804 and the judgment of Lord Dyson in Lumba at paragraph 121.
Although the risk of absconding will therefore always be of paramount importance, a very careful assessment of that risk must be made in each case, as the magnitude of that risk will vary according to the circumstances. It may be very great, for example, where the person has, as in this case, a clear track record of dishonesty and a knowledge of how to “work” the controls imposed to regulate immigration in the European Union. Another example where the risk may be high is where the person refuses voluntary repatriation that is immediately available to him. It is important to emphasise that the risk of absconding is distinct from the risk of committing further offences and not dependent on that further risk. The risk of re-offending requires its own distinct assessment.”
Finally, the Appellant asserted that the lack of signatures on the key forms was minor and was inadequate to found unlawfulness.
The Respondent submitted firstly, that the Recorder did not base her decision on the 2015 or 2017 submissions, which I accept is correct from an objective reading of the judgment. Secondly, the Respondent submitted that the Appellant had not addressed the reasons given by the Recorder for the unlawfulness of the detention. The appeal skeleton only addressed the assessment of the risk of absconding and ignored the failure to consider alternative methods of ensuring compliance with RDs. This partly fell away during submissions because the Appellant did address more reasons in her verbal submissions.  Thirdly, the Respondent pointed out that the Recorder was entitled to find that the Appellant had failed to consider reasonable alternatives to detention because no evidence was called by the Appellant and the forms and GCID notes were empty of explanation, where such should be set out.
The Policy relevant to G1 – unlawful detention – breach of policy
The 2018 Home Office Detention Policy, Chapter 55 was in evidence at trial and before me.  The relevant parts were as follows (all italics are my highlighting, the bold was in the text):
General
The power to detain must be retained in the interests of maintaining effective immigration control. However, there is a presumption in favour of immigration bail and, wherever possible, alternatives to detention are used (see 55.20 and chapter 57). Detention is most usually appropriate:
• to effect removal;
• initially to establish a person's identity or basis of claim; or
• where there is reason to believe that the person will fail to comply with any conditions attached to a grant of immigration bail.
To be lawful, detention must not only be based on one of the statutory powers and accord with the limitations implied by domestic and Strasbourg case law but must also accord with stated policy.
…
Use of detention
General
Detention must be used sparingly, and for the shortest period necessary. It is not an effective use of detention space to detain people for lengthy periods if it would be practical to effect detention later in the process, for example once any rights of appeal have been exhausted if that is likely to be protracted and/or there are no other factors present arguing more strongly in favour of detention. All other things being equal, a person who has an appeal pending or representations outstanding might have relatively more incentive to comply with any restrictions imposed, if released, than one who does not and is imminently removable (see also 55.14).
…
Implied Limitations on the Statutory Powers to Detain
In order to be lawful, immigration detention must be for one of the statutory purposes for which the power is given and must accord with the limitations implied by domestic and ECHR case law. Detention must also be in accordance with stated policy on the use of detention.
…
55.1.4.2 Article 8 of the ECHR
Article 8(1) of the ECHR provides:
“Everyone has the right to respect for private and family life….”
Article 8 is a qualified right. Interference with the right to family life is permissible under Article 8(2) if it is (i) in accordance with the law; (ii) for a legitimate aim and (iii) proportionate. In family cases, the right extends to every member of the household and there should be consideration given to whether there is any interference with the rights of each individual and, if there is, whether it is lawful and proportionate to the legitimate aim. It may be necessary on occasion to detain the head of the household or another adult who is part of the care arrangements for children, thus separating a family. Depending on the circumstances of the case, this may represent an interference with Article 8 rights.
It is well established that the interests of the State in maintaining an effective immigration policy for the economic well-being of the country and for the prevention of crime and disorder, justifies interference with rights under Article 8(1). It is therefore arguable that a decision to detain which interferes with a person’s right to family life in order to enforce immigration control and maintain an effective immigration policy pursues a legitimate aim and is in accordance with the law. It is only by considering the needs and circumstances of each family member that a determination can be made as to whether the decision is, or can be managed in a way so that it is, proportionate. Home Office staff should be clear and careful when deciding that the decision to detain (and thereby interfere with family life) was proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued. Assessing whether the interference is proportionate involves balancing the legitimate aim in Article 8(2) against the seriousness of the interference with the person’s right to respect for their family life.
…
Power to detain
…
""If there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that a person is someone in respect of whom directions may be given under any of paragraphs 8 to 10 or 12 to 14, that person may be detained under the authority of an immigration officer pending a) a decision whether or not to give such directions; b) his removal in pursuance of such directions"".
…
Detention can only lawfully be exercised under these provisions where there is a realistic prospect of removal within a reasonable period. The decision to detain may have been taken under circumstances where an individual claimed to have a family life in the UK but there was no information reasonably available to allow independent verification or consideration. In such cases, information must be gathered as soon as possible and consideration given at the initial and subsequent detention reviews. In cases where a family life in the UK is known to be subsisting and detention will result in the family being separated, the separation must be authorised by an assistant director on the basis of a written consideration of the welfare of any children involved.
…
Decision to detain (excluding criminal casework cases)
There is a presumption in favour of granting immigration bail - there must be strong grounds for believing that a person will not comply with conditions of immigration bail for detention to be justified.
All reasonable alternatives to detention must be considered before detention is authorised.
Each case must be considered on its individual merits, including consideration of the duty to have regard to the need to safeguard and promote the welfare of any children involved.
…
Factors influencing a decision to detain
All relevant factors must be taken into account when considering the need for initial or continued detention, including:
• What is the likelihood of the person being removed and, if so, after what timescale?
• Is there any evidence of previous absconding?
• Is there any evidence of a previous failure to comply with conditions of immigration bail (or, formerly, temporary admission or release)?
• Has the subject taken part in a determined attempt to breach the immigration laws? (For example, entry in breach of a deportation order, attempted or actual clandestine entry).
• Is there a previous history of complying with the requirements of immigration control? (For example, by applying for a visa or further leave).
• What are the person's ties with the UK? Are there close relatives (including dependants) here? Does anyone rely on the person for support? If the dependant is a child or vulnerable adult, do they depend heavily on public welfare services for their daily care needs in lieu of support from the detainee? Does the person have a settled address/employment?
• What are the individual's expectations about the outcome of the case? Are there factors such as an outstanding appeal, an application for judicial review or representations which might afford more incentive to keep in touch than if such factors were not present? (See also 55.14).
…
Once detention has been authorised, it must be kept under close review to ensure that it continues to be justified.
…
Detention forms
Written reasons for detention should be given in all cases at the time of detention and thereafter at monthly intervals (in this context, every 28 days). Recognising that most people are detained for just a few hours or days, initial reasons should be given by way of a checklist similar to that used for bail in a magistrate’s court. The forms IS 91RA 'Risk Assessment' (see 55.6.1), IS91 'Detention Authority' (see 55.6.2), IS91R 'Reasons for detention' (see 55.6.3) and IS91M 'Movement notification' (see 55.6.4) replace all of the following forms.
…
Once detention space is required the IS91RA must be faxed to the detainee escorting and population management unit (DEPMU). DEPMU staff will assess risk based upon the information provided on the IS91RA part A and decide on the detention location appropriate for someone presenting those risks and/or needs. The issue of an IS91 'Detention Authority' will be authorised with the identified risks recorded in the 'risk factors' section of this form.
…
Form IS91 Authority to detain
Once DEPMU has decided on detention location they will forward an IS91RA part B to the detaining office detailing the detention location and the assessment of risk. This must be attached to form IS91 and served by the IO or person acting on behalf of the Secretary of State on the detaining agent. This allows for the subject to be detained in the detaining agent’s custody under Immigration Act powers. The IO or person acting on behalf of the Secretary of State must complete the first three sections of the form, transferring the assessment of risk as notified by DEPMU onto section 3, complete the first entry of section 4 transfer record and sign and date the form on page 1.
…
Detaining agents have been instructed not to accept detainees without the correct documentation. The only exception to this will be when there is no Home Office presence at a police station or prison. In these circumstances, a copy of the IS91, complete with photograph, will need to be faxed or emailed. In such cases, DEPMU will advise as to where the original IS91 should be sent.
…
Form IS91R Reasons for detention
…
It should be noted that the reasons for detention given could be subject to judicial review. It is therefore important to ensure they are always justified and correctly stated by the IO or person acting on behalf of the Secretary of State who is completing the form. A copy of the form (fully completed and signed on both sides) must be retained on the caseworking file. If any of the reasons for detention given on the form IS91R change it will be necessary to prepare and serve a new version of the form. Again, any such changes must be fully justified and correctly stated by the IO or person acting on behalf of the Secretary of State who is completing the form. It is important that the detainee understands the contents of the IS91R. If he does not understand English, officers should ensure that the form’s contents are interpreted. Failure to do so could lead to successful challenge under the Human Rights Act (Article 5(2) of the ECHR refers).
The five possible reasons for detention are set out on form IS91R and are listed below. The IO or person acting on behalf of the Secretary of State must tick all the reasons that apply to the particular case and, as indicated above, ensure that a fully justified explanation is retained on file setting out why the reasons ticked apply in the particular case:
• You are likely to abscond if granted immigration bail.
• There is insufficient reliable information to decide on whether to grant you immigration bail.
• Your removal from the UK is imminent.
• You need to be detained whilst alternative arrangements are made for your care.
• Your release is not considered conducive to the public good.
…
Detention procedures
Procedures when detaining an illegal entrant or person served with
notice of administrative removal
• Obtain the appropriate authority to detain;
• issue BAIL 403 (Immigration Bail Information) and advise the person of his right to apply for bail;
• conduct 'risk assessment' procedures as detailed in paragraph 55.6.1
• complete IS91 in full for the detaining authority;
• complete and serve form IS91R on the person being detained, explaining its contents to the person (via an interpreter if necessary);
• confirm detention to DEPMU as soon as possible and they will allocate a reference number;
• complete IS93 for the port/ immigration compliance and enforcement (ICE) team casework file;
• always attach a 'detained' flag, securely stapled, to the port/ICE team casework file;
• review detention as appropriate.”
The Appellant relied on para. 55.3.2 which related to criminal casework and was not in my judgment relevant.
I note that in the Trial Bundle and in the Appeal Bundle was a statement by the Home Secretary dated 24.7.2018 which included the following words:
“… 95% of people liable for removal at any one time are not in detention at all, but carefully risk assessed and managed in the community instead.” (My italics).
The Law relevant to G1 – unlawful detention
The leading authority on unlawful detention is R (Lumba & Mighty) v SSHD [2011] UKSC 12. The facts related to the deportation of foreign born individuals who had committed crimes in England and were detained pending deportation. Lumba was imprisoned for a crime, then detained pending deportation and then left voluntarily 5 years later.  Davis J. found the Appellant was operating an unlawful policy of detention. On appeal the relevant issue related to whether “but for the unlawful detention” the Claimant would have been detained in any event and hence whether only nominal damages would be awarded. Lord Dyson (who gave the judgment of all in the Supreme Court), held at para. 64, that not all breaches of policy made detention unlawful. In civil claims for damages for UD the cause of action is complete on intentional imprisonment without proof of damage (paras. 64-65) and once the Claimant raised intentional imprisonment the burden shifted to the Appellant to prove that it was lawful:
“[65] …  All that a claimant has to prove in order to establish false imprisonment is that he was directly and intentionally imprisoned by the defendant, whereupon the burden shifts to the defendant to show that there was lawful justification for doing so. As Lord Bridge of Harwich said in Hague v Deputy Governor of Parkhurst Prison, Weldon v Home Office [1991] 3 All ER 733 at 743, [1992] 1 AC 58 at 162: ‘The tort of false imprisonment has two ingredients: the fact of imprisonment and the absence of lawful authority to justify it.’”
Lord Dyson went on to rule that the Appellant had to show that the detention was lawful:
“[88] To summarise, therefore, in cases such as these, all that the claimant has to do is to prove that he was detained. The Secretary of State must prove that the detention was justified in law. She cannot do this by showing that, although the decision to detain was tainted by public law error in the sense that I have described, a decision to detain free from error could and would have been made.”
Lord Dyson then considered the claim for UD and the evidence of breach of policy and ruled thus:
“OVERALL CONCLUSION ON LIABILITY ON THE BASIS THAT THE POLICIES APPLIED WERE UNLAWFUL
[89] I conclude, therefore, that since it is common ground that the unlawful policies in force between April 2006 and September 2008 were applied to Mr Lumba and Mr Mighty, they were unlawfully detained and their claims in false imprisonment must succeed. I turn to consider the assessment of damages.
COMPENSATORY OR NOMINAL DAMAGES?
[90] Having found that there was no liability in false imprisonment, the Court of Appeal did not need to decide whether the claimants were entitled to damages. They did, however, say ([2010] 4 All ER 489 at [96], [2010] 1 WLR 2168):
‘If, on the evidence, it was clear that, even assuming a lawful consideration, there was no realistic possibility of a different decision having been reached, and no realistic possibility of earlier release, then we do not see why that should not be reflected in an award of nominal damages only.’”
Dealing with the issue of causation, Lord Dyson ruled that this was to be decided by determining what would have occurred but for the unlawful detention:
“[93] I do not consider that this case was correctly decided on the issue of damages. I agree that the plaintiff was entitled to be put into the position in which he would have been if the tort of false imprisonment had not been committed. But I do not agree that, if the tort had not been committed, the plaintiff would not have been detained between 5.25 am and 7.45 am. On the judge’s findings, if the tort had not been committed, he would have been detained during this period. It seems to me that the fallacy in the analysis in Roberts’s case is that it draws no distinction between a detainee who would have remained in detention if the review had been carried out (and therefore no tort committed) and a detainee who would not have remained in detention if the review had been carried out. But the position of the two detainees is fundamentally different. The first has suffered no loss because he would have remained in detention whether the tort was committed or not. The second has suffered real loss because, if the tort had not been committed, he would not have remained in detention.
…
[95] The question here is simply whether, on the hypothesis under consideration, the victims of the false imprisonment have suffered any loss which should be compensated in more than nominal damages. Exemplary damages apart, the purpose of damages is to compensate the victims of civil wrongs for the loss and damage that the wrongs have caused. If the power to detain had been exercised by the application of lawful policies, and on the assumption that the Ex p Singh principles had been properly applied (an issue which I discuss at [129]–[148], below), it is inevitable that the appellants would have been detained. In short, they suffered no loss or damage as a result of the unlawful exercise of the power to detain. They should receive no more than nominal damages.”
So, I glean from this ruling that if the breach/es of policy by the Appellant is/are sufficiently serious to make the detention unlawful, causation is not relevant to liability but is relevant to the assessment of quantum.  A “but for” analysis is needed of whether the Claimant would in any event have been detained if the Appellant had applied the policy properly. In R (Abdollahi) v SSHD [2013] EWCA Civ. 366, Moses LJ, at para. 35, ruled that the but for test is to be decided on the balance of probabilities.
Further authority for the principle that UD follows when the decision to detain was taken in breach of policy in a criminal deportation case was set out in Fardous v SSHD [2015] EWCA Civ. 931, in which Thomas LCJ summarised the approach thus:
The power of the Secretary of State to detain pending removal is set out in paragraph 16(2) of Schedule 2 to the Immigration Act 1971. That power must be exercised on the basis of the well-known Hardial Singh principles as reformulated in R(I) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2003] INLR 196 at paragraph 46 and accepted as correct in the judgment of Lord Dyson JSC in Lumba as follows:
The Secretary of State must intend to deport the person and can only use the power to detain for that purpose.
The deportee may only be detained for a period that is reasonable in all the circumstances.
If before the expiry of the reasonable period it becomes apparent that the Secretary of State will not be able to effect deportation within a reasonable period, he should not seek to exercise the power of detention.
The Secretary of State should act with reasonable diligence and expedition to effect removal.”
In relation to the risk of criminals absconding he ruled thus:
“The risk of absconding
It is self-evident that the risk of absconding is of critical and paramount importance in the assessment of the lawfulness of the detention. That is because if a person absconds it will defeat the primary purpose for which Parliament conferred the power to detain and for which the detention order was made in the particular case. This has been made clear in a number of cases: see for example paragraph 54 of the judgment of Keene LJ in R (A) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2007] EWCA Civ. 804 and the judgment of Lord Dyson in Lumba at paragraph 121. 45. Although the risk of absconding will therefore always be of paramount importance, a very careful assessment of that risk must be made in each case, as the magnitude of that risk will vary according to the circumstances. It may be very great, for example, where the person has, as in this case, a clear track record of dishonesty and a knowledge of how to “work” the controls imposed to regulate immigration in the European Union. Another example where the risk may be high is where the person refuses voluntary repatriation that is immediately available to him. It is important to emphasise that the risk of absconding is distinct from the risk of committing further offences and not dependent on that further risk. The risk of re-offending requires its own distinct assessment.”
I consider that these principles apply equally to a person who has committed no crimes, but the fact that the Claimant is not a criminal weighs in her favour. So, in the appeal before me, the risk of this Claimant absconding had to be analysed by the Appellant in the context of her circumstances. Refusal of voluntary removal is relevant and weighs in favour of detention but is not decisive.  In an earlier case, upon which the Respondent relied, E v Home Office [2010] (unreported, 9CL01651) HHJ Collins, sitting at Central London County Court, ruled that when considering the reasons given by the defendant the exercise the Courts carry out is not a pure review on judicial review grounds but a re-analysis by the Court. At para. 3 he ruled as follows:
A question arises as to the role of the Court in relation to these decisions. The judgment of Mr Justice Wyn Williams in S C & D v The Secretary of State for the Home Department, in which judgment was handed down on the 2007-July-18, referred to a division of opinion in the High Court as to the role of the judge. A few days later, on the 2007-July-30, the Court of Appeal handed down judgment in the case of A v The Secretary of State for the Home Department, being aware of an earlier judgment by Mr Justice Field which had been followed by Mr Justice Wyn Williams but not being aware of the decision of Mr Justice Wyn Williams himself, in which the division of opinion appears to have been resolved in a way which is currently binding on me in favour of the proposition that, with the liberty of the subject being involved, it is not sufficient for the court simply to consider whether or not the decision-maker’s decision was reasonable according to Wednesbury standards but that the court should act as a primary decision-maker itself. Mr Poole, on behalf of the Secretary of State, has not argued to the contrary.”
That approach appears to be consonant with the later judgment of Lord Dyson in Lumba who said at para. 54:
“[54] Secondly, it is for the Secretary of State to satisfy the court that it is right to infer from the refusal by a detained person of an offer of voluntary repatriation that, if released, he will abscond. There will no doubt be many cases where the court will be persuaded to draw such an inference. I am not, however, satisfied that this is such a case. It is not at all surprising that this appellant has refused voluntary repatriation. He has not yet exhausted the asylum process, which, if successful, would permit him to remain in the UK. In these circumstances, why should one infer from the refusal of voluntary repatriation that, if released, he would abscond? In my judgment, the most that can be said is that there is a risk that if he is released the appellant will abscond. But that can be said of most cases. I do not consider that the fact that he has refused the offer of voluntary repatriation adds materially to the evidence that such risk is present in the instance case.”
Examples of cases where the Courts have found UD arose were put before me. So, In Muuse v SSHD [2010] EWCA Civ. 453, the Court of Appeal upheld an award of damages for UD involving, amongst other failures, a failure to sign the IS91 and a failure to fill in the grounds for detention.  In Maarouf v SSHD [2020] (unreported, EOOCL2216) HHJ Lochrane assessed damages for UD, having found unlawful detention beyond the period admitted by the defendant, for breaches of policy including disregarding the claimant’s past conduct which weighed in his favour and the defendant’s failure to call any evidence that the detention had been properly authorised at a senior level as required by policy.
Analysis and conclusions on G1
G1: Liability
The Recorder extracted various clear requirements from the Appellant’s policy. I have highlighted the ones which are relevant in italics above. She then made 4 core findings of fact relating to breaches by the Appellant of the policy requirements when the initial decision to detain was made. Those were: a failure to carry out the necessary consideration of alternatives to detention; a failure to carry out an adequate or explained assessment of the Claimant’s risk of absconding; a failure to evidence that a senior officer had authorised the detention and a failure to keep policy compliant records.  In my judgment, contrary to the Appellant’s automatic detention submission, where the Appellant issues RDs to an individual the presumption in favour of liberty still applies and detention for the purposes of removal still has to be justified by the Appellant as necessary and proportionate to achieve a valid aim. The Appellant is required to consider alternatives to detention. So in this case various alternatives were put forwards in submissions: tagging, curfew, increased reporting (so, for instance, 2 days before the flight on 17.4.2018). None of these was considered.   The Appellant had to assess the risk of the Claimant absconding, taking into account all of the Claimant’s circumstances.  The listed factors in the policy included the Claimant’s previous reporting compliance and her compliance with conditions imposed (factors wholly in the Claimant’s favour over many years); evidence of previous absconding (a factor wholly in the Claimant’s favour); her family ties in the UK (a factor in her favour because her son had just been given refugee status and lived with her); the likelihood of removal (a factor against the Claimant, because it was imminent, but potentially modified by her 2015/2017 submissions had the Appellant read her Home Office file); any determined attempts to breach immigration laws (the Claimant had applied many times for leave to stay and had an outstanding potential submission from 2015/2017 but had made no such attempts); the Claimant’s expectations (this factor should have been in her favour, she had just received her son’s asylum success and had given evidence, which the Appellant did not challenge, so this factor was in her favour and she had put submissions in during 2015 and 2017 which were unanswered). The Appellant was required by the policy to keep policy compliant records and failed to do so. The IS91 and IS91R had blanks on key factors and decisions. Finally, the IS91 and IS91R were not signed by the senior officer required to review or make the decisions.
The only reason for initial detention given by the Appellant on the forms and in the GCID was, as the Recorder found, the risk of absconding, presumably due to the proposed, and later the served, RDs. However, that risk was assessed at contradictory levels.  Despite the fact that the Appellant knew that it would soon serve RDs it was written as “low” on 2.4.2018 and rose to “high” on 9.4.2018 with no explanation and then fell to “medium” whilst she was still in detention.  The Recorder found that these figures were illogical without explanation. There was no explanation in the GCID notes or on the IS91 forms.  The Appellant put forwards no evidence that “all the Claimant’s circumstances” were considered and weighed when reaching these determinations. These failures were contrary to the express policy. Worse, so the Recorder found, no alternatives to detention were noted or considered by the Appellant, which was again contrary to the policy. I reject the submission by the Appellant that there were no potentially reasonable alternatives.  The Recorder found that there were alternatives to consider and that there was no evidence put before her by the Appellant on the issue. The Appellant’s submissions in the appeal that there were no realistic the alternatives were therefore unsupported by any evidence. It is not the Appellant’s written and stated policy that detention follows automatically when the Appellant serves RDs on an individual who has never been convicted of any offence, has fully complied with immigration conditions and reporting restrictions and has family in England. Nor, in my judgment, does the individual’s refusal to leave voluntarily cause automatic detention.  The decision to detain is an evaluative one, the policy must be applied and factors must be weighed.  It was telling that the only paragraph from the policy relied upon by the Appellant for the submission that detention was inevitable or automatic after serving RDs related to convicted criminals and even then the paragraph was qualified as follows:
“Application of the factors in 55.3.1 to criminal casework cases
Imminence
55.3.2.4 In all cases, caseworkers should consider on an individual basis whether removal is imminent. If removal is imminent, then detention or continued detention will usually be appropriate. As a guide, and for these purposes only, removal could be said to be imminent where a travel document exists, removal directions are set, there are no outstanding legal barriers and removal is likely to take place in the next four weeks.” (My italics).
In my judgment the Recorder’s rulings on unlawful detention due to breaches of policy were logical, supported by the evidence and her unchallenged findings of fact. These breaches were not trivial or minor.  Proper risk assessment has been described by the higher appellate Courts as very important and paramount. Likewise, consideration of alternatives to detention, the need for proper records and the need for senior sign off where the liberty of the individual is being taken away. All of these are not frivolous or minor matters. The same reasoning applies to the decisions to continue detention on review.  As I stated above, on the appeal, the Appellant never engaged with the Recorder’s findings relating to continued detention after the RDs were cancelled.  For these reasons I dismiss the liability parts of Ground 1 of the appeal.
G1: Causation, quantum and nominal damages
G1 contained a separate set of grounds relating to causation at paras. 6.3 – 6.7. The Appellant submitted that the Recorder failed to apply the law arising from Lumba and the causation test when assessing damages.  This was dressed up as a liability point but is not. It is a quantum point. The Appellant relied on O [2014] EWCA Civ. 909, and judgment of Richards LJ in OM (Nigeria) [2012] EWCA Civ. 597. Neither of these cases was in the authorities bundles. Instead, counsel for the Appellant extracted paras. 19-24 of the judgment of Richards LJ in OM into her skeleton.  That is an unsatisfactory way forwards but, in any event, all that was said in that ruling is that the balance of probabilities is the correct standard of proof for the but for test of causation relating to whether the Appellant would have detained the Claimant in any event had the policy been properly applied and followed. In OM Richards LJ was satisfied that, but for the policy breaches, the defendant would have detained the claimant in any event, inter alia  because later that is exactly what happened. The result was that only nominal damages were appropriate for the unlawful detention.
The Appellant submitted that the Recorder failed to consider this but for test at all.  Furthermore, had she done so, the inevitable result would have been a finding that, but for the breaches or policy, the Appellant would in any event had detained the Claimant. The Respondent submitted that this ground was a difficult one for the Appellant to make out taking into account that the point was not pleaded in the defence and was not raised in submissions by the Appellant at trial.  Furthermore, the Appellant did not put in any evidence about what decision would have been made if policy had been properly followed, despite carrying the burden of proof to do so (see para. 23 of the judgment of Richards LJ in OM). In submissions in the appeal some discussion arose over what would have occurred had the Claimant been served with the RDs and allowed to go home instead of being detained.  It seems likely to me, on balance, that she would have contacted her direct access barrister immediately (as she did on the facts, when she was in detention). The barrister would then have put in submissions (as he did on 11, 12 and 13 April 2018) and it is likely that the Appellant would have considered those to constitute a fresh claim (as in the event they did on 16.4.2018).  That would have led to the RDs being withdrawn (as they were) and so no detention decision would ever have been made. Thus, I reject the Appellant’s submissions on causation both in logic and because the Appellant failed to discharge the burden of proof at trial. The submissions in this part of G1 were based on a complete lack of evidence that the Appellant would have detained the Claimant in any event if policy had been followed and do not stand up to logical scrutiny.
G2: Basic damages
Ground 2 contained an acceptance that the basic award of damages for unlawful detention was correct.  At trial the Appellant had submitted that the appropriate award was £17,526,60. The Recorder awarded £18,000.
G2: Aggravated damages
In G2 the Appellant submitted that there was no legal or evidential basis for aggravated damages so the award of £12,000 was wrong. Additional damage had to be shown by the Claimant over and above that covered by the normal compensatory award. The Appellant asserted that no such evidence was provided and the Recorder made no such findings. Reliance was placed on Diop [2018] EWHC 3420, in which a violent man who had been in prison for 2 years was unlawfully detained in immigration detention for 27 days.  There was no “initial shock” from his first detention, he had been imprisoned for long periods before. The award was £9,000 plus interest and no aggravated damages were awarded because John Howell QC, sitting as a deputy, considered that the basic award would adequately cover his suffering. Those facts are very different to the Claimant’s circumstances and her fears. Awards of aggravated damages are very fact sensitive balancing the abuse alongside the UD with the Claimant’s circumstances, vulnerabilities, personality and experiences.
The Recorder’s quantum awards were made at a second hearing and the judgment, dated 23.12.2022, and contained the following findings relating to aggravated damages.
“Aggravated damages
The next item I considered was aggravated damages. The defendant conceded that there should be an award of aggravated damages based on my findings on liability and contended for a figure of £5,000.”
In the light of this concession I do not consider that the Appellant can properly raise this ground of appeal. These proceedings are civil litigation. If a party makes a concession on an issue before the trial judge that party cannot later complain on appeal that the trial judge relied on that concession, unless the concession was triggered by misrepresentation or fraud. It was the responsibility of counsel and the solicitor at trial only to make concessions which were legally correct and only on instructions.  If the concession was not legally correct (I pass no comment) that is a matter between the Appellant and it’s lawyers.  In the appeal the Appellant challenged this concession but directed me to no part of the transcript to support the challenge.
As to the quantum of the award for aggravated damages, in G2 the Appellant asserted that £12,000 was wrong because it was too high, being two thirds of the award for basic damages. It was submitted that the rule of thumb is no more than one half.  No authority was provided in support of that submission.  The Respondent submitted that the Recorder provided extensive reasons for the award and considered comparable awards and so the award was unchallengeable.
In Thompson v Commissioner of Police [1998] Q.B. 498, the Court of Appeal gave guidance on such awards. C1 having been lawfully arrested, was manhandled and assaulted by police officers and wrongly detained in a cell at the police station for a period of four hours. She claimed damages against the defendant for false imprisonment and malicious prosecution, they had fabricated a criminal case against her but she was acquitted at trial.  In the civil case the jury awarded her damages, including aggravated damages, in the sum of £1,500, and exemplary damages in the sum of £50,000. C2 was unlawfully arrested, assaulted and abused by a number of police officers who subsequently wrongly detained him in a police cell for an hour and a quarter. He suffered physical and psychological injury (depression and PTSD). He claimed damages against the defendant for wrongful arrest, false imprisonment and assault. The jury awarded him damages, including aggravated damages, in the sum of £20,000 and made an award of £200,000 by way of exemplary damages. On appeal, the basic award to C1 was increased to £10,000; the award for aggravated damages was increased to £25,000 and the exemplary damages award was reduced to £25,000. For C2, the award of exemplary damages was reduced to £15,000. Lord Woolf MR gave the lead judgment. Taking into account the short periods of false imprisonment and the level of personal injury, these awards can be seen as substantial in 1996. Inflation since then, over 28 years, has increased their current day value by a factor of 252%. At P512 Lord Woolf ruled thus:
“It is when the jury have to consider whether there should be an award of aggravated damages as additional compensation that the award in this class of case is more analogous to that in defamation proceedings. As the Law Commission point out in their admirable consultative paper Aggravated, Exemplary and Restitutionary Damages (1993) (Consultation Paper No. 132) para. 2.17 et seq. there can be a penal element in the award of aggravated damages. However, they are primarily to be awarded to compensate the plaintiff for injury to his proper pride and dignity and the consequences of his being humiliated. This injury which is made worse for the plaintiff because it is more difficult to excuse when the malicious motives, spite or arrogance on the part of the police: see Rookes v. Barnard [1964] A.C. 1129, 1221 et seq., per Lord Devlin. It is when the jury make an award of exemplary damages that the similarity of this class of action with defamation is closest. However, a factor justifying the award of exemplary damages which in defamation actions makes consistency in the proper amount to award less likely is that often the award is to prevent a newspaper profiting from the libel by increasing its circulation. This element of profiting from your tort is almost invariably absent from this class of action. In addition, as the defendant is usually a chief officer of police, the personality of the defendant will not usually be significant in determining what the appropriate level of punitive damages should be. While the conduct calling for the award of exemplary damages may differ it is to be hoped that it will be rare indeed for the most senior officers in the force to be in any way implicated. The fact that the defendant is a chief officer of police also means that here exemplary damages should have a lesser role to play.”
Then at P513A:
“There is also a greater problem of awarding exemplary as well as aggravated damages in the class of action under consideration because the very circumstances which will justify the award of aggravated damages are probably the same as those which make it possible to award exemplary damages. This accentuates the risk of a double counting. At least in defamation proceedings there is the additional factor of the defendant profiting from the libel which provides the independent justification for the award of exemplary damages.”
Then at P514 F
It should be explained to the jury that if they find in the plaintiff's favour the only remedy which they have power to grant is an award of damages. Save in exceptional situations such damages are only awarded as compensation and are intended to compensate the plaintiff for any injury or damage which he has suffered. They are not intended to punish the defendant.
As the law stands at present compensatory damages are of two types, (a) Ordinary damages which we would suggest should be described as basic, and (b) aggravated damages. Aggravated damages can only be awarded where they are claimed by the plaintiff and where there are aggravating features about the defendant's conduct which justify the award "" of aggravated damages. (We would add that in the rare case where special damages are claimed in respect of some specific pecuniary loss this claim should be explained separately.)”
Further at P515D
In a straightforward case of wrongful arrest and imprisonment the starting point is likely to be about £500 for the first hour during which the plaintiff has been deprived of his or her liberty. After the first hour an additional sum is to be awarded, but that sum should be on a reducing scale so as to keep the damages proportionate with those payable in personal injury cases and because the plaintiff is entitled to have a higher rate of compensation for the initial shock of being arrested. As a guideline we consider, for example, that a plaintiff who has been wrongly kept in custody for 24 hours should for this alone normally be regarded as entitled to an award of about £3,000. For subsequent days the daily rate will be on a progressively reducing scale.
Further at P516 C:
“Such damages can be awarded where there are aggravating features about the case which would result in the plaintiff not receiving sufficient compensation for the injury suffered if the award were restricted to a basic award. Aggravating features can include humiliating circumstances at the time of arrest or any conduct of those responsible for the arrest or the prosecution which shows that they had behaved in a high handed, insulting, malicious or oppressive manner either in relation to the arrest or imprisonment or in conducting the prosecution. Aggravating features can also include the way the litigation and trial are conducted.”
So, in Thompson, C1’s aggravated damages award was higher than the basic award and the exemplary damages were the same as the aggravated damages. In paras. 11 to 23 the Recorder carefully considered three other comparable awards: E v Home Office; Maarouf  and Santos and made an award of £12,000 for aggravated damages. I further take into account that in R (on the application of MK (Algeria)) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2010] EWCA Civ. 980, a lower award for aggravated damages was made at £5,000 against the background of a basic award increased by the Court of Appeal to £12,500 for 24 days of unlawful detention.  Those awards were made 14 years ago. I take into account that in Muuse v SSHD [2010] EWCA Civ. 453, the claimant was unlawfully imprisoned for 4 months and was awarded £20,000 for his basic damages and £7,500 for aggravated damages. In E v SSHD [2010] (cited above) the claimant was unlawfully detained for a month.  She was awarded £22,500 made up of £12,500 for unlawful detention and £10,000 for her psychiatric injury (she has been raped in prison abroad and was traumatised by the detention here).  The award for aggravated damages was £10,000, which was more than half of the award for unlawful detention (excluding the psychiatric injury).  In Maarouf v SSHD [2020] (cited above) the claimant was awarded £25,000 damages for the basic award and £5,000 for aggravated damages.   I note that some of the aggravated damages awards in these cases were less than half of the basic award but some were much higher. In my judgment these cases are acutely fact sensitive, focussing on the claimant and his or her vulnerabilities. It is of course always vital to avoid double counting and overlap.  The Recorder heard the Claimant’s evidence and accepted it. The Appellant called no evidence. I do not consider that the award for aggravated damages was so out of the reasonable scale or the guidelines set by the Court of Appeal that it can be declared wrong.  Nor do I accept there is any substance to the asserted “rule of thumb”.
G2: Exemplary damages
The Appellant submitted that the award of £12,000 for exemplary damages for her UD was wrong in law because such awards are only made where the facts expose an abuse of power which was outrageous, extraordinary and required censure. It was submitted that few awards are made, thus none was made in Lumba but the Appellant accepted that Muuse was an example where one was made. It was submitted that exemplary damages are not awarded for negligence or maladministration.
The Appellant relied in the skeleton argument on the judgment of a Lord Justice of appeal (unnamed) in Home Office v Mohammad [2020] EWCA Civ. 351 at paras. 15 and 24.  This authority was not in the authorities bundle. I should mention here that it causes a disadvantage to the other party when the Appellant fails to put an authority relied upon in a skeleton into the authorities bundle and inconveniences the Judge, who then has to find the case. I did so. The facts were that the claimants pleaded claims under four separate heads: breach of statutory duty, negligence, breach of article 5 of the ECHR and breach of article 8. As pleaded, the damage under the last head was simply described as “reducing [the claimant’s] ability to develop family and private life ties in the United Kingdom”, together with unparticularised special damages for loss of earnings and benefits. Only the negligence and Art.8 claims survived a striking out application.  The SSHD appealed the refusal to strike out the woke claim.  The Court of Appeal held that no claim arises in negligence but permitted the Art.8 claims to continue.  Paras. 15 and 24, which the Appellant relied upon, related to the allowed part of the appeal.  These paragraphs do not relate to exemplary damages so were not relevant to this ground. The Appellant also relied on AA (Afghanistan) [2012] EWCA Civ. 1383, but the submissions arising from that judgment did not impinge on exemplary damages or support the ground either. The Appellant then made submissions in the skeleton about the Recorder’s decision to award exemplary damages using words such as “lack of balance and objectivity” and describing the award as “entirely unjustified by adequate reasoning”.
The Respondent submitted that the Recorder noted that the legal principles for deciding the threshold for an award of exemplary damages were not in dispute at trial and laid the principles out in the judgment.  Thus, the only ground of appeal which could be raised would focus on whether the facts fell within the agreed legal test.  The Respondent submitted that the ruling that exemplary damages were awardable arose from the factual findings and was justified and the assessment of the quantum was within a reasonable range.
The Recorder’s decision on exemplary damages and the reasoning was set out between paras. 25 and 40. She ruled thus:
“Exemplary damages
Exemplary damages are punitive in nature. The claimant claims the figure of £35,000 and the defendant denies that exemplary damages should be paid at all; in the alternative, the defendant says no more than £5,000.
Exemplary damages can be awarded “for oppressive, arbitrary or unconstitutional action by servants of the Government” (Rookes v Barnard). In Muuse v SSHD [2010] EWCA Civ 453 the Court of Appeal endorsed the guidance in earlier cases (such as Kuddus v. Chief Constable of Leicestershire [2001] UKHL 29) that the sort of conduct that was necessary for an award of exemplary damages was conduct that was a “gross misuse of power involving tortuous conduct by agents of the Government” or “outrageous conduct”, such that it called for exemplary damages to mark disapproval, to deter and to vindicate the strength of the
law.
Is there oppressive or arbitrary behaviour by public officers in this case that deserves the exceptional remedy of exemplary damages? Aggravated damages have been awarded here and they have already provided some compensation for the injury caused by the defendant’s oppressive and arbitrary behaviour going beyond ordinary compensatory damages. Is that award by way of compensatory and aggravated damages an inadequate deterrent or punishment for the defendant, taking into account the sum awarded would come from public funds which would have an impact on the funds available to the Home Office? If exemplary damages are to be awarded, they should be no more than sufficient to mark the appropriate disapproval of the oppressive and arbitrary behaviour.
If I am to award exemplary damages, I must also consider, and avoid any overlap between exemplary damages and damages already awarded. With reference to Muuse, the principle is that only if the sum as compensation is inadequate to punish the defendant for their outrageous conduct should the disapproval be marked as such conduct and the defendant deterred from repeating it and then some larger sum can be awarded. The claimant referred to Muuse and the comment about conduct having to be “outrageous”, calling for exemplary damages to mark disapproval. There is no need for this to be qualified by looking for malice, fraud, insolence, cruelty or similar specific conduct.
In the case of Muuse, an award of exemplary damages was made. It was a case in which there were a number of mistakes and a failure to implement clear procedures was described as unforgiveable. It was said that this was an appalling indictment of the way that the Home Office and HMPS were operating in 2006, reflecting an indifference to doing justice on the basis of those who dealt with it.
There was reference to the high handed and oppressive way in which the claimant’s imprisonment in that case was initiated and maintained for such a long time. Mr Muuse was imprisoned, kept in custody, without good cause and inadequate explanation. In that case, his nationality (Dutch) could easily have been confirmed from the outset.”
The Recorder then went on to consider Muuse in more detail and noted the lack of any government recognition that what the SSHD had done in the case before her was wrong and the lack of any inquiry or review of internal procedures to prevent the tortious unlawful detention occurring again in future in similar circumstances. In addition, the only way the wrongdoing had been brought to light was by High Court action. The Recorder also took into account that, despite the Appellant’s file note stating that the Respondent’s Home Office file (of previous claims for asylum/leave to remain) should be read, it never was and the Appellant ignored her fears of oppression in Pakistan expressed by her at initial detention.  The Recorder then ruled as follows:
I concluded that there were multiple failures in the current case. They were not malicious but they are, in my judgment, properly described as “outrageous”. The rights at stake were the most basic rights of liberty of the individual. The claimant feared to return to Pakistan for reasons of her religion and personal safety, which she clearly expressed to the defendant on being detained, and was, indeed, in due course granted refugee status, thus vindicating the genuineness of her fears. Until after representations were received from her legal representative, following her detention, no consideration was given to her fears and whether she may have good grounds for seeking asylum. Her detention was authorised without consideration of her Home Office file. There was no assessment of the alternatives to detention and no explanation for the decision that she was highly likely to abscond.
I accepted the claimant’s submission that there was a reckless disregard for her rights. No witness was called by the Home Office to explain why the claimant was treated as she was. Those making decisions to detain others should act with the utmost care, following the policies and procedures that are there to protect the individual’s rights and freedoms and there were multiple failures in the current case.” (My emboldening).
The law on exemplary damages in the context of a claim for UD can be summarised as follows. Firstly, aggravated damages must be clearly distinguished as separate from and different to exemplary damages. Aggravated damages may be awarded where, in addition to and separate from the normal damages arising from and to compensate for the UD, further compensation is just and necessary to compensate for the manner in which the tort was committed by the Appellant which resulted in humiliation or injury to the Claimant’s dignity, pride and self-respect, see for instance Clerk & Lindsell on Torts, 24th Ed at para 26-180 and Rookes v Barnard [1964] A.C. 1129, per Lord Devlin at pages 1221 and 1230. They are not intended to be punitive. They are compensatory. There has been commentary and discussion about whether aggravated damages are needed at all in the light of the ability of normal damages to cover not only pain, suffering and loss of amenity but also injury to feelings and self-respect, see for instance the Law Commission Report No. 247 of 1997. However, this case does not call for that to be determined because the Appellant conceded the Claimant was entitled to an award of aggravated damages on the liability findings.
In contrast to aggravated damages, exemplary damages are punitive, intended to be a deterrent and are a mark of serious disapproval of the outrageous abuse of power through tortious conduct of an organ of the State with a view to preventing recurrence in future. The gateway through which a claimant must pass to receive such an award includes the need to prove that the State’s tortious abuse of power was outrageous and needs to be punished and deterred, see, Rowlands v C.C. of Merseyside [2006] EWCA Civ. 1773. In Takitota v AG [2009] UKPC 11, the claimants had been wrongfully imprisoned for 4 years. Lord Carswell, in the Privy Council, summarised the law relating to exemplary damages as follows:
The award of exemplary damages is a common law head of damages, the object of which is to punish the defendant for outrageous behaviour and deter him and others from repeating it. One of the residual categories of behaviour in respect of which exemplary damages may properly be awarded is oppressive, arbitrary or unconstitutional action by the servants of the government, the ground relied upon by the Court of Appeal in the present case. It serves, as Lord Devlin said in Rookes v Barnard [1964] AC 1229 at 1223, to restrain such improper use of executive power. Both Lord Devlin in Rookes v Barnard and Lord Hailsham of St Marylebone LC in Broome v Cassell & Co Ltd [1972] AC 1027 at 1081 emphasised the need for moderation in assessing exemplary damages.”
It is clear to me from the Recorder’s judgment that she summarised the law correctly and nothing in the Appellant’s submissions disclosed any defects in her summary of the law.  The next question is whether the factual findings which the Recorder made justified an award of exemplary damages. This was an evaluative decision which must be made using an objective test of what the woman on the Tooting Tube or the man on the Sheffield Tram would consider to be outrageous abuse of power by a Government department which needs punishment and deterrence, bearing in mind that the taxpayer will be paying.
There is a scope for this evaluative judgment and the Recorder had the advantage of seeing the key witness, the claimant, and experiencing from her live evidence what she went through and seeing how the Appellant approached their explanation of what they did. I consider that the Recorder’s ruling was not wrong on exemplary damages. The right to liberty was at stake. The Appellant’s failure to read the Claimant’s Home Office file was a failure to follow what the Appellant itself noted it should do to self inform at least on her state of mind and expectations.  The fears expressed by the Claimant on detention about any return to Pakistan were ignored. The other foundations for the finding of unlawful detention, which were all breaches of policy, included: the total failure to consider alternatives to detention; the failure properly to risk assess; the failure to explain the risk assessment results; the failure to keep records of decisions and reasons for them and the failure to obtain the necessary senior authority. This number of failures could be called “wholesale”. The Recorder regarded it as “Reckless Disregard”. In addition, the Appellant continued it’s disdainful approach to the seriousness of the issues through its decision to call no decision maker or system function evidence before the Court and to make no effort to discharge the burden of proof on key matters relating to the liberty of the subject. Furthermore, there had been no internal disciplinary action or investigation into the case.
As for the quantum of the award, in Muuse Thomas LJ noted the following guidelines on quantum arising from Thompson and updated them to 2010 values (14 years ago):
80. The amount of the award for exemplary damages
As I have set out at paragraph 51 above, the judge awarded £27,500. He did so following the guidance given by Lord Woolf in Thompson at p 516:
Where exemplary damages are appropriate they are unlikely to be less than £5,000. Otherwise the case is probably not one which justifies an award of exemplary damages at all. In this class of action the conduct must be particularly deserving of condemnation for an award of as much as £25,000 to be justified and the figure of £50,000 should be regarded as the absolute maximum, involving directly officers of at least the rank of superintendent.”
81.As the judge pointed out these figures as adjusted for inflation are £6,800, £34,000 and £68,000 respectively.
…
I cannot accept this submission. The judge carefully approached the question of quantum. The conduct was an arbitrary abuse of executive power which can readily be characterised as outrageous. It could have merited an award at the mid-point of the range suggested in Thompson, but the judge made an award a little below that figure. As an amount, £27,500 is miniscule in the context of the Home Office budget, but such an award was needed to stigmatise the conduct of the officials at the Home Office as an outrageous and arbitrary exercise of executive power for the reasons I have given.”
The Recorder’s award of £12,000 is at the lower end of the awards scale, particularly taking into account the last 14 years of inflation, and I do not consider that it was outside the reasonable scope of awards which the Recorder could have made on the unchallenged facts which she found.  For the above reasons I dismiss the appeal in relation to the award of exemplary damages under G2.  I regard it as modest.
G3: Limitation and the Art.8 claim
In G3, the Appellant seeks to set aside the award of damages made under Art.8 of the ECHR on the basis that the claim was limitation barred by section 7(5)(a) of the Human Rights Act 1998 which imposes a 12 month time limit. The submission was made that the limitation defence was pleaded but not dealt with in the judgment.  This ground rather collapsed at the appeal hearing when I asked about the delay during the period for 12 months before the claim was issued.  At that time the Appellant changed the submission from a total limitation bar to a partial one for all the delay before the 12 months before issue. The Claim Form was issued on 19.2.2021. The claimed delay period pleaded was from June 2018 to February 2021, the Recorder’s finding was October 2018 to February 2021 when the Appellant informed the Respondent that her refugee status was to be granted.  The Appellant relied on no case law for this ground.
In response, the Respondent pointed out that the Appellant never raised this in submissions at the trial. Furthermore, the Respondent submitted that this was a continuing default claim, lasting 2 years and 9 months during which time the Appellant failed to assess her claim. It was submitted that, for continuing breaches, the limitation period does not start to run until the delay ends (and the decision was made in this case).  The decision was made in February 2021. The Respondent relied on paras. 23, 29 and 30 of the decision of Lord Lloyd-Jones in O’Connor v BSB [2017] UKSC 78 which are set out below:
The expression “the date on which the act complained of took place” is apt to address a single event. However, the provision should not be read narrowly. There will be many situations in which the conduct which gives rise to the infringement of a Convention right will not be an instantaneous act but a course of conduct. The words of section 7(5)(a) should be given a meaning which enables them to apply to a continuing act of alleged incompatibility. While it is correct that section 7(5)(b) may often empower a court to grant an extension of time to bring proceedings in respect of a course of conduct which has extended over a period of longer than a year, leaving a claimant to have recourse to such a discretionary remedy is inappropriate. It cannot justify limiting the scope of section 7(5)(a) The primary provision in 7(5)(a) must be capable of providing an effective and workable rule for situations where the infringement arises from a course of conduct.”
…
I consider that the alleged infringement of Convention rights in the present case arises from a single continuous course of conduct. Although disciplinary proceedings brought by the BSB necessarily involve a series of steps, the essence of the complaint made here is the initiation and pursuit of the proceedings to their conclusion, ie the entirety of the course of conduct as opposed to any component steps. As Lord Dyson MR observed in the Court of Appeal (at para 21) without expressing a concluded view on this issue, prosecution is a single process in which the prosecutor takes many steps. It cannot have been the intention of Parliament that each step should be an “act” to which the one year limitation period should apply. I also note in this regard that, were it otherwise, a prosecution which lasted longer than one year could not be relied on in its entirety as a basis of complaint unless proceedings were commenced before the conclusion of the disciplinary proceedings or relief were granted under section 7(5)(b). A claimant would be placed in the difficult position of having to bring a human rights claim within one year of the commencement of what might be lengthy proceedings, without knowing the outcome which might be very material to the claim.
On the basis that we are concerned here with a single continuing act of alleged incompatibility, I agree with Lord Hope in Somerville (at para 51) that time runs from the date when the continuing act ceased, not when it began.”
Furthermore, Sedley LJ had long before ruled in Home office v Mohammad [2011] EWCA Civ. 351, at para.5 that:
… As it happens, the limitation point is answered in the pleaded reply in two ways. The principal reply is that the breach which is complained of was in each case an act which continued until the grant of ILR or the concession of the claim; the alternative reply is that it is equitable in the circumstances to enlarge time. It seems to me that the first of these propositions is correct. In measuring time from “the date on which the act complained of took place”, both the language and the purpose of s.7(5) are apt to include the last day of a continuing act.”
In my judgment the case law is clear and the limitation defence was bad in law on the facts of this case.  Therefore, the Appellant’s G3 is dismissed.
G4: Art.8 Threshold
The Recorder found the Appellant’s delay and the restrictive conditions imposed for the duration of the delay constituted a disproportionate breach of the Claimant’s rights under Art.8 from October 2018 to February 2021.  In G4 (paras. 6.21-6.26 of the skeleton) the Appellant submitted that the Recorder was wrong to find that the restrictions imposed upon the Claimant engaged Art.8 by breaching her qualified rights. The Appellant submitted that the Recorder misdirected herself about Hans Husson v SSHD [2020] EWCA Civ. 329, by failing to understand how challenging the requirements are to qualify.  The Appellant also submitted that there was no hint that the Recorder applied the requisite high threshold. The Appellant sought to distinguish the decision in Husson on the facts. Firstly, the Claimant had no right to work in England, whereas Mr Husson did have the right to work.  Secondly, Husson was a strike out application and the Court did not find that delay founded breach. Thirdly, it was submitted that the Courts do not award damages for breach for mere prevention of work. Fourthly, the Claimant could have applied to work but did not. Fifthly, the Recorder ignored the balance struck in the immigration legislation which provides some financial asylum support to asylum seekers. Husson was an appeal from a refusal to grant permission for judicial review of a decision that he could not challenge the SSHD’s delay in granting his work permit after he was granted leave to stay in England and so could not claim damages for lost income from work.  Simler J. found that the Claimant had an arguable claim only under Art.8 so permission was granted. The Appellant relied on paras. 36-37 of the judgment. I set out below those paragraphs and some others for full context, which contained the following rulings:
To establish a breach of his article 8 rights, the appellant must establish an interference with the exercise of his right to respect for his private and family life that has had such serious consequences as to engage the operation of article 8. …
Although there is no direct authority which establishes that a right to work is of itself protected by article 8, and article 8 does not give a right to choose or pursue a particular occupation, the Strasbourg authorities referred to in Atapattu demonstrate that where an individual is wholly or substantially deprived of the ability to work altogether, article 8(1) is at least arguably engaged. I accept that the threshold is high.
Damages for breach of a Convention right may be awarded under s. 8 of the Human Rights Act 1998 where that is necessary to afford just satisfaction to a person who has suffered loss as a result. There are many cases where an award of damages will not be necessary to afford just satisfaction because a finding of a violation of the Convention right, and the fact that remedies are available on judicial review which will bring about an end to the violation, may constitute just satisfaction. However, as was made clear in Anufrijeva v Southwark LBC [2003] EWCA Civ 1406, [2004] QB 1124 (at [59]) where the established breach has clearly caused significant pecuniary loss, this will usually be assessed and awarded.
It is now conceded as a matter of fact, that without a BRP or a stamp in his passport evidencing the right to work, the appellant was unable to take up any lawful employment in the UK because he would not be able to satisfy a UK employer of his entitlement to work lawfully. In those circumstances, the only basis on which it is now argued that there was not a total deprivation is by reference to the possibility of the appellant returning to Mauritius to work there.
It seems to me that as a matter of real world practicality, the appellant was prevented altogether from securing employment during the period of delay. It is unrealistic to expect him to have returned to Mauritius in a period when he expected to receive a BRP at any moment, had the right to remain here by reason of his family life here, and had the right to work here. Moreover, leaving the UK would have involved leaving behind his British wife and child.”
The Respondent submitted that these points were not raised before the trial judge. In addition, the Respondent submitted that the facts of her case at trial were extraordinary because the Appellant did not ask for any further information during the 2 years and 9 months delay period and provided no explanation for any of the delay. The real issue was “when did the unlawful delay start?” The Recorder allowed the Appellant 6 months to make the decision thus determined that the breach commenced in October 2018.
The Recorder set out in her judgment that the Appellant asked for permission to make further submissions on this head of claim and was allowed to make them in relation to the start date for the delay. The Recorder stated that the law was not in dispute between the parties and summarised it as follows:
“40 In relation to Article 8, I was taken in particular to two cases: the case of Hans Husson v SSHD [2020] EWCA Civ. 329, and also Atapattu v SSHD [2011] EWHC 1388. That was for the principle in reliance on Hans Husson that the impact on the claimant’s Article 8 rights was sufficiently serious to engage the operation of Article 8. If Article 8 was engaged, it was for the defendant to establish the interference in the claimant’s right to respect for her private and family life was lawful and proportionate: Atapattu. The claimant relied upon the fact that there was no evidence advanced by the defendant regarding the circumstances of the delay.”
In Atapattu v SSHD [2011] EWHC 1388 (Admin), the defendant withheld the claimant’s passport which prevented him from working as a seaman in the merchant navy. Stephen Morris QC sitting as a deputy ruled that the threshold for a claimant to cross in an Art.8 claims was as follows:
Accordingly, this part of the claim turns wholly on whether Mr. Atapattu can establish that there has been an interference with his right to respect for his private life under Article 8(1). That in turn raises two issues: whether the consequences of the Defendant's conduct for Mr. Atapattu fell within the scope of the concept of ""private life"" under Article 8(1) and if so, whether, that conduct amounted to a sufficient interference with Mr. Atapattu's private life.”
Stephen Morris QC did not consider that the claimant’s right to work was wholly abolished in Atapattu and found that Art.8 was not engaged on the fact because he could  work on land.  In the process he reviewed two other cases in which Art.8 was considered to have been broken: Smirnova v. Russia [2004] 39 EHRR 22, and Sidabras v. Lithuania [2006] 42 EHRR 6. In Smirnova the Russian authorities retained the applicant's national identity paper, her ""internal passport"". The European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) held that this infringed the applicant's right to a private life under Article 8:
The Court has a number of times ruled that private life is a broad term not susceptible to exhaustive definition..... It has nevertheless been outlined that it protects the moral and physical integrity of the individual ... , including the right to live privately, away from unwanted attention. It also secures to the individual a sphere which he or she can freely pursue the
development and fulfilment of his personality ... .
... the interference with [the applicant's] private life is peculiar in that it allegedly flows not from an instantaneous act, but from a number of everyday inconveniences taken in their entirety which lasted [for over four years]. ...
The Court finds it established that in their everyday life Russian citizens have to prove their identity unusually often, even when performing such mundane tasks as exchanging currency or buying train tickets. The internal passport is also required for more crucial needs, for example, finding employment or receiving medical care. The deprivation of the passport therefore represented a continuing interference with the applicant's private life ...""
Stephen Morris QC commented on Smirnova as follows:
It was the cumulative effect on this wide variety of aspects of the applicant's life which was held to constitute the interference with private life. The requirement for proof of identity was ""unusually"" frequent in Russia. As regards impact upon ability to work, this was one only of a number of effects of the deprivation of the passport, and in any event it appeared to be the case that the internal passport was required to be able to do any work whatsoever.”
At para 146 in Atapattu Stephen Morris QC went on to summarise the facts in Sidabras in which the European Court of Human Rights also considered that the claimant’s rights under Art.8 were infringed by the State.  He was, as a former KGB officer, dismissed from his job and debarred from working in a wide range of public and private employment when Lithuania became a republic
The Recorder considered the facts against the case law put before her and determined that the conditions imposed on the Claimant did constitute interference with the Claimant’s Art.8 rights thus:
… Her case was set out in her in her particulars of claim, where she said that throughout the period alleged she was required to comply with restrictions placed on her residence in the UK, and she was not permitted to travel, live freely and develop her private and family life as her status in the UK was uncertain. She was unable to work or claim any public funds and had to survive on the basis of very little support provided by the asylum system and relying on assistance from friends and family, which undermined her self-esteem and caused her embarrassment. She relied on particulars, first of all, relating to her son’s claim, which she said was in all material respects identical to hers (a submission I did not accept). Then that her claim was not considered within a reasonable period of time, which meant there was delay in determining her refugee status.”
…
… It seemed to me that what I am being asked to consider in the current case was a period of delay, and when a period of time can properly be characterised as a period of unreasonable delay ..”
…
Having further considered the matter, I accepted the claimant’s submission that Article 8 was engaged here after the claimant’s release from detention on 23 April 2018. She could not travel, she could not move freely, she could not develop her private and family life because her status was uncertain, and she could not work or claim public funds, and had to rely on the little support from the asylum system. She was wholly unable to work and her home life was affected by the anxiety she felt following her period of detention, feeling like a criminal and not a good person with her friends and family because she had been detained.
In terms of when the breach of the claimant’s Article 8 right became disproportionate, I consider that was about six months after her release.”
…
… There was no evidence from the defendant in relation to the period of delay, and even if the period was taken only from October 2018, which is a six-month period, a period well in excess of two years remains unexplained. The defendant did not meet the burden of showing the interference over that period was lawful and proportionate.”
In my judgment the Recorder was correct to rule, on the facts, that the Claimant’s Art.8 rights were breached by the conditions imposed by the Appellant. She could not claim State Benefits and was restricted to the limited sums paid to asylum seekers. Her ability to work and earn was abolished. Her ability to socialise, buy food, eat out, build a social or religious life and all other aspects of her life was grossly restricted. She was also prevented from travelling.  She could not build her status in society or her self-respect.  The partly comparable cases considered in Atapattu are of some assistance in that decision.  The restrictions on the Claimant were far broader than just preventing her from working or earning altogether.
There was a second part to the appeal under this ground, relating to liability. This was scattered through paras. 6.29 - 6.34 of the skeleton.  The Appellant asserted that “mere” administrative delay does not amount to breach of Art.8 and so no claim can arise. The Appellant also asserted that it was for the Respondent to prove illegality not for the Appellant to justify legality. The Appellant relied on the submissions that the Court should not concern itself with maladministration, it should only focus on illegality and should avoid a generalised and unfocussed idea of fairness, relying (at para. 6.30 of the skeleton) on para. 46 of the judgment of an unnamed Judge in SQH [2009] EWCA Civ. 142. This case was not in the authorities bundle. Having found the case I see that the paragraph referred to was from the judgment of Goldring LJ. The claim concerned nationals of Afghanistan and Sierra Leone who sought indefinite leave to remain but were denied this by what they asserted was illegality or error by the authorities and breach of their legitimate expectations. Central to the claims was the assertion that the SSHD should have applied to the claimants a policy which had been withdrawn by the time of consideration.  At para. 46 Goldring LJ ruled thus:
Third, I do not accept Mr. Gill's submission that it would be sufficient effectively to oblige the Secretary of State to apply the policy after it has been withdrawn where the failure to apply it during its currency was lawful; where, for example, there was historically administrative delay or (possibly very serious and widespread) administrative inefficiency which did not amount to unlawfulness in the way I have defined it. The whole basis of applications such as the present is a previous unlawful failure to apply the policy. I cannot see how a previous lawful failure to apply the policy can give rise to a subsequent intervention by the court on the basis that the policy having been withdrawn, the Secretary of State should have taken it into account and having done so, was bound to grant ILR. There can moreover be no question of intervention by the court on the basis of a generalised and unfocussed idea of fairness; or by consideration of what subsequently may have happened to the individual in question and categorised in broad terms such as prejudice, loss and detriment. In other words, I do not accept Mr. Gill's submission that Carnwath LJ was wrong in this regard.”
I consider that the decision in SHQ is not directly relevant to nor determinative of the issue which the Recorder had to decide.
The Appellant went on to submit that because Parliament had set no timescale for the time within which the Appellant was to make a decision on the Claimant’s fresh claim, the Courts should decline to impose any timescale. The Appellant relied on the judgment of Garnham J. in R (on the application of O) v SSHD [2019] EWHC 148, in which a challenge was made to a system operated by the SSHD. The claim failed.  The claimant asserted that the making of a conclusive grounds decision for him under the National Referral Mechanism was too slow and hence unlawful.  It took 34 months. The Appellant served and relied upon witness evidence showing exponential growth in applications, limited resources, prioritisation, reduced waiting times, a public body report into the delays and concerns raised by MPs and others. Garnham J ruled as follows:
The difficulty lies in identifying how the requirement to take decisions within reasonable periods is to be applied to a challenge such as this one. As Carnwath LJ said in S v SSHD in the passage immediately following that cited at paragraph 68 above, an obligation to deal with an application in a reasonable time says little in itself. Such an obligation:
“…is a flexible concept, allowing scope for variation depending
not only on the volume of applications and available resources to deal with them, but also on differences in the circumstances and needs of different groups of asylum seekers. But…in resolving such competing demands”
Garnham J. then identified two factors which he decided he had to take into account to determine the delay claims: (1) systematically unlawful delays which are unfair; (2) chronic delays.  In relation to (1) he identified two categories of applicants, those with an established right awaiting official paperwork and those with no established right awaiting a decision on that right. He found himself in alignment with Collins J. in R (FH) v SSHD [2007] EWHC 1571 (Admin) in which he ruled that resources are relevant and so was the evidence from the Appellant about the system and why it is a reasonable one, thus:
Thus, FH was not a case of an established right. At paragraph 11 Collins J held:
“Here the question is whether the delay was unlawful. It can only
be regarded as unlawful if it fails the Wednesbury test and is shown to result from actions or inactions which can be regarded as irrational … What may be regarded as undesirable or a failure to reach the best standards is not unlawful. Resources can be taken into account in considering whether a decision has been made within a reasonable time, but (assuming the threshold has been crossed) the defendant must produce some material to show that the manner in which he has decided to deal with the relevant claims and the resources put into the exercise are reasonable. That does not mean that the court should determine for itself whether a different and perhaps better approach might have existed. That is not the court's function. But the court can and must consider whether what has produced the delay has resulted from a rational system. If unacceptable delays have resulted, they cannot be excused by a claim that sufficient resources were not available. But in deciding whether the delays are unacceptable, the court must recognise that resources are not infinite and that it is for the defendant and not for the court to determine how those resources should be applied to fund the various matters for which he is responsible.””
Garnham J then took into account the rulings of LJ Jackson in R (Arbab) v SSHD [2002] EWHC 1249 (Admin) which were as follows:
One aspect of the separation of powers is that the court will not generally involve itself in questions concerning the management of a government department or similar body: see Inland Revenue Commissioners v National Federation of Self-Employed and Small Businesses Ltd [1982] AC 617 , at 635 (per Lord Wilberforce), and at 636 and 644 (per Lord Diplock). There are at least three good reasons for this abstinence on the part of the
courts:
How resources should be allocated between competing priorities and how government ministers should organise their administrative systems are political questions. Judges are not elected and it is not their function to decide such questions.
The courts do not have the expertise to review the performance of government departments at this level of generality.
Under our constitutional arrangements there are other more effective mechanisms for calling to account ministers and senior civil servants who mismanage their departments or mis-allocate resources. These mechanisms include Parliamentary questions and, more importantly, the scrutiny of select committees: see de Smith, Woolf & Jowell “Judicial Review of Administrative Action” (Fifth Edition) 1995 at”
As a result, Garnham J. constructed the following propositions:
From those cases I draw the following principles which seem to me relevant to the present case:
Delay may be unlawful when the right in question arises as a matter of established status and the delay causes hardship (Phansopkar).
An authority acts unlawfully if it fails to have regard to the fact that what is in issue is an established right rather than the claim to a right (Mersin).
Delay is also unlawful if it is shown to result from actions or inactions which can be regarded as irrational. However, a failure merely to reach the best standards is not unlawful (FH).
The  court will not generally involve itself in questions concerning the internal management of a government department (Inland Revenue Commissioners v National Federation of Self-Employed and Small Businesses Ltd and Arbab)
The provision of inadequate resources by Government may be relevant to a charge of systematically unlawful delay, but the Courts will be wary of deciding questions that turn on the allocation of scarce resources (Arbab).”
None of these matters of law were in dispute in this appeal. The problem which the Appellant faced was much more basic.  The Appellant chose not to serve or rely on any evidence to show what the system was, how much it cost, how many applications were within it, what turnover rate it had, how many staff were employed, what cost was involved, what demands were made of it’s resources, or any evidence whatsoever. Stripping away all the fog on this issue it comes down, in my judgment, to a very simple question:  “Once the Claimant has established a sufficiently serious breach of her Art.8 rights and the burden shifts to the Defendant, the Court must ask: has the Defendant discharged the burden of proof to show that the interference was necessary and proportionate?”  That question can, depending on the evidence, be rephrased in this case as: “for this Claimant, in her circumstances, taking into account the conditions imposed upon her, how long was it reasonable for the Defendant to take to make the decision on her fresh claim?”  Had the Appellant served and relied on evidence then, applying the Garnham J. factors, the Appellant might have shown that 2 years and 9 month was not unlawful because it was necessary and proportionate. However, in the absence of any evidence from the Appellant, the Recorder was still required to determine the issue and did so.  She decided that 6 months was a reasonable period in the circumstances on the evidence before her (or to be more precise on evidence from only the Claimant). I do not consider that approach to be illogical or wrong, nor do I consider that her assessment of the delay period was irrational or inappropriate on the evidence before her.  The Appellant submits that this time limit will applied to other claims. I think not, unless of course (1) the factual matrix is the same, which seems unlikely, and (2) the Appellant fails to serve any evidence in other cases.
G5: A declaration
The Appellant asserted that the Recorder should have issued a declaration instead of awarding damages and asserted that the level of damages was not supported by the evidence and was excessive. The Respondent answered by relying on the findings of fact which were not challenged and the fact that the Recorder accepted the Claimant’s evidence of loss. In relation to pecuniary loss, after the long delayed decision to accept her Asylum claim, within a few weeks the Claimant obtained paid work as a live-in carer and produced her pay slips to the Court.  Her case was simply that this would have occurred earlier, had the Appellant made the decision earlier. No evidence was submitted on the effects of Covid during the period. The Recorder’s decisions on quantum are set out at paras. 41-47. I do not consider that her approach was unsupported by evidence or excessive. She took 4.5 weeks off the sums claimed for a job search period. In relation to general damages, the Recorder awarded £5,000 for the nervousness of having to report to the Appellant monthly with fear of detention each time and for being in “limbo” for 2 years and 3 months. I do not consider that level of award to be outside the reasonable scale available on the evidence.
G6: costs
Under this ground the Appellant seeks to overturn the interim payment on account of costs.  The Appellant accepts that the award on the indemnity basis was correctly made. The trial took 3 days.  There was no costs budget from the Claimant because she was treated as a litigant in person (albeit she had a DPA barrister). The Appellant’s costs budget was £35,000 plus VAT for defending the claim assuming a one day trial.   I did ask the parties to put in any reference to the transcript on this or any other issue but none was put in.  The relevant part of the transcript is below:
“THE RECORDER: Then there is the question of payment on account of costs and what has been requested is £35,000 plus VAT.
MR CROSSLEY: Your Honour, I have not any specific instructions in relation to that. I want to try to take a reasonable position, but I can only observe on behalf of the defence that the-- I see the reasoning behind the figure that is arrived at and I must say objectively that it does not seem that it is removed from all logic. It clearly is based on a figure that is reached.
THE RECORDER: Yes.
MR CROSSLEY: And that being said, I think I ought to, in the absence of any specific instructions, simply say that the costs and the value-- the budget has not been-- it does not exist and, therefore, a true appreciation of the costs is not known and I would resist any payment on account on that ground.
THE RECORDER: Any payment on account?
MR CROSSLEY: Well, if it is not £35,000, you will not hear from the defence an alternative figure. I can only say that I do not have specific instructions to agree that and your Honour will make your own decision.
THE RECORDER: I think the defendant clearly should make a payment on account. I have to be cautious not to make a payment that might exceed the costs that would be payable. I am going to make an order for £30,000. it 1 seems to me it is a three-day-- you know, it has been a 2 three-day multi-track case. I cannot believe there is any risk in the costs at the end of the day 3 being less than that. So £30,000 plus VAT.
Is there anything else we can deal with today?”
So, the Appellant did not put up much of a fight on the quantum of the requested payment on account.  The CPR empower the Judge to make an order for a payment on account against a losing party. This is because the winning party’s lawyers may have carried the claim and been paid no costs all the way through and costs assessment takes time.  In the absence of any evidence that the costs of the Claimant’s barrister were excessive for all the DPA work done for her, including the emergency work done whilst she was in detention, the correspondence, pleading the claim, dealing with interim hearings and the 3 day trial for this multi-track case, or any evidence that the costs were less than the costs on account ordered, I consider that the order made by the Recorder was not demonstrably wrong.  In any event, the costs should have been assessed by now, furthermore a full bill of costs should have been served.  None was put before me so this is or should have been water under the bridge.
The Appeal
For the reasons set out above I dismiss the appeal on all of the grounds put forwards and I dismiss all of the sub grounds within each ground.

DECISION
INTRODUCTION
This decision deals with a strike out application which has been brought by HMRC. The underlying appeal concerns their decision which was issued on 2 May 2023 relating to import duties on goods which were declared by the appellant between 5 May 2020 and 22 December 2022. The goods comprised a substance called maltodextrin which the appellant had imported under commodity code 17 02 90 95 00. HMRC consider that the product should have been imported under commodity code 17 02 90 50 00 and have issued post clearance demands totalling £91,305.61 to recover the customs duty and associated input VAT which, in their view, should have been paid by the appellant on importation.
The appellant has appealed against those post-clearance demands. It does so on the basis that maltodextrin should be classified under 19 01 90 99 90.
In HMRC’s view this is an attempt to place maltodextrin under a code which is not permitted by primary legislation. This is contrary to the clear intention of Parliament and the tribunal does not have power to rewrite the legislation or revise the Tariff. Consequently, the tribunal has no jurisdiction to consider the appeal which must be struck out.
In the alternative, the appeal has no reasonable prospect of success.
THE LAW
There was little dispute about the relevant law. I have set out the law in relation to striking out in the Appendix. The detailed legislation, both European and domestic, relating to the correct customs code is fiendishly complicated. I am indebted to Ms Hickey for guiding me through it. I have set out below the law which I consider to be relevant to the underlying dispute in this appeal.
In order to impose customs duty on cross-border trade, countries have established systems for the classification of goods based on international law. When the UK was part of the EU, this system was based on the Combined Nomenclature (“CN”) of the EU. Following the withdrawal of the UK from the EU, the UK Tariff system was established by the Customs Tariff (Establishment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2020 (“the Exit Regulations”).
Under both the CN and the Tariff established by the Exit Regulations, numerical codes called commodity codes, are allocated to goods which are classified accordingly. This code then determines the rate of duty applicable to the goods.
That classification process takes account of a number of characteristics using legally binding rules known as the General Interpretive Rules (“GIR’s”).
Rule 1 states “The titles of Sections, Chapters and sub-Chapters are provided for ease of reference only; for legal purposes, classification shall be determined according to the terms of the headings and any relative Section or Chapter Notes and, provided such headings Notes do not otherwise require, according to the following provisions…”.
Under regulation 3 of the Exit Regulations:
For the purposes of determining the commodity codes within which goods most appropriately fall, the rules of interpretation contained in the following have effect—
Part Two (Goods Classification Table Rules of Interpretation) of the Tariff of the United Kingdom; and
notes to a section or chapter of the Goods Classification Table”.
The Goods Classification Table means the table so named in the UK Tariff which in turn means the document entitled “the Tariff of the United Kingdom” (“the Tariff”). The original version of this was dated 7 November 2023, but it is revised on an annual basis.
What this essentially means is that where goods, or a product, is specifically identified by a heading or a Chapter note, that heading or Chapter note has the rule of law and it is obligatory that the product is classified under that Chapter.
Goods are classified by way of a numerical code containing 10 digits. The first two digits relate to the Chapter and the next two to the heading within that Chapter number.
In this case there are three Chapters within the Tariff which are under consideration.
Chapter 35 of the Tariff deals with, amongst other things, Albuminoidal substances and modified starches.
Under code 35 05 which describes “Dextrins and other modified starches…” Chapter note 2 states:
“For the purposes of heading 35 05, the term ‘dextrins’ means starch degradation products with a reducing sugar content, expressed as dextrose on the dry substance, not exceeding 10%. Such products with a reducing sugar content exceeding 10% fall in heading 1702”.
Chapter 17 is headed “Sugars and sugar confectionery” and contains four headings. Heading 17 02 is entitled “other sugars, including chemically pure lactose, maltose, glucose and fructose…”.
When using the online version, if you click on this heading, it takes you to a screen which contains a number of headings and subheadings. Under the heading “Other, including invert sugar …” there is a subheading entitled “Maltodextrine and maltodextrine syrup”, against which is the commodity code 17 02 90 50 00, and the appropriate duty rate.
Chapter 19 is entitled “Preparations of cereals, flour, starch or milk; pastrycooks’ products”. It contains (substantially paraphrased) five headings. Malt extract etc; pasta; tapioca and substitutes; prepared foods obtained by the swelling or roasting of cereals; and bread pastry cakes and biscuits.
The first of these headings, 19 01, which is where the appellant asserts the maltodextrin should be classified, describes the classification more fully as follows:
“Malt extract; food preparations of flour, groats, meal, starch or malt extract, not containing cocoa or containing less than 40 % by weight of cocoa calculated on a totally defatted basis, not elsewhere specified or included; food preparations of goods of headings 0401 to 0404, not containing cocoa or containing less than 5 % by weight of cocoa calculated on a totally defatted basis, not elsewhere specified or included”.
Explanatory notes to aid interpretation of the GN called the Harmonised System Explanatory Notes (“the Explanatory Notes”) are not binding but on the authority of the ECJ decision in British Sky Broadcasting Group Limited (C-288-09) published 14 April 2011, “may be an important aid to the interpretation of the scope of the various headings…” [63].
The explanatory notes relating to Chapter 17 deal with maltodextrin at subsection (6) under the heading “Other Sugars”, in the following terms:
“Malto-dextrins (or dextri-maltoses), obtained by the same process as commercial glucose. They contain maltose and polysaccharides in variable proportions. However, they are less hydrolysed and therefore have a lower reducing sugar content than commercial glucose. The heading covers only such products with a reducing sugar content, expressed as dextrose on the dry substance, exceeding 10 % (but less than 20 %). Those with a reducing sugar content not exceeding 10 % fall in heading 35.05. Malto-dextrins are generally in the form of white powders, but they are also marketed in the form of a syrup (see Part (B)). They are used chiefly in the manufacture of baby food and low-calory dietetic foods, as extenders for flavouring substances or food colouring agents, and in the pharmaceutical industry as carriers”.
THE EVIDENCE AND THE FACTS
I was provided with a bundle of documents from which I find the following:
The appellant imported maltodextrin on 9 occasions between 5 May 2020 and 22 December 2022 under commodity code 17 02 90 95 00. This code has a duty rate of £0.3 per 100 kg/% saccharide. Prior to 1 January 2021 the rate was €0.4/100 kg/% saccharide.
In February 2023, HMRC requested relevant paperwork to carry out post clearance checks on these imports. The appellant provided the relevant documentation.
HMRC concluded, based on this information, that the imported product fell under commodity code 17 02 90 50 00 covering “maltodextrine and maltodextrine syrup”.
In a letter dated 14 April 2023, Grant Thornton LLP, acting on behalf of the appellant, said this:
“We have looked at the ATR decisions that you are provided, one of which is quoted as “Maltodextrin with High DE. The product is a scentless, white powder-polysaccharides, oligosaccharides. It has a dextrose equivalent minimum of 15% and maximum of 20%. The product is within bags made of Laminated polypropylene food grades”.
Whilst we agree that the products fit into the correct dextrose equivalent range, our argument for the goods to be classified within 17 0290 9500 centres around the fact product is a dextrin and not a maltodextrin as described in the tariff….”.
On 3 May 2023 a decision letter was issued to the appellant as were the post clearance demands. In HMRC’s view, the product should have been classified under code 17 02 90 50 00, and were therefore subject to a duty rate of £16/100 kg (pre-1 January 2021 this was €20/100kg. They assessed the appellant to customs duty and import VAT of £91,305.61.
On 9 May 2023, Grant Thornton LLP, on behalf of the appellant, requested a statutory review.
The statutory review upheld the decision that the product should have been classified under 17 02 90 50 00, and revised the amount due by reducing it by 8p.
On 29 June 2023 the appellant filed a notice of appeal with the tribunal.
In its grounds of appeal, the appellant states that:
“Maltodextrin should not fall under the 1702 heading, due to not being sugar and being a starch product. This is the reason why we initially opted for a commodity code within the same chapter as 1702905000 ‘Maltodextrin’, but one which stated ‘other’ as we did not believe our product satisfied the conditions set out in the 1702 heading description.
After receiving the RTBH and further investigating this product, we now understand that the product should not have been classified within the ‘sugar and sugar confectionery’ heading at all.
Our argument is that specifically Maltodextrin should not fall into chapter 17 as it does not satisfy the 2 digit heading title in itself ‘Sugar and sugar confectionery’.
We accept that we describe the product as ‘Maltodextrin’ or ‘Sugar Free Maltodextrin’ on our commercial documents, specifically on our invoices. This does not change the fact that our Maltodextrin does not fit into chapter 17, due to Maltodextrin having a low DE account and it should as such be classified as a starch (and not a sugar) …
Based on the above, we now understand that our product should not fall within the 1702 chapter and should be classified under commodity code 1901 1909 990 as it is a starch and not a sugar.
It does not make any logical sense for this product to fall into chapter 17 ‘Sugar and sugar confectionery’ as it does not contain any sugar”.
DISCUSSION
Submissions
In summary Ms Hickey submitted as follows:
Maltodextrin is listed specifically in the subheading within Chapter 17 of the Tariff. Accordingly, in accordance with the interpretation provisions in the GIR’s and the Explanatory Notes, the correct commodity code is that which HMRC have now confirmed to the appellant, namely 17 02 90 50 00.
The Chapter notes to Chapter 35, which are legally binding, specifically state that products with a reducing sugar content exceeding 10%, fall within heading 1702. Grant Thornton, on behalf of the appellant, have admitted that the maltodextrin imported by the appellant had a sugar content exceeding 10%.
Although there is nothing specifically excluding maltodextrin from being included within Chapter 19, it is evident there is no need for any specific exclusion given that maltodextrin is specifically identified within Chapter 17.
Furthermore, the notes in Chapter 19 at 1901, which deal with starch or malt extract, are subject to the provision that they are “not elsewhere specified or included”. And maltodextrin is specified or included within the Chapter notes in Chapter 35 and, more importantly, as a specific subheading in Chapter 17.
In asking the tribunal to classify the maltodextrin under Chapter 19, the appellant is asking me to interpret primary legislation in a way which is contrary to the clear intention of Parliament and is tantamount to rewriting the legislation. I have no judicial review power, and if the appellant considers that the legislation is something which could be challenged by way of judicial review, then he must bring that challenge in the High Court.
Furthermore, if the tribunal does have jurisdiction, then the appellant’s challenge has no reasonable prospects of success in light of the admission by Grant Thornton that the maltodextrin had a sugar content (or dextrose equivalent (“DE”)) of between 15% and 20%.
In summary Mr Pollard submitted as follows:
Maltodextrin is a starch and not a sugar by any accepted standards. It is a polysaccharide. This is borne out by a considerable body of authoritative literature. It has a very low DE which justifies its categorisation as a starch.
Chapter 17 and Chapter 35 both deal with sugars. Maltodextrin, not being sugar, cannot be categorised within either Chapter. This is notwithstanding that it is identified in Chapter 17, and the appellant describes the product as maltodextrin in its commercial documents, in particular invoices presented to the appellant by its supplier.
Maltodextrin is most appropriately categorised in Chapter 19 which deals with starches. There is nothing in Chapter 19 which prohibits it being classified within that Chapter.
It is not certain where the admission that the maltodextrin has a sugar content of between 15% and 20%, came from. If this matter was to further, he would have the product chemically analysed.
My view
In her oral submissions, Ms Hickey stated that three things are not in dispute. Firstly, that the product is maltodextrin. Secondly, that HMRC have classified the maltodextrin as liable to duty under commodity code 17 02 90 50 00. Thirdly, the post-clearance demand is not an appealable matter but has been issued as a result of HMRC’s decision to so classify the maltodextrin. It is that underlying decision which is the appealable matter.
Clearly, if I have no jurisdiction in relation to the proceedings, I have no alternative but to strike them out.
And HMRC submits that this is the case in that the appeal essentially asks me to accept that the categorisation of the maltodextrin under Chapter 19 is tantamount to rewriting the legislation and interpret it in a way which is contrary to the evident intention of Parliament. And I have no power to do this.
I do not see it in the same way. It is clear from the appellant’s grounds of appeal as supplemented by subsequent correspondence and in his oral submissions, that he is simply challenging HMRC’s decision to categorise the maltodextrin under Chapter 17. Although I was taken to no authority on this, my understanding is that it is clearly within the ambit of a jurisdictional appeal for him to so challenge it in this way. The appeal is against the decision to classify the maltodextrin under Chapter 17.
However, I am entirely in agreement with Ms Hickey that, subject to what I say below regarding the DE content, maltodextrin which has a DE content of more than 10%, must be classified and given a commodity code, under Chapter 17. I say this largely for the reasons that she has provided in her submissions.
The rules of interpretation under both the GIR’s and the Explanatory Notes make it clear that headings and Chapter notes in both the GN, and the Tariff have legally binding effect. So that, in essence, where an item, such as maltodextrin, is specifically identified in a heading or a Chapter note, it becomes part of the GN, or of the Tariff, and so comprises primary law.
In this case there are three factors which support the classification of the maltodextrin as being within Chapter 17. Firstly, there is a subheading within that Chapter of “maltodextrin and maltodextrin syrup”. Secondly, there are the Chapter notes in Chapter 35 which say that where dextrins have a sugar content of less than 10%, they fall in heading 1702. Finally, there are the Explanatory Notes which explain that maltodextrins which have a sugar content of more than 10% should be categorised under Chapter 17, but those with less, should fall within heading 35 05.
Mr Pollard contends that it is generally accepted that maltodextrin is a starch. And since it is not a sugar, neither Chapter 17 nor Chapter 35 is applicable. I do not accept that. Whilst there is some literature suggesting that maltodextrin is a starch, the issue for categorisation under commodity code, is not whether it is a pure starch, but whether it has a sugar content (monosaccharide and disaccharides) as well as the starch, of more than 10%. If so, as appears to be the case here, then notwithstanding that the Chapter headings might be slightly misleading, the provisions in Chapters 17 and 35 which have legally binding effect, oblige HMRC to give maltodextrin a commodity code under Chapter 17. And this is the case notwithstanding what other people, no matter how eminent, might describe maltodextrin.
If Parliament has got the description “wrong” in the eyes of those people, then that is a matter for Parliament. Both HMRC and myself have to apply the law as it stands. And as it stands, we are obliged to categorise maltodextrin with a sugar content of more than 10% under Chapter 17. In these circumstances HMRC’s decision to allocate a commodity code of 17 02 90 50 00 to maltodextrin is correct.
However, the more difficult issue for me is the apparent conflict between the admission made by Grant Thornton, on behalf of the appellant, namely that the maltodextrin had a sugar content of between 15% and 20%, and Mr Pollard’s oral submissions that he did not know where this figure had come from, and that if the matter proceeds to trial, he would have the product analysed.
I do not think that simply because the maltodextrin has been commercially described as such, it is axiomatic that it must be categorised within Chapter 17 as there is a subheading for “maltodextrin” within that Chapter. And so even if the product is described as maltodextrin on an invoice, and yet it contains, for example, gunpowder, it must automatically fall within Chapter 17.
I say this because the Chapter notes in Chapter 35, which deal with dextrins with a sugar content of more than 10%, state they fall in heading 17 02. This implies that dextrins with a sugar content of less than that fall within Chapter 35. This is borne out by the Explanatory Notes which specifically say that dextrins with a reducing sugar content not exceeding 10% fall within heading 35 05.
So it is entirely within the ambit of a permissible challenge to HMRC’s decision, for the appellant to argue that the sugar content of the maltodextrin was less than 10% and thus should not be categorised under Chapter 17. It is true that in this case the appellant does not suggest that the maltodextrin should be categorised under Chapter 35, but under Chapter 19. This may be misguided for the reasons I have already given. But that does not prevent it challenging the categorisation asserted by HMRC. If, as a matter of fact, the maltodextrin contains sugar of less than 10%, then it seems to me, as a matter of law, that it must be categorised within Chapter 35. That is irrespective of what the parties assert.
I have no doubt that this tribunal has jurisdiction to consider this. It is simply a challenge to the decision made by HMRC to categorise the maltodextrin under Chapter 17.
But as I say, the more difficult issue is the ostensible contradiction between Grant Thornton’s admission that the maltodextrin did have a sugar content of more than 10%, and the appellant’s assertion that he did not know where this came from and that if the matter proceeded to trial, he would obtain a chemical analysis.
If this had been the first time that the appellant had raised the issue, I would have rejected it. The ambit of his appeal is governed by its pleadings which are primarily in the grounds of appeal.
The appellant does raise this in its grounds of appeal. It does so generally in its broad assertion that the maltodextrin contains no sugar. And specifically, where it says that the maltodextrin has a “low DE count and it should as such be classified as a starch …”.
These grounds of appeal are then repeated in the appellant’s response to HMRC’s application to strike out, dated 21 May 2024. So it has always been the appellant’s case that the sugar content of the maltodextrin is either non-existent or sufficiently low as to justify that it should not be given a commodity code under Chapter 17 which deals with sugars.
I am conscious that strike out is a draconian remedy. I am equally conscious that I must deal with cases fairly and justly. To my mind, if it turned out that the maltodextrin did have a sugar content of less than 10%, it would not be fair and just for HMRC’s decision that it should be classified under Chapter 17, to stand.
The sugar content of the maltodextrin is at the heart of this dispute. Whilst there is some ambivalence about it, I am not prepared to strike out the appellant’s appeal. However, if the sugar content is less than 10%, then it is my decision that the decision by HMRC to allocate commodity code 17 02 90 50 00 is entirely correct. And the appellant’s prospects of succeeding in its appeal are fanciful. And so the appeal should be struck out.
We cannot move forward unless and until a chemical analysis has been undertaken on the maltodextrin which was imported and which is the subject matter of this appeal. I am assuming that the product which is the subject matter of this appeal is still available for chemical analysis.
So, the fairest thing to do is to adopt a wait-and-see approach. I shall strike out the appeal but that will only apply in 60 days’ time. If, within that time, the appellant can provide a chemical analysis of the product which was imported and which is the subject matter of this appeal, which demonstrates that its sugar content is less than 10%, then the strike out will not apply and the matter should proceed to trial.
DECISION AND DIRECTIONS
It is my decision that the tribunal has jurisdiction to consider the appeal.
I Direct that this appeal shall be struck out on a date falling 60 days after the date of release of this decision unless, before that date, the appellant provides to HMRC, prima facie evidence by way of a chemical analysis from an independent expert, that the goods which are the subject matter of this appeal had a sugar content (DE) not exceeding 10%.
Either party may apply for the foregoing Direction to be amended, suspended or set aside or for further Directions.

APPENDIX
STRIKE OUT
The F-tT Rules
1. The relevant Tribunal Procedure (First-tier Tribunal) (Tax Chamber) Rules 2009 (the “Rules”) are Rules 2 and 8:
Rule 2(3) requires us to give effect to the over-riding objective when exercising any power under the Rules. The overriding objective, as set out in Rule 2(1), is as follows:
“The overriding objective of these Rules is to enable the Tribunal to deal with cases fairly and justly”.
Rule 8 deals with strike out:
“8. Striking out a party’s case
(1) …
(2) The Tribunal must strike out the whole or a part of the proceedings if the Tribunal—
(a) does not have jurisdiction in relation to the proceedings or that part of them;…
(3) The Tribunal may strike out the whole or a part of the proceedings if—
(a) the appellant has failed to comply with a direction which stated that failure by the appellant to comply with the direction could lead to the striking out of the proceedings or part of them;
(b) the appellant has failed to co-operate with the Tribunal to such an extent that the Tribunal cannot deal with the proceedings fairly and justly; or
(c) the Tribunal considers there is no reasonable prospect of the appellant’s case, or part of it, succeeding.
(4) The Tribunal may not strike out the whole or a part of the proceedings under paragraphs (2) or (3)(b) or (c) without first giving the appellant an opportunity to make representations in relation to the proposed striking out…”.
Case law
2. The legal principles which we must consider have been neatly set out in the Upper Tribunal in The First De Sales Limited Partnership and others v HMRC [2018] UKUT 396:
“Approach to applications to strike out - legal principles
31 At [30] of the decision, the judge applied the summary of principles set out by the Upper Tribunal in HMRC v Fairford Group plc [2014] UKUT 329; [2015] STC 156 (‘Fairford Group plc’).  The Upper Tribunal held (at [41]) that:
“In our judgment an application to strike out in the FTT under r 8(3)(c) should be considered in a similar way to an application under CPR 3.4 in civil proceedings (whilst recognising that there is no equivalent jurisdiction in the FTT Rules to summary judgment under Pt 24).   The tribunal must consider whether there is a realistic, as opposed to a fanciful (in the sense of it being entirely without substance), prospect of succeeding on the issue at a full hearing, see Swain v Hillman [2001] 1 All ER 91 and Three Rivers [2000] 3 All ER 1 at [95], [2003] 2 AC 1 per Lord Hope of Craighead.  A ‘realistic’ prospect of success is one that carries some degree of conviction and not one that is merely arguable, see ED & F Man Liquid ProductsLtd v Patel [2003] EWCA Civ 472, [2003] 24 LS Gaz R 37. The tribunal must avoid conducting a ‘mini-trial’.  As Lord Hope observed in Three Rivers, the strike-out procedure is to deal with cases that are not fit for a full hearing at all”.
32. It was common ground that the application should be considered in a similar way to an application under CPR 3.4 in civil proceedings (whilst recognising that there is no equivalent jurisdiction in the FTT Rules to summary judgment under Part 24).
33. Although the summary in Fairford Group Plc is very helpful, we prefer to apply the more detailed statement of principles in respect of application for summary judgment set out by Lewison J, as he then was, in Easyair Ltd (t/a Openair) v Opal Telecom Ltd [2009] EWHC 339 (Ch) at [15]. This was subsequently approved by the Court of Appeal in AC Ward & Sons v Caitlin Five Limited [2009] EWCA Civ 1098.  The parties to this appeal did not suggest that any of these principles were inapplicable to strike out applications.
“i) The court must consider whether the claimant has a ‘realistic’ as opposed to a fanciful prospect of success: Swain v Hillman [2001] 1 All ER 9;
ii) A ‘realistic’ claim is one that carries some degree of conviction. This means a claim that is more than merely arguable: ED & F Man Liquid Products v Patel [2003] EWCA Civ 472 at [8];
iii) In reaching its conclusion the court must not conduct a ‘mini-trial’: Swain vHillman;
iv) This does not mean that the court must take at face value and without analysis everything that a claimant says in his statements before the court. In some cases it may be clear that there is no real substance in factual assertions made, particularly if contradicted by contemporaneous documents: ED & F Man Liquid Products v Patel at [10];
v) However, in reaching its conclusion the court must take into account not only the evidence actually placed before it on the application for summary judgment, but also the evidence that can reasonably be expected to be available at trial: Royal Brompton Hospital NHS Trust v Hammond (No 5) [2001] EWCA Civ 550;
vi) Although a case may turn out at trial not to be really complicated, it does not follow that it should be decided without the fuller investigation into the facts at trial than is possible or permissible on summary judgment. Thus the court should hesitate about making a final decision without a trial, even where there is no obvious conflict of fact at the time of the application, where reasonable grounds exist for believing that a fuller investigation into the facts of the case would add to or alter the evidence available to a trial judge and so affect the outcome of the case: Doncaster Pharmaceuticals Group Ltd v Bolton Pharmaceutical Co 100 Ltd [2007] FSR 63;
vii) On the other hand it is not uncommon for an application under Part 24 to give rise to a short point of law or construction and, if the court is satisfied that it has before it all the evidence necessary for the proper determination of the question and that the parties have had an adequate opportunity to address it in argument, it should grasp the nettle and decide it. The reason is quite simple: if the respondent's case is bad in law, he will in truth have no real prospect of succeeding on his claim or successfully defending the claim against him, as the case may be. Similarly, if the applicant’s case is bad in law, the sooner that is determined, the better. If it is possible to show by evidence that although material in the form of documents or oral evidence that would put the documents in another light is not currently before the court, such material is likely to exist and can be expected to be available at trial, it would be wrong to give summary judgment because there would be a real, as opposed to a fanciful, prospect of success. However, it is not enough simply to argue that the case should be allowed to go to trial because something may turn up which would have a bearing on the question of construction: ICI Chemicals & Polymers Ltd v TTE Training Ltd [2007] EWCA Civ 725””.

SECOND JUDGMENT
KERRY BRETHERTON KC and SAMUEL WARITAY (instructed by way of DIRECT ACCESS) for the FIRST AND SECOND CLAIMANTS
RICHARD BOTTOMLEY  (instructed by DEBENHAMS OTTAWAY LLP) for the FIRST DEFENDANT
MOHAMMED HAFIAZ (of  LEEDS DAY) for the FIFTH DEFENDANT AND THIRTEENTH DEFENDANT
SECOND, THIRD, FOURTH AND NINTH DEFENDANTS IN PERSON
HER HONOUR JUDGE KAREN WALDEN-SMITH:
This is the second judgment after my judgment dealing with applications to recuse, transfer and adjourn this matter.  The application to adjourn was granted, the application to transfer was not granted and the application to recuse being marked as totally without merit.  As this is a short point in which typographical and grammatical errors can be forgiven I am not giving time for corrections to be made and will simply hand down at 10am on Monday 3 February 2025.  Time for any application for permission to appeal runs from that time.
The additional issue is with respect to whether there should be a CCMC relating to the consolidated claim which would include a re-visiting of the costs budgets.
As I have already set out in the first judgment, at the hearing on 3 April 2024, the two cases were consolidated together and I made an order that the 15-day hearing commence on 6 January 2025 and that there be a further costs case management hearing in June 2024, with the court to request the parties to provide dates to avoid.     For reasons I have set out in the first judgment, that trial fixture was broken and was relisted  to commence on 27 February 2025 but notice of the refixed hearing was not sent to the court until October 2024.  No steps were taken by the court to list the CCMC and no enquires were made as to the availability of the parties.    Ms Saunders set out in her fifth statement “The court administration appears to have broken down completely.”
Solicitors and counsel for the first defendant provided some proposed directions in an attempt to keep the trial but those were not agreed to by the claimants.  That attempt to provide directions to save the trial dates were unfortunately described by leading counsel for the claimants in terms that “she had never heard anything so ridiculous”.
In my judgment it was not possible to keep the trial dates due to the errors that had occurred on the part of the court with respect to listing the CCMC when it should have done, and I have therefore adjourned the matter to commence at the end of April 2025 and into May 2025.
I have already given the following directions:
The court dispenses with the obligation on the parties in the consolidated claims to re-draft their statements of case;
The consolidated claims shall comprise the Claimants and all the Defendants in both claims save for the Thirteenth Defendant whose trial shall be dealt with separately.
The trial of the consolidated claims shall be listed for 15 days commence on 29 April 2025 and to be listed through to 23 May 2025 (save for a carve-out for Counsel’s convenience);
The part of the consolidated claims involving the Thirteenth Defendant is to be dealt with at the end of the 15-day matter will be heard on 27th and 2025-May-28.
I have already given directions for disclosure and inspection of documents and have ordered that there shall be a three hour remote hearing for the court to hear further arguments in relation to their respective costs budgets.
The claimant contend that they should be entitled to have their costs budgets revisited in light of the order for the claim to be consolidated.    The first defendant contends that the issues have been determined and are therefore res judicata.
Costs
CPR rule 3 sets out the wide discretion the court has with respect to case management including cost budgeting.   Included within the court’s general powers of management in CPR r. 3.1 is the power to vary or revoke an order (CPR r.3.1(7)).
It is worth recalling that the purpose of costs management is that the court should manage both the steps to be taken and the costs incurred by the parties to any proceedings (or variation costs as provided in rule 3.15A) so as to further the overriding objective.    The requirement to file and exchange budgets and budget discussion reports falls upon all parties to multi-track claims (save for the exceptions in CPR r.3.12) , except litigants in person.   CPR r.3.13(6) provides that although a litigant in person is not required to prepare a budget each other party, each other party (other than a litigant in person,) must provide a litigant in person with a copy of that party’s budget.
The power to order a litigant in person to file and exchange costs budgets is contained in CPR r. 3.13(3)(a): “the court may, on its initiative or application order the parties …”.   CPR r. 3.13(3)(b) makes it mandatory to file and exchange costs budgets if all parties consent to an application for such an order for costs.   The defendants sought such an order, the second claimant (acting on behalf of herself and the first claimant) did not object to such an order.   I did not take that as being an application consented to by all parties (although it strikes me that it could have been viewed in that way) but a matter where I needed to consider the exercise of my discretion.
Given the sums that she appears to be willing to pay counsel, I do not understand that Ms Saunders is without the means to instruct solicitors if she wished to.   I understand that she was qualified as a solicitor and that she would have had a practising certificate at some point.   By deciding to act as a litigant in person and represent the first claimant, of which she is a director, neither claimants nor the defendants nor the court obtain the benefit of a practising solicitor being engaged with the dispassion and skills that would involve.
While deciding not to instruct solicitors, the second claimant has decided to instruct counsel by way of direct access to act on her behalf, which I am told includes junior counsel dealing with the preparatory work.   Counsel instructed by Ms Saunders are senior junior counsel (1993 call), who specialises in property matters, and leading counsel (1992 call, 2016 KC), who is also specialist property counsel.  Neither counsel are licensed to carry out litigation and I understand that Ms Saunders instructs them as and when she decides to.   Plainly that is a matter for her, but the fees being charged by counsel when it was 12-day trial (even if including preparatory work by junior counsel

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  ), namely £357,600 out of a total sum of £377,899 for the whole litigation, plainly needed to be budgeted by the court.  That was in order to fulfil the overriding objective and so that the costs, for the work being carried out by legal professionals, is budgeted in a way that is reasonable and proportionate.
The costs budgeting process means that the court may manage the costs to be incurred by any party in any proceedings (CPR r 3.15(1)) and make a costs management order (CPR r 3.15(2)) which, with respect to the budgeted costs which are not agreed, record the court’s approval after making appropriate revisions (CPR r  3.15(2)(b)).       Importantly, CPR r 3.15(8) sets out that a costs management order concerns the totals allowed for each phase of the budget, and while the underlying detail in the budget for each phase used by the party to calculate the total claimed is provided for reference purposes to assist the court in fixing a budget, it is not the role of the court in the costs management hearing to fix or approve the hourly rates claimed in the budget.    Putting the matter briefly, the court’s role is to assess whether the costs claimed – whether by way of time costs or disbursements – is reasonable and proportionate with respect to the work being carried out.  It is not so simple as saying that a certain figure is appropriate for a particular phase.  The court considers what work is being carried out in that phase and whether that work is reasonable and proportionate taking into account matters such as the complexity and value of the issues in dispute.   Nothing prohibits a party from instructing whoever they may wish.     Costs budgeting simply protects the paying party from potential excesses on the part of the successful party.
Having determined that it was appropriate to consolidate the proceedings I do consider that the costs budgets should be reconsidered as that is a significant development in accordance with the provisions of CPR 3.15A.
I have listed a three hour hearing for costs budgeting on 17 February 2025.     At that hearing the parties can address me with respect to any issues relating to which costs should be permitted, so long as they abide by the order I make with respect to budgets.   I may come to the same conclusions as before, or different conclusions.
In order that parties are not taken by surprise with respect to the costs that are to be budgeted, I am making an order that:
The first defendant and the fifth and thirteenth defendants are to provide to the court and to the other parties updated and revised schedule H reports by no later than 4pm on 10 February 2025.   The claimants are to provide to the court and to the other parties summary costs reports setting out the phases of work, as set out in a Schedule H, and including details of disbursements and litigant in person costs.
The claimants, the first defendant and the fifth and thirteenth defendants are to provide completed budget discussion reports in Precedent R by no later than 4pm on 13 February 2025.
The claimant is to provide a bundle of documents  containing the updated and revised Schedule H reports and summary and Precedent Rs for the use of the court by 9am on 17 February 2025.
As all the parties have shown themselves willing and able to deal with matters in this case by using email, and given the previous difficulties with service, I direct that service is to take place by the documents being sent by email.

INFORMATION COMMISSIONER
Respondent
Representation:
For the Appellant: in person
For the Respondent: did not appear
Decision: The appeal is Dismissed.
The Council is entitled to refuse to provide the information requested by the Appellant on 24 May 2022 on the basis that the request is manifestlyunreasonable pursuant to Regulation 12(4)(b) of the EnvironmentalInformationRegulations.
REASONS
Context
The history of the relationship between the parties is important in this case in that it forms the backdrop of this appeal and adds context to the Tribunal’s decision.
In December 2020, Kent County Council removed a tree from the verge at the front of the Appellant’s property.
The removal of the tree formed part of a larger project to trim and remove other vegetation along the verge which was obstructing the sight line of the adjacent road.
Initially, the tree was not due to be removed, despite the Appellant requesting the Council to include the tree within the vegetation removal. However, despite the initial refusal at the request of the Appellant, the Council did decide to also remove the tree and works to do so took place on 20 December 2020.
Unfortunately, the removal of the tree caused damage to the Appellant’s property by way of damaged roof tiles after the tree landed upon the Appellant’s property.
The Appellant exhausted the complaints procedures with Kent County Council in relation to this damage and the matter was escalated to the Local Government Ombudsman (‘LGO’). The LGO found that there were no grounds for further investigation and that the Appellant’s complaint would not be investigated as it was unlikely the LGO could achieve anything for the Appellant by doing so. The LGO recommended that any claim for compensation be resolved via the civil courts.
The Appellant commenced legal proceedings against the Council and the matter was ultimately resolved by way of a monetary settlement paid by the Council.
Background to Appeal
This Appeal dated 8 July 2024 and made by Mr Kenneth Reaveley (the “Appellant”) arises following a request for information (the “Request”) made by the Appellant to Kent County Council (“the Council”) on 6 September 2023 in the following terms:
“I would like copies of all KCC Highways Internal & External emails, letters, Meetings & Telephone calls over Verge / Tree on Staplestreet Road fronting Lavender Cottage leading up to and covering the following dates:-
13-07-2020, 23-09-2020, 01-10-2020, 17-11-2020, 27-11-2020, 30-11-2020, 02-12-2020, 03-12-2030, 08-12- 2020, 10- 12-2020 11-12-2020, 14-12-2020, 18-12-2020, 11-01-2021 & 18-01-2021.”
The Council responded to the request on 4 October 2023 and refused to provide the requested information on the basis that the request was ‘manifestly unreasonable pursuant to Regulation 12(4)(b) of the Environmental Information Regulations 2004. The council’ response stated that:
“Kent County Council (KCC/the Council) has determined that this request is fully exempt from disclosure. This is because we have determined that the Regulation 12(4)(b) exception applies. Please see Appendix below for further details of this exception. While KCC does hold information relevant to your request, we have determined that it is exempt from disclosure in full. This is because responding to your request would be manifestly unreasonable.
In coming to this conclusion, the Council considered the history of interactions
associated with this issue since July 2020, the burden associated with managing these communications, and the resolutions that have been affected to date.
The Council recognises that the matter in question has already been fully and
conclusively settled through both a referral to the Local Government Ombudsman and a claims process.
The Regulation 12(4)(b) exception is subject to a Public Interest Test. The Council has weighed the above factors against the general presumption in favour of disclosure for environmental information. We have concluded that while you may have some significant private interest disclosure, there is relatively little wider public interest.
Due to this, we have concluded that the overall Public Interest favours withholding the data and have gone on to apply the exception to your case.”
Dissatisfied with the response of the Council, the Appellant requested an internal review of the decision and submitted to the Council a 126-page document in support of his arguments as to why the Council should provide the requested information.
The Council responded to Appellant’s request for an internal review of the decision on 28 February 2024. The Council apologised to the Appellant for the delay in his receiving the outcome of the internal review, which was the result of an administrative error within the Council.
The Council confirmed to the Appellant that the internal review had been undertaken, and that the Council was correct to refuse the request as it was manifestly unreasonable. The outcome response included the following:
“In this case the Council has taken account of the wider context associated with your
request in coming to the conclusion that it is manifestly unreasonable. This is because
January 2020.
The Council has already corresponded extensively with you regarding this matter since
This includes dozens of emails across multiple teams and officers, Freedom of Information / Environmental Information requests, a Stage 1 and 2 corporate complaint, a referral to the Local Government Ombudsman and legal proceedings which were settled out of court.
...
Continuing to engage with you on this issue would represent a disproportionate
diversion of the Council's resources. There is no further reasonable resolution that can
be achieved by revisiting the issue, and no indication that responding to this request
would resolve the matter to your satisfaction. Conversely, it is likely to generate further correspondence and requests that would further compound the associated burden on resources.
The manner of extensive correspondence is further demonstrated by your internal
review submission, which is 126 pages long. Reviewing this document has taken an
extensive amount of officer time, with very little of the submitted content appearing to
be directly materially relevant to the Environmental Information request the review
relates to.
On this basis, the Council considers that the matter has been thoroughly and
conclusively resolved. The information request appears to be an attempt to reopen a
closed matter and relitigate issues that have already been exhaustively explored over a
protracted period of time.

Reasons for Commissioner’s Decision
The matter was referred to the Information Commissioner's Office by the Appellant on 25 January 2024 and following some further information, in a decision notice (the “Decision Notice”) dated 13 June 2024, the Information Commissioner (“IC”) held that:
“The Commissioner’s decision is that the Council is entitled to rely on regulation 12(4)(b) to refuse to comply with the request.
However, he also finds that the Council breached regulation 11 (reconsideration) of the EIR by failing to provide the complainant with the outcome of its internal review within 40 working days”
In summary, The Commissioner’s reasons for the Decision were that there had been a large volume of correspondence sent to the Council by the Appellant which has taken the Council several hundred hours to respond to and accordingly has placed a significant burden on the Council limiting its time spent on performing other duties. The Commissioner noted that the vast majority of the content of the correspondence sent to the Council concerned the damage to the Appellant’s property and not the request for information, and the Commissioner accepted that the Appellant was using the request for information as a way to reopen the complaint. The Commissioner considered that the request lacked serious purpose and value and that compliance with the request would not resolve the Appellant’s concerns and would result in further correspondence being sent to the council and thus increasing the burden.
The Commissioner recognised that the requested information is of interest to the Appellant, however, he did not consider that there was any interest to the wider public and in any event, it is not in the public interest for the Council to divert further resources in dealing with the Appellant’s request.
Whilst the IC Decision acknowledges that the Council were in breach of regulation 11 (reconsideration) of the EIR by failing to provide the complainant with the outcome of its internal review within 40 working days, the Commissioner did not require any further steps to be taken by the Council.
Appeal and Responses
This appeal relates to the application of the Environmental Information Regulations 2004.
The Appellant appealed the Decision Notice on the following grounds:
The Council is burying information surrounding the incident as the incident was engineered to look like an accident;
It is not the Appellant who is manifestly unreasonable, but the Council and IC are manifestly unreasonable in their dealings with the Appellant;
The Appellant has a right to know whether the tree being dropped on his house was a genuine accident or a deliberate act engineered to look like an accident;
The Commissioner’s response to the appeal maintains that the Decision Notices are correct and that in all the circumstances, the request was manifestly unreasonable further to the case law set out by the Court of Appeal in Dransfield v Information Commissioner & Devon County Council [2015] EWCA Civ 454 (which did not depart from the UT findings in Information Commissioner v Dransfield [2012] UKUT 440 (AAC)) and Craven v Information Commissioner and DECC [2015] EWCA Civ 454. It is the Commissioner’s view that the balance of the public interest favours the maintenance of the exception, rather than being equally balanced and that the exception provided by regulation 12(4)(b) was applied correctly. Therefore, the Council is not required to disclose the requested information.
Documents
The Tribunal was provided with and took account of a 438-page bundle.
Applicable Law
Regulation 2(1) of the Environmental Information Regulations (“EIR”) defines “environmentalinformation” as:
“…any information in written, visual, aural, electronic or any other material form     on -
the state of the elements of the environment, such as air and atmosphere,   water, soil, land, landscape and natural sites including wetlands, coastal   and marine areas, biological diversity and its components... and     interaction among these elements;
….
measures (including administrative measures), such as policies, legislation,   plans, programmes, environmental agreements and activities affecting or   likely to affect the elements and factors referred to in (a) and (b) as well as    measures or activities designed to protect those elements;
…
the state of human health and safety, including the contamination of the   food chain, where relevant, conditions of human life, cultural sites and   built structures inasmuch  as they are or may be affected by the state of the   elements of the environment referred to in (a) or, through those elements,   by any of the matters referred to in (b) and (c);
It was not disputed by the parties that the information requested in the Request was “environmentalinformation” as defined in Regulation 2(1) and that the Request is therefore subject to the EIR and not the Freedom of Information Act 2000 (although the Appellant often referred to “FOIA” his submissions).
Regulation 5 EIR provides:
Subject to paragraph (3) and in accordance with paragraphs (2), (4), (5) and (6) and the remaining provisions of this Part and Part 3 of these Regulations, a public authority that  holds environmentalinformation shall make it available on request.”
Regulation 12(1) EIR provides:
Subject to paragraphs (2), (3) and (9), a public authority may refuse to disclose environmentalinformation requested if—
an exception to disclosure applies under paragraphs (4) or (5); and
in all the circumstances of the case, the public interest in maintaining  the exception outweighs the public interest in disclosing the  information.”
Regulation 12(2) provides that: “A public authority shall apply a presumption  in favour of disclosure.”
Regulation 12(4) provides that:
“For the purposes of paragraph (1)(a), a public authority may refuse to disclose information to the extent that—
…
the request for information is manifestly unreasonable;”
In Craven v Information Commissioner and DECC [2012] UKUT 442 (AAC), the Upper Tribunal stated that:
“in deciding whether a request is “manifestlyunreasonable” under the EIR, a tribunal should have regard to the same types of considerations as apply to the determination of whether a request is “vexatious” under FOIA” [paragraph 30]
The relevant provisions of FOIA are as follows:
Vexatious or repeated requests.
Section 1(1) does not oblige a public authority to comply with a request for information if the request is vexatious.
Where a public authority has previously complied with a request for information which was made by any person, it is not obliged to comply with a subsequent identical or substantially similar request from that person unless a reasonable interval has elapsed between compliance with the previous request and the making of the current request.
Determination of appeals.
If on an appeal under section 57 the Tribunal considers—
that the notice against which the appeal is brought is not in accordance with the law, or
to the extent that the notice involved an exercise of discretion by the Commissioner, that he ought to have exercised his discretion differently,
the Tribunal shall allow the appeal or substitute such other notice as could have been served by the Commissioner; and in any other case the Tribunal shall dismiss the appeal.
On such an appeal, the Tribunal may review any finding of fact on which the notice in question was based
There is no further guidance on the meaning of “vexatious” in the legislation. The leading guidance is contained in the Upper Tribunal (“UT”) decision in Information Commissioner v Dransfield [2012] UKUT 440 (AAC), as upheld and clarified in the Court of Appeal (“CA”) in Dransfield v Information Commissioner and another & Craven v Information Commissioner and another [2015] EWCA Civ 454 (CA).
As noted by Arden LJ in her judgment in the CA in Dransfield, the hurdle of showing a request is vexatious is a high one: “…the starting point is that vexatiousness primarily involves making a request which has no reasonable foundation, that is, no reasonable foundation for thinking that the information sought would be of value to the requester, or to the public or any section of the public. Parliament has chosen a strong word which therefore means that the hurdle of satisfying it is a high one, and that is consistent with the constitutional nature of the right. The decision maker should consider all the relevant circumstances in order to reach a balanced conclusion as to whether a request is vexatious.” (para 68).
Judge Wikeley’s decision in the UT Dransfield sets out more detailed guidance that was not challenged in the Court of Appeal. The ultimate question is, “is the request vexatious in the sense of being a manifestly unjustified, inappropriate or improper use of FOIA?” (para 43). It is important to adopt a “holistic and broad” approach, emphasising “manifest unreasonableness, irresponsibility and, especially where there is a previous course of dealings, the lack of proportionality that typically characterise vexatious requests.” (para 45). Arden LJ in the CA also emphasised that a “rounded approach” is required (para 69), and all evidence which may shed light on whether a request is vexatious should be considered.
The UT set out four non-exhaustive broad issues which can be helpful in assessing whether a request is vexatious:
The burden imposed on the public authority by the request. This may be inextricably linked with the previous course of dealings between the parties. “…the context and history of the previous request, in terms of the previous course of dealings between the individual requester and the public authority in question, must be considered in assessing whether it is properly to be characterised as vexatious. In particular, the number, breadth, pattern and duration of previous requests may be a telling factor.” (para 29).
The motive of the requester. Although FOIA is motive-blind, “what may seem like an entirely reasonable and benign request may be found to be vexatious in the wider context of the course of dealings between the individual and the relevant public authority.” (para 34).
The value or serious purpose. Lack of objective value cannot provide a basis for refusal on its own, but is part of the balancing exercise – “does the request have a value or serious purpose in terms of the objective public interest in the information sought?” (para 38).
Any harassment of, or distress caused to, the public authority’s staff. This is not necessary in order for a request to be vexatious, but “vexatiousness may be evidenced by obsessive conduct that harasses or distresses staff, uses intemperate language, makes wide-ranging and unsubstantiated allegations of criminal behaviour or is in any other respects extremely offensive.” (para 39). 23. Overall, the purpose of section 14 is to “protect the resources (in the broadest sense of that word) of the public authority from being squandered on disproportionate use of FOIA” (UT para 10), subject always to the high standard of vexatiousness being met.
Discussion and Conclusions
In accordance with section 58 FOIA, the issue for the Tribunal to decide upon is whether the IC’s Decision Notice was in accordance with the law and whether the IC was correct in finding that the Council was entitled to rely on Regulation 12(4)(b) of the EIR in refusing to provide the requested information.
Under section 58(2) FOIA, the Tribunal can review any finding of fact upon which the Decision Notice was based, consider all of the evidence before it and reach its own decision.
The Tribunal has considered the suggested list of factors set out in the Dransfield case and the overall circumstances of the case, including the history of the relationship between the parties.
The burden imposed on the public authority by the request.This is a key factor relied upon by the Council. Whilst the Tribunal accepts that just because a request is burdensome, this does not absolve the Council from their legal obligations under the EIR, there has been an extremely large volume of documentation sent by the Appellant to the Council, emails, letters of complaint and a large number of responses from the Council to the Appellant already made.
The Council says that to deal with the request would take more than 18 hours but that the Council has already spent several hundred hours in dealing with the Appellant’s previous correspondences. The Tribunal has considered the aggregated burden of dealing with the volume of the correspondences accepts that this would have placed a significant burden upon the Council and detracted from the available time to be spent on other matters. The Tribunal considered that responding to the request would likely be a gateway to further requests from the Appellant in future which would only add to the burden placed upon the Council.
The motive of the requestor. It is generally the case that the application of the EIR or FOIA and any request made under them is not dependent on the motive behind the request. However, Regulation 12 (and section 14) is an exception to this principle. The motive of the requestor can be an important factor as to whether a request is manifestly unreasonable/vexatious in the wider context of the dealings between an individual and a public authority. In this case, the Appellant says that his motive for making the request is to ‘get to the truth’ and uncover the information behind, what he says, is a deliberate act by the Council of having a tree land upon his property. However, the history of the dispute between the Appellant and the Council suggests that the request for information and the motivation for making the request are being used as part of a campaign to question and undermine the Council. The Appellant has received large amounts of information surrounding the incident involving the tree removal and indeed has exhausted the Council’s complaints process, the complaints process with the Local Government Ombudsman and has received compensatory damages in relation to the dispute following action taken in the civil courts. The Tribunal finds that the motive of the Appellant in making the request for information and the subsequent complaint to the IC and this appeal is to revisit a complaint which has already been more than adequately dealt with and to undermine the Council and public bodies generally by attempting to expose perceived wrongdoing, of which there is no evidence in this case.
It is noted by the Tribunal that the Appellant has compared the current request for information and the surrounding issues to the tragic events which took place at Hillsborough in 1989 and Aberfan in 1996 and the recent scandal involving the Post Office and the Horizon IT system. It is the Tribunal’s view that the subject of this appeal and the disasters and scandals referenced by the Appellant are simply not comparable. The injustices suffered by the Appellant and those affected by Hillsborough, Aberfan and the Horizon IT scandal are significantly incomparable. It is fair to characterise the request and related correspondence as both obsessive and disproportionate.
Value or serious purpose.The Tribunal considers that the information is trivial, in that the requested information holds no practical value given that the Appellant has already received a satisfactory outcome by way of compensatory damages. He has lodged his complaint with the Council and the complaint has been investigated and adequately dealt with. The Appellant will gain no further benefit by obtaining the requested information. Indeed, it should be noted that it was the Appellant’s wish that the tree be removed from the vegetative area at the front of his property as part of the planned removal of other vegetation by the Council. Whilst the Council initially refused this request, ultimately, the Appellant achieved his desired outcome in having the tree removed. The Appellant now takes issue with this decision to remove the tree.  Accordingly, the Tribunal considers that the Appellant’s request of 6 September 2023 is a positional ploy to build upon the acrimonious exchanges which have already taken place between the Appellant and the Council, which is at odds with the underlying principles of the legislation. The information requested holds no practical value.
Any harassment of, or distressed caused to, the public authority’s staff.The Tribunal does not find that the Appellant has harassed any particular individual working in the Council, nor has he used the extreme types of language and behaviour referred to in the Dransfield test. However, the Tribunal does accept that the volume of correspondences, complaints and requests for information would have caused some distress to those dealing with them.
The overall circumstances of the case. As set out in the Dransfield test, the Tribunal is to take a rounded and holistic approach when considering whether the IC was correct in finding that the Council was entitled to rely on Regulation 12(4)(b) of the EIR.
Having considered all of the circumstances, the Tribunal finds the Appellant’s request of 6 September 2023 is manifestly unreasonable. The Appellant had already received a satisfactory outcome to his complaint and received large volumes of information surrounding the same.  Whilst the Appellant believes his requests are in the public interest and the Tribunal accepts that the Appellant has a strong private interest in the information, this request appears to form part of a wider campaign to undermine the Council and cause a significant diversion from its main work. The Tribunal finds that this is not in the public interest and the interest in maintaining the exception is not outweighed by the public interest in the release of the information.
Reg 12(2) EIR provides that a presumption in favour of disclosure is applied when considering whether any exceptions apply. In Vesco v Information Commissioner and the Government Legal Department ([2019] UKUT 247 (AAC) 1 August 2019) the Upper Tribunal took the approach that the presumption in favour of disclosure is to be considered as part of the process of engaging an exception and considering the public interest test. In this case, it is the Tribunal’s view that the balance weighs authoritatively in favour of non-disclosure, and for that reason the presumption in favour of disclosure does not make any substantial difference.
The Tribunal has taken into account the underlying purpose of Regulation 12(4)(b) of the EIR and section 14 FOIA in this case, to protect the limited resources of the  Council and accordingly finds that the Council was entitled to rely on Regulation 12(4)(b) of the EIR to refuse to reply to the request of 6 September 2023.
The Tribunal dismisses the appeal for the reasons given above.

Before:
Mr Justice Harrison
(In Private)
Re C (A Child) (Recognition of Nigerian Adoption)
Mr Richard Thompson (instructed by K&S@Law solicitors) appeared on behalf of the applicants
Mr Thomas Jones (instructed by the Treasury Solicitor) appeared on behalf of the Secretary of State for the Home Department
Hearing date: 24 January 2025
Mr Justice Harrison:
Introduction
I am concerned with a little girl to whom I will refer as C. She was born in Nigeria in 2017 and is now aged 7. The applicants, to whom I shall refer individually as ‘the mother’ and ‘the father’, adopted C in Nigeria in 2018. They now ask the English court to recognise that adoption.
The applicants have been represented by Mr Richard Thompson. On 29 October 2024 an order was made for the proceedings to be served on the Secretary of State for the Home Department (‘SSHD’) to enable her to consider whether to participate. She took up that invitation and has been represented before me by Mr Thomas Jones. I am grateful to all parties, but especially to Mr Jones for providing the court with a comprehensive and helpful skeleton argument, in which he has presented the law in neutral terms, together with an accompanying bundle of authorities.
I heard oral evidence on 24 January 2024 from the mother and from the father, each of whom was cross-examined by Mr Jones. Having listened carefully to the evidence I came to the conclusion that both applicants were patently honest witnesses, doing their best to assist the court. I accept their evidence.
At the conclusion of the evidence I received brief closing submissions from Mr Jones and Mr Thompson. Mr Jones made it clear that the SSHD adopts a neutral stance in relation to the application. After hearing submissions I reserved judgment.
C has not been made a party to the proceedings. It would in my view have been preferable for her to be a party so that her standpoint could be considered independently. I have considered whether I should now take steps to enable this to happen, but have decided not adopt such a course. The process of joining C and appointing a Cafcass guardian would result in significant delay. C’s childhood to date has already been blighted by delay in the legal system. There are ongoing proceedings before the Upper Tribunal which have been adjourned to await this court’s decision on recognition.  Those proceedings are listed for hearing on 3 February 2025 and would have to be further adjourned if I was unable to conclude this application before then. Ultimately, I consider that an adjournment would be contrary to the overriding objective. I have considerable information before me about C’s circumstances. As I will explain below, I have decided that her Nigerian adoption should be recognised. Based upon the evidence of the mother and the father (which I accept) I am entirely satisfied that the outcome I propose accords with her wishes, her primary wish in this context being to be able to join her mother and father in England and live a normal family life with them.
Background
The mother was born in Nigeria and is now aged 56. She holds dual Nigerian and British nationality (the latter was acquired in 2019). She was previously married and divorced and has no children from that marriage. She is a qualified nurse. She first entered the United Kingdom in 2005 as a student nurse. Following an appeal she was granted a work permit in 2009. At the time of grant she had, however, left the United Kingdom. In March 2009 she obtained entry clearance to re-enter the United Kingdom as the holder of a work permit until 2014. In March 2014 she was granted indefinite leave to remain and thereafter (as recorded above) she obtained British citizenship. I understand that she is not currently working. I have seen a letter from her general practitioner which sets out that she has a number of health conditions.
The father was also born in Nigeria and originates from Imo State. He is aged 52. He has Nigerian nationality. In July 2016 he applied for entry clearance as a spouse of the mother, which was granted in October 2016. In 2019 he was granted an extension of his stay. In November 2024 he was granted indefinite leave to remain in the United Kingdom. He said in evidence (and I accept) that he intends to apply for British citizenship. He is a support worker, assisting the elderly in independent living.
The father had a previous relationship, from which he has two children, D and L. Sadly, these children’s mother died soon after the birth of the younger child, L. D is a university student. L has completed school and intends also to go to university.  Both of these children presently live in Nigeria.
The applicants first met in 2013.  At the time the mother was living in England and the father in Nigeria. They married in Nigeria at the end of 2014, later renewing their vows at an Anglican church in England. During the early part of the marriage the mother and the father were living in separate jurisdictions: she in England and he in Nigeria. As I have already recorded, the father applied for and was eventually granted entry clearance to join his wife in the United Kingdom.
The applicants’ marriage led to them having discussions about adopting a child. The mother’s evidence, which I accept, was that she was keen for the two of them to have a child together to cement their union. She was unable give birth to a child and so adoption was the chosen route.
The applicants started exploring the potential to adopt a child in Nigeria in 2016. At that time the father remained living in that jurisdiction. From the documents I have seen, it appears that they made an application to the relevant authority in Imo State, Nigeria (the Ministry of Women and Vulnerable Group Affairs (‘the Ministry’)) and also directly to an orphanage called Love Care Child Centre (‘LCCC’); the latter application is recorded by LCCC as having been made on 25 February 2016.
After submitting the adoption application, the father received the spousal visa for which he had applied and was able to join the mother in England. He did so on 28 October 2016.  Since that time, the applicants have lived together in Bournemouth.
C was born in May 2017 to her 19 year old birth mother (‘BM’) in Imo State. Soon after her birth, BM came to a decision that she was unable to care for her and delivered her to the care of LCCC. The information I have about BM is limited. She is reported by LCCC to have been a ‘student’ who was unable to care for the child as a result of being ‘unemployed’. C’s birth father (‘BF’) abandoned BM following C’s conception.  Attempts by LCCC to contact him following the birth proved abortive.
A letter dated 26 April 2021 from Mr Onyinye of the Ministry records that BM gave her ‘consent’ 11 days after C’s birth (I have not seen the letter of consent but it is referred to as being attached to a letter dated 15 May 2017 from LCCC to the Ministry; I assume that it is a form of consent to C being placed in the care of the orphanage as opposed to a consent to adoption in view of the content of the Home Study and Investigation report to which I refer below). A second letter from Mr Onyinye records that C was willingly handed over to LCCC.  The orphanage reported the matter to the Ministry and thereafter came to a decision that it was in C’s best interests to be ‘given up for adoption’.
On 7 November 2017 LCCC wrote to the Ministry seeking authority to place C with the applicants, allowing them to ‘legally foster’ C. Approval was given by the Ministry on 14 November 2017. I have seen a certificate from LCCC recording that C started living with the applicants on 16 November 2017. That same day an order was made by the Chief Magistrate at the Family Court of Imo State of Nigeria authorising this placement with them. The order also directed the ‘Child Development Officer’ to conduct periodic checks at the applicants’ home in Imo State and assess their suitability for an adoption order. The proceedings were listed for a return date in February 2018. Despite what is recorded in this order, it is the mother’s evidence that the parties were each living and working in England at the time and therefore not in a position to remain living continuously with C in Nigeria for a period of three months, which is a standard requirement (unless it is waived) before an adoption order can be made in Nigeria.
On 19 November 2017 C was Christened in an Anglican church in the father’s hometown in Nigeria.
By virtue of an order made by the same Chief Magistrate in February 2018 C was formally adopted by the applicants. The respondents to the proceedings by which she was adopted were LCCC and the Child Development Officer. The order records that the applicants were represented by counsel. Consistent with the mother’s evidence, the order also waives the requirement for the applicants to have fostered the child for three consecutive months. The order contains a provision whereby the adopters reserve the right to travel with C to their place of residence in ‘the United State of America’. This must be a typographical error.
The court was provided with a ‘Home Study and Investigation’ report from the Chief Development Officer. The report contains a positive recommendation that it is in C’s best interests to be adopted by the applicants. I record that all necessary consents ‘were accessed’ save that of BM ‘because she was at large’.
C’s birth certificate, which is dated 13 March 2018, records the applicants as being her parents. Mr Onyinye explains that it is typically the case in Nigeria that children who are placed for adoption are not issued with an original birth certificate; the reason for this is that birth mothers often consider the birth to be ‘stigmatizing’ and wish to avoid being formally linked with the baby. This appears to have been the case here.
Mr Onyinye summarises the adoption process in his letter as follows:
‘That the child was duly and properly adopted by the adoptive parents, who went through the process as stipulated by the State as guided by The Child Rights Law. The process started at the Ministry with an application and ended at the Family Court in the State with the Suit Number [Number provided] and an Adoption order dated February, 2018. The required interface between the Motherless Babies Home, the Ministry, the adoptive parents and the family court were duly observed to birth this adoption (sic).’
Since her adoption, C has been mainly cared for in Nigeria by a series of professional nannies engaged by the applicants. A nanny was first employed in 2016 to look after the father’s older children after he relocated from Nigeria to England. C and the older children were brought up together and lived in a rental apartment in Anambra State. In 2019, D moved out to go to university; C and L continued to live with a nanny. More recently, I understand that C and L have been cared for by a family friend.
C suffers from poor health. As recorded in the judgment of the First-tier Tribunal (see below) she has had bronchial asthma for a number of years and has been diagnosed with sleep apnoea and adenoid hypertrophy. She has had surgery for these conditions; the mother’s oral evidence was that this surgery has led to a significant improvement in her health.
The parties have travelled a number of times to Nigeria to spend time with C and the two older children. The mother travelled there twice in 2018, the father accompanying her on the second trip. There was then a significant gap when they were unable to travel as a result of the mother’s poor health and the Covid pandemic. Since 2021 they have been to Nigeria at least once a year, staying there for several weeks at a time and enjoying family life with C and L (most recently in a property which they had built on land provided to them by the family).
In her oral evidence, the mother told me (and I accept) that the applicants speak to C every morning before school and again in the evening after she comes home from school.
On 15 May 2021 the applicants applied for entry clearance for C to enter the United Kingdom. This was refused on 18 August 2022 pursuant to paragraph 316A of the Immigration Rules. The basis of the refusal, amongst other things, was that the decision maker was not satisfied that ‘there has been a genuine transfer of parental responsibility’ to the applicants. Mr Jones summarised the position at paragraph 24 of his skeleton argument as follows:
‘In effect, as Nigeria is not listed within the Adoption (Recognition of Overseas Adoptions) Order 2013, and as the High Court had not recognised the adoption order, the Home Secretary could not be satisfied that there had been a genuine transfer of parental responsibility.’
C lodged an appeal against this refusal and her appeal was allowed by the First-tier Tribunal on 4 April 2023. The tribunal also considered an appeal by L against a refusal to grant entry clearance in her case and this too was allowed.
Tribunal Judge Shazia Khan found each of the applicants to be credible witnesses and gave weight to their evidence. The Judge further recorded that there was no issue as to the reliability of the documents emanating from the Ministry and the Court in Nigeria to which I have referred above and made a finding that C was lawfully adopted in Nigeria. She held that there was no evidence to suggest that this was an adoption of convenience. The Judge also held that although the day-to-day care of the children was undertaken by a nanny, the applicants retained responsibility for C and financially supported her (their involvement was corroborated by letters from C’s school and her doctor). The Judge further found that there was a strong bond between C and her half-sister L.  At paragraph 44 of the judgment, the Judge said as follows:
‘I have been concerned about the welfare of [C]. I have considered what her best interest would be. I have considered NO and KO carefully. I find that they are parents who have taken a real interest in the welfare of their children. They have ensured that the children are properly cared for using the services of a professionally nanny. I find that in this case, C’s best interest is to remain with [L] and to be reunited with her adoptive parents. I have allowed [L]’s appeal. The second Appellant is a very young child who has been abandoned by her birth parents, she suffers from health problems and will require surgery as part of her treatment. The only real family she knows are her adoptive family. I find that if [C] was separated from [L], then this would have a serious adverse impact on her welfare given the length of time she has lived with [L]. A child this young would need the support and assistance of her family to recover from any surgery. Therefore, I find the refusal of leave would have unjustifiably harsh consequences for C and test of exceptional circumstances is met.’
The Judge also made a clear finding as to the existence of ‘family life’ between the applicants and C for the purposes of Article 8 of the ECHR (a proposition not disputed before her by the SSHD). She held that the refusal of entry clearance was ‘of such a gravity as to engage article 8’. The refusal was made ‘in accordance with the law’ and was held to be ‘necessary in a democratic society’. The Judge, however, found that it was disproportionate and therefore in breach of Article 8.
The decision of the First-tier Tribunal in relation to C (but not L) was the subject of a further appeal by the SSHD to the Upper Tribunal. The appeal was allowed on 2 August 2024 by Deputy Judge Farrelly. The Judge held that the analysis conducted by the FTT had failed to give sufficient weight to the fact that the Nigerian adoption had not been recognised in the United Kingdom; this was a material error of law which meant that the decision could not stand. Judge Farrelly also saw no basis for the FTT’s conclusion that there existed ‘exceptional circumstances’, which had not been identified in the decision below, commenting that:
‘As the [SSHD] points out in the application, it was open to [the applicants] to demonstrate that the Nigerian adoption met the law applicable in the United Kingdom and met the safeguarding provisions. The judge refers to general considerations only.’
Judge Farrelly set aside the decision of the FTT and directed that the appeal (which I take to mean the applicants’ appeal against the decision to refuse C entry clearance) be listed for a de novo face-to-face hearing at the Upper Tribunal. That hearing, as I have said above, is now listed on 3 February 2025.
As is recorded by Judge Farrelly in the order made on 2 August 2024, on 6 June 2024 the Immigration Rules changed. Paragraph 316A of the rules, upon which the previous refusal to grant entry clearance was based, was deleted. The position is instead now governed by the Appendix Adoption to the Immigration Rules, to which Mr Jones drew my attention. This Appendix, as Mr Jones explained, sets out the current requirements which must be met before an adopted child can come to the United Kingdom from overseas. Two of these are set out at paragraphs AD 16.1 and 16.2.  Paragraph AD 16.5 then goes on to provide that:
‘If the requirements in AD 16.1. and AD 16.2. are not met [I interject that they are not met in this case], the adoption must have been recognised by order of the High Court in the UK.’
As a consequence of this relatively new provision, the outcome of the application before me is likely to affect the stance which the SSHD takes in respect of the extant appeal against her decision to refuse C entry clearance. Mr Jones sets out the position at paragraph 26 of his skeleton argument:
‘As confirmed in the witness evidence filed on behalf of the Secretary of State, if the High Court were to recognise the adoption, then it is likely that the appeal to the Upper Tribunal would be withdrawn given that C’s entry clearance would likely be granted by virtue of paragraph 16.5.’
Ultimately decisions about immigration are a matter solely for the SSHD (subject to the process of appeal which exists in relation to such decisions). I have to determine the application before me on its merits without regard to how my decision might influence the SSHD in relation to her own decision-making.
The law
Recognition of an overseas adoption
I gratefully adopt the comprehensive summary of the law relating to the recognition of an overseas adoption (and in particular an adoption order made in Nigeria) set out by Gwynneth Knowles J in Re G (Recognition of a Nigerian Adoption) [2024] EWHC 2769 (Fam) at paragraphs 14 to 20, which I replicate for ease of reference at paragraphs 35 to 41 below.
Pursuant to section 66(1) of the Adoption and Children Act 2002 (""ACA 2002""), the meaning of adoption includes a ""convention adoption"" (s.66(1)(c)); an ""overseas adoption"" (s.66(1)(d)); or an ""adoption recognised by the law of England and Wales and effected under the law of any other country"" (s.66(1)(e)). Nigeria is not a member state of the 1993 Hague Convention for the Protection of Children and Co-operation with respect to Intercountry Adoption (Adoption (Intercountry Aspects) Act 1999, Schedule One). Nigerian adoption orders granted prior to 3 January 2014 were designated ""overseas adoptions"". However, Nigeria is no longer included in the ""overseas adoption"" list in the Adoption (Recognition of Overseas Adoptions) Order 2013/1801. Nigerian adoptions effected after 3 January 2014 can be recognised only pursuant to s.66(1)(e) of ACA 2002 if they are recognised at common law.
Section 9(6) of ACA 2002 grants the Secretary of State for Education the power to declare that special restrictions are to apply for the time being in relation to the bringing in of children to the United Kingdom for the purpose of adoption from a particular country. Special restrictions were imposed by the Secretary of State for Education in relation to adoptions from Nigeria by the Special Restrictions on Adoptions from Abroad (Nigeria) Order 2021 (“the 2021 Order”), which came into effect on 12 March 2021. The concerns about Nigerian adoptions were summarised in the Order as follows:
difficulties confirming the background and adoptability of children;
unreliable documentation;
concerns about corruption in the Nigerian adoption system;
evidence of organised child trafficking within Nigeria;
concerns about weaknesses in the checks completed by the Nigerian authorities in relation to adoption applications from prospective adopters who were habitually resident in the United Kingdom and therefore are likely to, in fact, be intended to be intercountry adoptions. Weaknesses are identified in pre-and post-adoption monitoring procedures.
The Order states that it was made in response to significant child safeguarding concerns due to issues affecting the intercountry Nigerian adoption system. This was based on evidence received through international partners including Central Adoption Authorities and diplomatic missions.
Under the Adoptions with a Foreign Element (Special Restrictions on Adoptions from Abroad) Regulations 2008, a request can be made to treat an individual case as an exception to a special restriction imposed under ACA 2002. In deciding whether a case is exceptional, the Minister will consider all the information provided which is relevant to the individual facts and circumstances of the case. Rule 6 of the 2008 Regulations lists a number of matters which must be taken into account when exceptional cases are being considered as follows:
The circumstances leading to the child becoming available for adoption, including whether any competent authority in the State of origin has made a decision in relation to the adoption or availability for adoption of the child;
the relationship that the child has with the prospective adopters, including how and when that relationship was formed;
The child's particular needs and the capacity of the prospective adopters to meet those needs;
and the reasons why the State of origin was placed on the restricted list.
In this context, the only route through which an adoption order made in Nigeria can be recognised in this jurisdiction is under common law. The common law test for recognition of a foreign adoption was considered by Sir James Munby, the then President of the Family Division, in Re N (A Child) [2016] EWHC 3085 (Fam). Re N provided a magisterial overview of relevant judgments on this topic and, having undertaken that exercise, the President confirmed four criteria for recognition as follows:
The adoptive parents must have been domiciled in the foreign country at the time of the foreign adoption.
The child must have been legally adopted in accordance with the requirements of the foreign law.
The foreign adoption must in substance have the same essential characteristics as an English adoption.
There must be no reason in public policy for refusing recognition.
The decision in Re N also rejected the proposition that the child's best interests were a factor that fell to be considered when deciding whether to recognise an adoption at common law. As far as the question of public policy was concerned, the President emphasised that the principle of public policy in this context had a strictly limited function and was properly confined to particularly egregious cases. In coming to that conclusion, the President relied on a passage from Dicey, Morris & Collins, The Conflict of Laws, ed 15, 2012, para 20-133, cited as follows [paragraph 129]:
""If the foreign adoption was designed to promote some immoral or mercenary object, like prostitution or financial gain to the adopter, it is improbable that it would be recognised in England. But, apart from exceptional cases like these, it is submitted that the court should be slow to refuse recognition to a foreign adoption on the grounds of public policy merely because the requirements for adoption in the foreign law differ from those of the English law. Here again the distinction between recognising the status and giving effect to its results is of vital importance. Public policy may sometimes require that a particular result of a foreign adoption should not be given effect to in England; but public policy should only on the rarest occasions be invoked in order to deny recognition to the status itself.""
The decision in Re N also addressed the impact of Article 8 of the European Convention of Human Rights (""ECHR"") and endorsed the approach taken by MacDonald J in QS v RS and T (No 3)[2016] EWHC 2470 (Fam). In that case, MacDonald J considered whether an application under the court's inherent jurisdiction for recognition of an adoption order made in Nepal could succeed notwithstanding a concern that the applicants could not be said to have been domiciled in Nepal at the time the adoption order was made. In paragraphs 100 and 104, MacDonald J held as follows:
""I am satisfied that in determining an application for the recognition of a foreign adoption at common law and an application for a declaration pursuant to the Family Law Act 1986 s. 57 the court must ensure that it acts in a manner that is compatible with the Art 8 right of the mother, the father and T to respect for family life. Further, within this context, and after much anxious deliberation, I am satisfied that the strict application of the rule as to status conditions in Re Valentines Settlement to the very particular circumstances of this case, with a concomitant refusal to recognise the adoption lawfully constituted in Nepal in terms which substantially conform with the English concept of adoption by reason of the failure to comply with status conditions as to domicile or habitual residence applicable in this country, would result in an interference in the Art 8 right to respect for family life of the mother, father and T that cannot be said to be either necessary or proportionate.""
""My conclusion does not amount to a decision that the rule in Re Valentines Settlement is incompatible with Art 8 of the ECHR per se. Rather, it amounts simply to a decision that the application of that common law rule in the very particular circumstances of this case would breach the Art 8 rights of the parents and T … I make clear that my conclusions are grounded in an application of the cardinal principles incorporated into our domestic law by the Human Rights Act 1998 and the jurisprudence arising out of the ECHR.""
In KN & Anor v RN and Ors [2023] EWHC 712 (Fam), MacDonald J restated the above considerations in a case involving the recognition of an adoption order granted in Nigeria. Paragraphs 65-67 set out in further detail his analysis of the existence of family life for the purpose of Article 8. In that case, MacDonald J was not satisfied that the circumstances of the adoption in Nigeria of one of the two children met the criteria in Re Valentines Settlement given the concerns about the evidence in respect of the birth mother's consent. However, he determined that the strict application of Re Valentines Settlement and a refusal to recognise the Nigerian adoption order would constitute an interference in the Article 8 right to respect for family life of the applicants and both children which was neither necessary nor proportionate.
The four criteria alighted upon by Sir James Munby in Re N (A Child) derive from the Court of Appeal’s majority decision in Re Valentine’s Settlement [1965] Ch 831, where the leading judgment was given by Lord Denning, MR. The first of those criteria requires both of the applicants for adoption have been domiciled in the relevant state at time when the adoption order under consideration was made there. It is apparent from Lord Denning’s judgment that he considered that there were two bases upon which an overseas adoption should be recognised, which he termed ‘international comity’ and ‘principle’.  He said (with my emphasis):
‘But when is the status of adoption duly constituted? Clearly it is so when it is constituted in another country in similar circumstances as we claim for ourselves. Our courts should recognise a jurisdiction which mutatis mutandis they claim for themselves: see Travers v. Holley. We claim jurisdiction to make an adoption order when the adopting parents are domiciled in this country and the child is resident here.So also, out of the comity of country when the adopting parents are domiciled there and the child is resident there.
Apart from international comity, we reach the same result on principle. When a court of any country makes an adoption order for an infant child, it does two things: (1) it destroys the legal relationship theretofore existing between the child and its natural parents, be it legitimate or illegitimate; (2) it creates the legal relationship of parent and child between the child and its adopting parents, making it their legitimate child. It creates a new status in both, namely, the status of parent and child. Now it has long been settled that questions affecting status are determined by the law of the domicile. This new status of parent and child, in order to be recognised everywhere, must be validly created by the law of the domicile of the adopting parent. You do not look to the domicile of the child: for that has no separate domicile of its own. It takes its parents' domicile. You look to the parents domicile only. If you find that a legitimate relationship of parent and child has been validly created by the law of the parents' domicile at the time the relationship is created, then the status so created should be universally recognised throughout the civilised world, provided always that there is nothing contrary to public policy in so recognising it. That general principle finds expression in the judgment of Scott L.J. in In re Luck's Settlement Trusts, Walker v. Luck. I think it is correct, notwithstanding that the majority in that case created a dubious exception to it. But it is an essential feature of this principle that the parents should be domiciled in the country at the time: for no provision of the law of a foreign country will be regarded in the English courts as effective to create the status of a parent in a person not domiciled in that country at the time: see In re Grove, Vaucher v. Treasury Solicitor37 (legitimation by subsequent marriage); In re Wilson, decd., Grace v. Lucas38 (adoption). I ought to say, however, that in order for adoption to be recognised everywhere, it seems to me that, in addition to the adopting parents being domiciled in the country where the order is made, the child should be ordinarily resident there: for it is the courts of ordinary residence which have the pre-eminent jurisdiction over the child: see In re P. (G. E.) (An Infant). The child is under their protection and it would seem only right that those courts should be the courts to decide whether the child should be adopted or not.
In my opinion, therefore, the courts of this country will only recognise an adoption in another country if the adopting parents are domiciled there and the child is ordinarily resident there.’
As the time Re Valentine’s Settlement was decided, it was a requirement for the making of an adoption order in this jurisdiction that the applicant for adoption should be domiciled in England or Scotland: section 50(1) of the Adoption Act 1950. Lord Denning was thus able to conclude that domicile was a pre-requisite to recognition of an overseas adoption whether the matter was considered through the lens of comity or by the application of common law principles.
It is, however, no longer a requirement that each applicant be domiciled in England and Wales in order for the courts of this jurisdiction to make an adoption order in favour of a couple.  Section 49 of the ACA enables the court to make an adoption order in a favour of a couple in circumstances where (a) only one of them is domiciled in a part of the British Islands or (b) both of them have been habitually resident in a part of the British Islands for a period of not less than a year ending with the date of the application.
Given the way in which the law has developed, it seems to me to be at least arguable on an application of Lord Denning’s comity principle that, where a couple seeks recognition of an overseas adoption at common law, it may no longer be necessary to demonstrate that both applicants were domiciled in the relevant overseas jurisdiction in order for the court to recognise an adoption, if they otherwise fulfil the jurisdictional criteria in section of 49 of the ACA 2002 transposed to the overseas jurisdiction in question. I raised this point with counsel before I started hearing evidence as there existed a possibility that I could conclude that one, but not both, of the applicants was domiciled in Nigeria at the relevant time. I have not, however, heard full argument on the point. Given my factual conclusions on domicile, it is not a point that has an impact on my decision.
Domicile
In Barlow Clowes International Ltd (In Liquidation) & Ors v Henwood [2008] EWCA Civ 577 at paragraph 8 Arden LJ summarised a number the principles relevant to the question of domicile.  She said:
‘The following principles of law, which are derived from Dicey, Morris and Collins on The Conflict of Laws (2006) are not in issue:
A person is, in general, domiciled in the country in which he is considered by English law to have his permanent home. A person may sometimes be domiciled in a country although he does not have his permanent home in it (Dicey, pages 122 to 126).
No person can be without a domicile (Dicey, page 126).
No person can at the same time for the same purpose have more than one domicile (Dicey, pages 126 to 128).
An existing domicile is presumed to continue until it is proved that a new domicile has been acquired (Dicey, pages 128 to 129).
Every person receives at birth a domicile of origin (Dicey, pages 130 to 133).
Every independent person can acquire a domicile of choice by the combination of residence and an intention of permanent or indefinite residence, but not otherwise (Dicey, pages 133 to 138).
Any circumstance that is evidence of a person's residence, or of his intention to reside permanently or indefinitely in a country, must be considered in determining whether he has acquired a domicile of choice (Dicey, pages 138 to 143).
In determining whether a person intends to reside permanently or indefinitely, the court may have regard to the motive for which residence was taken up, the fact that residence was not freely chosen, and the fact that residence was precarious (Dicey, pages 144 to 151).
A person abandons a domicile of choice in a country by ceasing to reside there and by ceasing to intend to reside there permanently, or indefinitely, and not otherwise (Dicey, pages 151 to 153).
When a domicile of choice is abandoned, a new domicile of choice may be acquired, but, if it is not acquired, the domicile of origin revives (Dicey, pages 151 to 153).’
In Barlow Clowes, Arden LJ also noted that ""the domicile of origin is tenacious"" (paragraph 85), indicating that strong evidence was needed to show that an alternative domicile of choice had been acquired. It was further held that:
Given that a person can only have one domicile at any one time, he must have a singular and distinctive relationship with the country of supposed domicile of choice. That means it must be his ultimate home or the place where he would wish to spend his last days.
The fact that residence is precarious or illegal is a circumstance that is relevant to the question of intention (but the fact that presence is illegal does not prevent residence).
A person can acquire a domicile of choice without naturalisation. On the other hand, citizenship is not decisive.
Discussion and conclusions
Out of the four criteria for the recognition of an overseas adoption derived from Re Valentine’s Settlement and subsequent authorities (set out at paragraph 38 above) I am satisfied that (b), (c) and (d) are satisfied in this case.
I have considered an expert report as to Nigerian law prepared by Mr Abimbola Badejo of counsel in respect of the adoption.  He sets out that:
‘There is a subsisting order from a court of competent jurisdiction in Nigeria that order remains valid and the consequences under Nigerian law of changing the status of the child to an adopted child’
and
‘The essential characteristic of a Nigerian adoption and an English adoption are  the same in all material respects.’
That evidence has not been challenged by the SSHD and I accept it.
I further accept that I should not refuse to recognise the adoption on public policy grounds.  It is not the type of egregious case which falls within that principle.
So far as domicile is concerned, the evidence of the mother on this issue (with which the father expressly agrees) is set out at paragraph 19 of her second statement as follows:
‘Although my husband and/or both of us were not domiciled in the foreign country at the time of the foreign adoption, my husband has lived in foreign country and shortly before the adoption took place. My husband has been domiciled in Nigeria all his life save for his coming to join me in the UK.’
I am not bound by the applicants’ own assertions as to domicile and have considered the matter in the light of the principles summarised in Barlow Clowes.
So far as the mother is concerned, her domicile of origin was Nigeria.  The question is whether at some stage she acquired a domicile of choice in this jurisdiction. In my judgment, the evidence is very clear that she did so, at the latest, in 2014 when she was granted indefinite leave to remain. Thereafter she proceeded to acquire British citizenship. She has made her home in this jurisdiction and I find that she intends to remain here permanently or indefinitely. This conclusion is strongly supported by the fact that she has remained living here with her husband despite the applicants’ children including C being unable to join them. My conclusion as to her intention is also supported by the steps she has taken to achieve immigration status for C to allow her to join her parents here. I also accept her evidence on the point.
The father too has a domicile of origin in Nigeria. The evidence is less clear as to whether he has acquired a domicile of choice in this jurisdiction. On balance I am satisfied that he has done so. He came to England in October 2016 to join his wife here. She was by that time living here with an intention to do so permanently or indefinitely. He took up employment here. He left behind his children, but has taken steps to procure the ability for them to join their family here. He has now secured indefinite leave to remain in this jurisdiction and intends, as I accept, to obtain British citizenship as soon as he can. I accept his evidence that he intends to make England his permanent home. In my judgment, he acquired a domicile of choice in England and Wales relatively soon after he moved here in October 2016, probably in early 2017. It follows from this that he was domiciled in Nigeria at the time when the applicants first made an adoption application to the LCCC, but domiciled in England by the time of C’s birth and certainly by the time that the adoption order was made.
It follows from my conclusions as to domicile that the first of the Re Valentine’s criteria is not met. It would not be met even if I were to hold that for reasons of comity it is now sufficient to demonstrate that only one of the applicants was domiciled in Nigeria at the material time.
Article 8 ECHR
In common with MacDonald J in QS v RS, I am satisfied on the facts of this case that the strict application of the rule as to status conditions in Re Valentines Settlement, with a concomitant refusal to recognise the adoption lawfully constituted in Nepal in terms which substantially conform with the English concept of adoption, by reason of the failure to comply with status conditions as to domicile applicable in this country, would result in an interference in the Article 8 right to respect for family life of the mother, the father and C. That interference cannot be said to be either necessary or proportionate.
I accept first of all that the mother and the father sought advice before making an application for adoption. They wrongly understood that an adoption in Nigeria would be recognised in England and Wales.
Despite my conclusions as to the domicile of the applicants at the time of the adoption order, Nigeria is a country with which each of them has very substantial connections. They have each been domiciled there for the majority of their lives. The father was domiciled there at the time of the adoption application. They both retain Nigerian nationality. They have significant family ties in that jurisdiction and travel there on a regular basis. They have a home there. In no sense can they be described as adoption tourists.
I also find that this was not what is sometimes termed an adoption of convenience: one motivated primarily by a desire to achieve immigration status for a child with whom the applicants have a limited connection. I accept the evidence of the mother that the applicants wanted to adopt a child to cement their own marriage in circumstances where they were unable to conceive a child together. It my view it was entirely logical and natural for them to pursue the application in Nigeria, the country of which they were both nationals and where the father was both resident and domiciled (when the application was made). By making the application in Nigeria they stood the best chance of achieving a cultural match.
I accept the oral evidence of both the mother and the father as to the love and commitment they have shown to C, with twice daily video calls and annual trips to Nigeria to spend time with her as a family. Although they have delegated C’s day-to-day care to nannies, they have retained overall parental responsibility for her (assisting for example with homework and making decisions about medical care). The mother became visibly emotional in evidence describing the relationship she has with C and recounting C’s repeated pleas to her to be allowed to come to England to join the people she considers to be her parents. C has been brought up with L and, to a lesser extent, D and clearly has strong bonds with them. I have no doubt that the children see each other as siblings. The applicants have also demonstrated significant financial commitment to C.
Most pertinently the applicants are the only parents C has ever known. They are an integral part of her family life. They are recorded on her birth certificate as her parents.  Their wider family is, for C, her extended family too. C’s birth family have played no role in her life.
A failure to recognise C’s adoption by the applicants would amount to a denial of her status. In the eyes of the court her parents would be BM, who abandoned her at birth, and her BF, who abandoned BM following C’s conception. From her perspective this would be profoundly wrong.
In all of the circumstances, I have determined that I should accede to the application for recognition of C’s adoption and do so.

PENSIONS
In the matter of the Arcadia Group Pension Scheme and the Arcadia Group Senior Executives Pension Scheme
MASTER MARSH (sitting in retirement)
Rolls Building
Fetter Lane
London EC4A 1NL
BETWEEN:
ARCADIA GROUP PENSION TRUST LIMITED
Claimant
and
JOANNE TERESA SMITH
Defendant
JUDGMENT
Hearing 26 November 2024
Judgment delivered remotely on 3 February 2025
The claimant is the trustee of the Arcadia Group Pension Scheme (“the Staff Scheme”). The principal employer, Arcadia Group Limited (“Arcadia”), now AGL Realisations Limited, went into administration on 30 November 2020. On 9 April 2022 it went into liquidation.
Arcadia is also the principal employer of what has been described as a ‘sister scheme’, the Arcadia Group Senior Executives Pension Scheme (""the Executive Scheme"") of which AG Senior Executives Pension Trustee Limited is the trustee.
Both the Staff Scheme and the Executive Scheme are in the course of being wound up.
At the disposal hearing of this Part 8 claim on 26 November 2024 I made declarations that:
The claimant would be acting within the scope and purpose of the amendment power of the Staff Scheme in amending its rules so as to permit a merger of the Executive Scheme into the Staff Scheme.
The Claimant's proposed exercise of the amendment power, and thereafter the exercise of the amended power to effect a merger of the Executive Scheme into the Staff Scheme, is approved.
This judgment provides my reasons for granting this relief.
Nicolas Stallworthy KC and Charlotte Elves appeared for the claimant and Richard Hitchcock KC appeared for the defendant. I am grateful to counsel for their careful and measured submissions, both written and oral.
The Staff Scheme was established in 1991 to simplify and amalgamate the various pension schemes within the group which then existed. Its first Definitive Deed and Rules was executed in 1994. The Staff Scheme was closed to new members with effect from 31 July 2005. This was reflected in a Deed of Variation with a new Deed and Rules dated 26 March 2009. A further Deed of Variation dated 29 December 2010 adopted a new Trust Deed and Rules (“the 2010 Trust Deed and Rules”) to replace the 2009 Trust Deed and Rules which ended the accrual of benefits for members with effect from 1 January 2011. Amendments to the Executive Scheme to close it to new members and to end accrual mirrored the changes to the Staff Scheme.
The proceedings come about because the claimant wishes to amend the 2010 Trust Deed and Rules so as to be able to accept a bulk transfer-in to the Staff Scheme of the beneficiaries, assets and liabilities of the Executive Scheme on an unsegregated basis. But for the fact that the claimant intends to use the power to amend the Staff Scheme at a time when both it and the Executive Scheme are in the course of being wound up and Arcadia is in liquidation, the proposal would be uncontroversial. However, in light of the late stage at which the power is to be exercised, the claimant considered it was appropriate to seek confirmation that there was no fetter on the power to amend and its use was for a proper purpose; and given that the decision can be characterised as a momentous one, the court’s approval was also sought.
The defendant was appointed by an order of Master Bowles (sitting in retirement) made pursuant to CPR rule 19.9(2) to represent all beneficiaries of the Staff Scheme in whose interests it might be to oppose the relief sought. She has had the benefit of independent specialist legal advice from Sacker & Partners and Mr Hitchcock. She concluded with the benefit of their advice that there are no realistic grounds upon which to oppose the claim. In accordance with the practice referred to in the Chancery Guide at 26.28 the defendant has been permitted to file a confidential opinion produced by Mr Hitchcock explaining why the claim is not opposed. The opinion has not been seen by the claimant. In addition, the court had the benefit, after hearing Mr Stallworthy’s submissions, of a hearing in private to consider Mr Hitchcock’s advice.
In Re Egerton Trust Retirement Benefit Scheme, which is quoted by Hart J in Public Trustee v Cooper [2001] WLTR 901, Robert Walker J (as he then was) categorised the different types of application trustees may wish to make seeking the assistance of the court. This claim concerns categories (1) and (2) which were explained by Robert Walker J in the following way:
The first category is where the issue is whether some proposed action is within the trustees’ powers. That is ultimately a question of construction of the trust instrument or a statute or both. The practice of the Chancery Division is that a question of that sort must be decided in open court and only after hearing argument from both sides. It is not always easy to distinguish that situation from the second situation that I am coming to …
The second category is where the issue is whether the proposed course of action is a proper exercise of the trustees’ powers where there is no real doubt as to the nature of the trustees’ powers and the trustees have decided how they want to exercise them but, because the decision is particularly momentous, the trustees wish to obtain the blessing of the court for the action on which they have resolved and which is within their powers … In such circumstances … they think it prudent and the court will give them their costs of doing so to obtain the court’s blessing on a momentous decision. In a case like that, there is no question of surrender of discretion and indeed it is most unlikely that the court will be persuaded in the absence of special circumstances to accept the surrender of discretion on a question of that sort, where the trustees are prima facie in a much better position than the court to know what is in the best interests of the beneficiaries.”
Although Robert Walker J indicated that Public Trustee v Cooper categories (1) and (2) are not always easy to distinguish, there is a clear difference in the role of the court in this case. The first declaration made by the court determines a binary issue, namely whether the proposed exercise of powers by the claimant to amend the Staff Scheme is within the scope and purpose of the claimant’s powers under the scheme. The exercise of that power to amend to enable a merger to take place at a time when the schemes are in the course of being wound up is unusual. The second declaration provides approval to the exercise of the power on the basis that the decision is a ‘momentous’ one.
If the court is asked only to consider a category (2) application, it is inevitable that the court will wish to be satisfied that as a preliminary point the proposed exercise of power is within the scope of the trustee’s powers and for a proper purpose. However, category (2) is more concerned with the process of exercising the powers. The court is not concerned with whether the decision is objectively ‘correct’ (in the sense that it is a decision the court would have made if asked) but rather whether the decision can be objectively justified and whether a proper process of decision making has been followed. Richard Smith J recently summarised the role of the court in a category (2) application in Brass Trustees Limited v Goldstone (Re Biwater Retirement and Security Scheme) [2023] EWHC 1978 (Ch) at [50]:
“The role of the court in a ‘blessing’ application such as this is limited, namely to see that the proposed exercise of the trustees’ powers is lawful and within the power, and that it does not infringe the trustees’ duty to act as ordinary, reasonable and prudent trustees might act, ignoring irrelevant, improper or irrational factors. In doing this, it requires to be satisfied only that:
The trustees have in fact formed the opinion that they should act in the way for which they seek approval;
The opinion of the trustees was one which a reasonable body of trustees, correctly instructed as to the meaning of the relevant clause, could properly have arrived at – including taking into account relevant considerations and ignoring irrelevant considerations; and
The opinion was not vitiated by any conflict of interest under which any of the trustees was labouring.”
Background
The court was provided with a substantial body of evidence from Alda Andreotti who is chair of the claimant and Fiona Wenlock who is a director of the claimant. In addition to providing evidence of the background and the process by which the claimant made a decision in principle to amend the rules of the Staff Scheme to permit a merger with the Executive Scheme, they explain how the two schemes have been operated in tandem with each other.
The two schemes have been described in the evidence and in submissions as ‘sister’ schemes. That is not a term of art but is a useful way to see them. The two schemes have a common principal employer. Other indicators of their close relationship are:
There is a material overlap in the composition of their respective boards of directors. The decision in principle taken by the claimant’s board of directors was the decision of Fiona Wenlock, who had been re-appointed to the board for this purpose, because all the other directors are also directors of the corporate trustee of the Executive Scheme.
They share the same administrators and professional advisors.
The trustees have adopted a common approach to the management of the schemes and meetings of their boards were usually joint meetings unless a particular decision required a scheme specific meeting to be organised.
They have had a joint investment and funding committee and a joint approach to funding. One aggregate pension contribution was negotiated from Arcadia and then apportioned between the schemes by the Trustees who sought, based upon actuarial advice, to achieve parity between the schemes.
On promotion within the Arcadia Group employees have transferred from the Staff Scheme to the Executive Scheme. Approximately 50% of members of the Executive Scheme were transferred from the Staff Scheme.
Both schemes were closed to new membership in 2005 and to future accrual in 2010.
The attitude of the boards of directors is helpfully illustration by Fiona Wenlock in her witness statement where she says:
Throughout my time as a Trustee director, there has always been a sense of ‘togetherness’ and a shared goal of the directors of both Trustees of wishing to optimise the position of both Schemes. As such, while I have been a director of the [claimant], in my experience the way in which the Schemes are run, the governance that was put in place, the behaviours of the directors of the Trustees and how the Schemes were run side-by-side as ‘sister schemes’ meant there was never a sense that we needed to merge them, which would have cost money to do.”
There were funding concerns about both schemes but historically there was greater concern about underfunding in the Staff Scheme. Although as Fiona Wenlock indicates there was thought to be no need for the schemes to be merged, events have, wholly unexpectedly, led to the Staff Scheme being in surplus and the Executive Scheme being in deficit. This is despite over recent years both schemes having been managed in a way which was designed to achieve parity between them based upon actuarial advice.
The joint approach of the both trustees to funding can be further illustrated by the events subsequent to 2019.  In June 2019 a Creditors Voluntary Arrangement was proposed to restructure the Arcadia Group. This caused the Staff Scheme and the Executive Scheme to enter a Pension Protection Fund (“PPF”) assessment period and followed prior regulatory action by the PPF against Sir Philip Green and others in connection with the BHS schemes. Three structures were put in place with the PPF’s agreement to achieve scheme rescues involving their exit from PPF assessment periods consequent on the restructuring of the Arcadia Group under the CVA.
By a deed dated 11 June 2019 (“the LCG Deed”) Lady Cristina Green committed to pay £100 million to the schemes without a split between the schemes being determined.
Clause 3.6 of the LCG Deed provided that:
“The Trustees will procure that each of the Subsequent Payments are split between the Arcadia Schemes in such fixed proportions as are decided by the Arcadia Schemes' Actuary … such that the Funding Levels of the Arcadia Schemes are projected to become equivalent to each other on the date the final Subsequent Payment is due to be paid. The Actuary will project from 31 March 2019 using the 2019 Funding Basis together with the assumptions to be used in the Recovery Plans for the 31 March 2019 valuations and taking account of the deficit repair contributions payable pursuant to the relevant Recovery Plan before the final Subsequent Payment is due to be paid.”
The first £25 million received from Lady Green was paid to the Staff Scheme because at the time of the CVA it was understood to be much less well funded than the Executive Scheme. In the event, the entirety of the £100 million from Lady Green was paid to the Staff Scheme because of the understanding at the time about the relative disparity of funding between the two schemes.
(ii)A deed dated 4 June 2019 (“the Pensions Deed”) was entered between the trustees of the schemes and Arcadia Group companies setting out aggregate deficit repair contributions for the schemes. Clause 6.17(b) of the Pensions Deed provided that, pursuant to the 2019 actuarial valuation:
“… the split of those aggregate contributions between the Schemes shall be determined so that the recovery periods under each Scheme's Recovery Plan shall be the same”.
The Pensions Deed also sought to give the schemes an equal funding level. Pursuant to the Pensions Deed, the Staff Scheme received a greater ‘split’ of the aggregate contributions than the Executive Scheme.
A security package was put in place for the schemes to secure their respective contingent statutory debts under section 75 of the Pensions Act 1995 which would fall due in the event of a subsequent insolvency (“the Security Arrangements”). A deed dated 4 June 2019 between the claimant and the trustee of the Executive Scheme (“the Security Trustee Deed”) appointed the claimant as the Security Trustee in connection with the Security Arrangements. Clause 3.1.3 of the Security Trust Deed provided that sums recovered by the Security Trustee from time to time should be distributed to the schemes’ trustees “in the proportions that the Schemes' respective Section 75 deficits at the relevant time bear to the aggregate of the section 75 deficits for the Schemes at that time).”  This again sought to ensure an equal funding level between the schemes. By June 2022, pursuant to this provision, the Staff Scheme had received 85% of the sums recovered under the Security Arrangements.
Arcadia Group companies went into administration in November 2020. This caused both the Staff Scheme and the Executive Scheme to enter a PPF assessment period for a second time. The administrations also triggered a separate statutory debt under section 75 in respect of each scheme. As required by legislation, those debts were certified on 1 April 2022 by reference to each scheme’s buy-out deficit at the date of administration. Recoveries in respect of those section 75 debts were made initially under the Security Arrangements and later as pari passu distributions from the liquidators in respect of the unsecured balances.
On 3 February 2023 the claimant was able to purchase a ‘buy-in’ policy with Aviva, securing all of the accrued liabilities to all beneficiaries of the Staff Scheme in full. The trustee of the Executive Scheme completed a buy-in on the same date but was only able to secure 87% of the value of its accrued liabilities. Both buy-ins were provisional, to the extent that they permitted the benefits secured to be increased on receipt of further distributions from the liquidators in respect of the unsecured balance of each scheme’s respective section 75 debt.
Thereafter, because each scheme had been able to secure benefits above the level of PPF compensation, they exited their respective PPF assessment periods.
From well before the CVA until June 2022, actuarial predictions had been that the Staff Scheme was less well funded than the Executive Scheme. As a consequence, the great majority of contributions and recoveries were apportioned in favour of the Staff Scheme.
The reversal in the schemes’ respective funding levels is due to a combination of variables, including market volatility occasioned by the 2022 mini-budget, improvements in insurer pricing for pension schemes seeking to secure their liabilities, scheme ‘experience’ (e.g. mortality of beneficiaries) and the ‘shape’ of Staff Scheme benefits being priced more favourably than the ‘shape’ of Executive Scheme benefits. The insurance market and economic conditions, amongst other matters, have led to an unexpected outcome.
The Security Arrangements have been fully performed. Each scheme retains only its unsecured claim in the Arcadia’s liquidation in respect of the remaining balance of that scheme’s respective section 75 debts. Future recoveries in respect of those unsecured claims will only increase the disparity in funding between the two schemes, not least because the debt due to the Staff Scheme is so much greater than the debt due to the Executive Scheme: £431 million compared with £76 million.
The latest update from Barnett Waddingham, the actuaries appointed by both schemes, based upon figures as at 30 September 2024, indicates that if dividends in respect of the section 75 claims are paid at 28.8p in the £, the Staff Scheme will have a surplus of £35 million and the Executive Scheme a deficit of £11 million. Even if the dividend is 35p in the £ the Executive Scheme will still have a deficit. There is a possibility, albeit an unlikely one, that section 75 recoveries could reach a level at which the Executive Scheme has a surplus, but there would in that scenario be a significant mismatch of funding between the two schemes. If the schemes merge, there will be a surplus to be shared amongst all beneficiaries.
2010 Trust Deed and Rules
The Staff Scheme is currently governed by the 2010 Trust Deed and Rules.
The claimant intends to exercise the power to amend the Staff Scheme so as to permit merger with the Executive Scheme. The amendment power is found in clause 9 which provides:
""The Company may from time to time with the consent of the Trustees by deed or written instrument alter or add to any of the trusts and provisions of this Deed or the Rules. Any alteration or addition may have retrospective effect.""
However, Clause 12.9 makes it clear that the power continues until the Staff Scheme is wound up and where the principal employer is in liquidation, the power is “… in the Trustees who may exercise it without the need for the Company’s consent.”
Clause 1.2 of the Trust Deed provides:
“Object
The main object of the Scheme is to provide Scale Benefits for, and in respect of, those persons who are at any time Members.
For the purposes of this Clause, ""Scale Benefits"" means benefits to which Members and other persons are entitled on retirement or death calculated on the scale set out in the Rules. It does not include any additional benefits which might be provided by means of augmentation of benefits or amendment, or on termination (whether total or partial) of the Scheme, except where such benefits have already been granted.”
It is of key importance that the object of the Staff Scheme, namely the provision of Scale Benefits, does not give members a right to receive additional benefits by way of augmentation.
The winding up provisions in clause 12.2 require that the Fund must be used to provide for the “Basic Entitlements” (as they are defined in that clause) of “Identified Beneficiaries” who are defined in clause 11.4 as ""all Members living on the Termination Date and ... all persons entitled to receive benefits as a result of the membership of Members who died on or before the Termination Date"".
Under clause 12.3 the trustee has a discretion to make additional payments. It provides that:
""If the Fund is more than sufficient to provide the Basic Entitlements, the Trustees may, with the consent of the Company (except as provided below) and after consulting the Actuary, use the balance of the Fund to augment the Basic Entitlements and/or to provide other benefits for or in respect of Members who are Identified Beneficiaries (or who would be Identified Beneficiaries if still living). The consent of the Company is not required if it is in liquidation, administrative receivership, administration or is dissolved.""
Under clause 12.4, any balance of the Fund that is left over after payment of Basic Entitlements and Augmentation (if any) “will be paid to the Employers in such shares as the Trustees, after consulting the Actuary, think appropriate ..."".
There is therefore a clear distinction in the 2010 Trust Deed and Rules between Basic Entitlements and Augmentation. The trustee is required to pay the former whereas there is a discretionary power to pay the latter. A dilution of the surplus in the Staff Scheme will not deprive any scheme member of a benefit to which there is an entitlement. It would, however, result in the surplus that is available for distribution by way of augmentation being reduced.
One of the key changes to the Staff Scheme was made in 2010 was to introduce Rule 1.3 which provides that:
“No transfer of assets may be accepted into the Fund from any other pension scheme.”
This contrasts with Rule 1.4 of the 2009 Deed and Rules which, like the 1994 Rules, made express provision for bulk transfers into the Staff Scheme. The earlier provisions also contained provisions enabling former members to re-join the Staff Scheme and the 2009 Rules introduced provisions for the re-instatement of former members who had transferred out.
However, the 2010 Trust Deed and Rules still contains power by clause 4.2 to create separate classes of members and separate funds:
“The Trustees shall have power with the consent of the Company by deed to make or adopt additional Rules or sets of Rules to apply to particular classes or categories of employees or Members (or other persons entitled to benefit) and also to set aside within the Fund a separate fund or funds of such amounts as they shall determine after taking the advice of the Actuary to hold for such particular classes or categories of employees or Members or other persons to the intent that such employees or Members or other persons shall be entitled to benefit only from such separate fund or funds.”
Scope of the power to amend
The principal proposed amendment is to Rule 12.3 by adding sub-rule (A) providing that the claimant may (after consulting the Actuary) use the balance of the Fund:
in conjunction with a block transfer to the [Staff Scheme] of all of the assets of the [Executive Scheme] to accept a merger of the Executive Scheme and its beneficiaries into the [Staff Scheme] and thereupon provide the benefits for such beneficiaries previously prescribed by the Executive Scheme as their basic entitlements thereunder, provided that accepting such a transfer does not prevent Identified Beneficiaries being provided with their Basic Entitlements: and/or
…”
The express terms of the power to amend the Staff Scheme are broad and it is expressly provided that (a) the power continues until the Staff Scheme has been wound up and (b) if the principal employer is in liquidation the power vests solely in the trustee. Both provisions are entirely understandable given the possible need to amend in the course of winding up and the fact that if the principal employer is in liquidation the insolvency regime might well lead to a mis-alignment of the interests of the Staff Scheme and the company. The initial issue for the court as to the scope of the power to amend is whether the power is subject to an implied fetter when it is in the course of being wound up and/or the company is in liquidation.
Mr Stallworthy’s starting point concerning powers to amend is the observations made by Millett J (as he then was) in Re Courage Group’s Pension Schemes [1987] 1 All ER 528, at 537f to j:
“… I should make some general observations on the approach which I conceive ought to be adopted by the court to the construction of the trust deed and rules of a pension scheme. First, there are no special rules of construction applicable to a pension scheme; nevertheless, its provisions should wherever possible be construed to give reasonable and practical effect to the scheme, bearing in mind that it has to be operated against a constantly changing commercial background. It is important to avoid unduly fettering the power to amend the provisions of the scheme, thereby preventing the parties from making those changes which may be required by the exigencies of commercial life. This is particularly the case where the scheme is intended to be for the benefit not of the employees of a single company, but of a group of companies. The companies of the group may constantly change as companies are disposed of and new companies are acquired; and such changes may need to be reflected by modifications to the scheme.
Second, in the case of an institution of long duration and gradually changing membership like a club or pension scheme, each alteration in the rules must be tested by reference to the situation at the time of the proposed alteration, and not by reference to the original rules at its inception. By changes made gradually over a long period, alterations may be made which would not be acceptable if introduced all at once. Even the main purpose may be changed by degrees …”.
Lord Walker in giving the decision of the Privy Council in Bank of New Zealand v Board of Management of the Bank of New Zealand Officers’ Provident Association [2003] UKPC 58 at [19] cited this passage with approval.
It is also helpful to have in mind the observations made by Neuberger J (as he then was) in Capital Cranfield Trust Corporation Ltd v Sagar and others [2002] OPLR 151 in the context of a trustee having express power to alter or modify any of the scheme’s provisions when the company had gone into liquidation. Neuberger J could see no basis for construing the rules so as to imply a fetter on the powers of the trustees.
""... the fact that the proposed amendment or amendments would be with a view to altering matters in connection with winding up would not be a good view to altering matters in connection with winding up would not be a good reason. The contrary view would involve implying fetters on the power to vary reason. The contrary view would involve implying fetters on the power to vary which are not to be found in clause 4 or clause 19(b)(iii).
In my judgment, particularly given that there are express fetters, it would be wrong to imply any further fetters unless it was plainly necessary and obvious that they should be implied. On the contrary, in the present case I think that it is by no means plain that such fetters should be implied. ..."".
There are no express fetters on the power in the case of the Staff Scheme 2010 Trust Deed and Rules. In answer to the question ‘is there a principled basis upon which a fetter should be implied’ the clear answer is ‘no’. It may be unusual for an amendment to be made in the course of winding up a scheme with the company in liquidation so as to permit a merger but that is not to the point. The power to amend was used in 2010 to introduce clause 1.3 which prevents a merger. The power to amend was expressly preserved for use by the trustee in the course of winding up the scheme and no express fetter was imposed. The power was intended to be both wide and flexible. There is no reason to consider that it was intended to have a more limited scope when exercised solely by the trustee.
Proper Exercise of Powers
I turn to consider whether the proposed amendment is a proper exercise of the claimant’s powers. The court has to consider whether adding beneficiaries to the Staff Scheme would be outside the proper exercise of the power of amendment because it affects the existing interests of beneficiaries who have a contingent interest in discretionary augmentation from a surplus. The merger would reduce the surplus and their interest would be diluted.
The Privy Council has recently provided guidance on the proper exercise of powers in the context of private trusts in Grand View Private Trust Co Ltd v Wong. The appeal concerns the laws of Bermuda but there is no reason to suppose that there is any difference with the laws of England and Wales.
The following principles can be summarised from the judgment of the Privy Council given by Lord Richards:
The proper purpose, or purposes, of a fiduciary power is to be determined as at the date of the instrument conferring the power and is to be objectively determined. [61]
Where the instrument is silent about the purpose of the power, “… ascertaining its purpose depends on an inference from the mischief of the provision conferring it, which is itself deduced from its express terms, from an analysis of their effect, and from the court’s understanding of the business context.” Lord Sumption in Eclairs Group Ltd v JKX Oil & Gas plc [2015] UKSC 71 [30].
The identification of the purpose of a power will also be informed by the rest of the instrument containing the power. [62]
“It is generally the case that fiduciary powers conferred on a trustee of a trust with identified beneficiaries must be exercised to further the interests of the beneficiaries.” [120]
The power to add or exclude beneficiaries is a power of a potentially different character. “… the question of the purpose of such a power is not to be answered by applying, as an overriding principle, a rule that all powers must be exercised in the interests of some or all or the beneficiaries, unless express provision to the contrary is made. The task is to discern the intended purpose of the particular power of addition and exclusion in the context of the particular trust. This requires the approach of considering the power in the context of the trust instrument, and the circumstances surrounding it …”.  [121]
The instrument conferring the power to amend is the 2010 Trust Deed and Rules. A power to amend in substantially the same form has been part of the scheme since it was set up by an Interim Trust Deed. Whether the proposed exercise of the power to amend is outside its proper purpose falls to be determined by considering the 2010 Trust Deed and Rules looking at the instrument as a whole in its context.
Mr Stallworthy and Mr Hitchcock both submitted that the court is entitled to have regard to the fact that from inception in 1991 and up to 2005 new members were admitted, that under Rule 1.4 of the 1994 and 2009 Deed and Rules bulk transfer of assets into the Fund from another pension scheme was permitted and that former members could re-join or be re-instated. There is, however, an issue about whether the relevant context in which the 2010 Trust Deed and Rules are considered includes not just the Staff Scheme in the form in which it is found in 2010 (being the instrument conferring the power to amend) but also earlier versions of the scheme and the manner in which the power has been exercised up to that date. If the context in which the 2010 Trust Deed and Rules does not include the scheme’s history of changes it is more likely that a narrow view would be taken of the power to amend because it is closed to new members and prohibits merger.
I am persuaded, however, that relevant context does include the history of the scheme because a review of the exercise of a power to amend should involve not just looking at the scheme in its last iteration but also how the power to amend has been used to create the scheme in its current form. This is illustrated by the fact that it was only in 2009 that the Staff Scheme was closed to merger. If the power was used in that way in 2009, and that was then an exercise for proper purposes, why might it not be a proper purpose to reverse that change the following year?
Although it is not a necessary part of the reasoning in this decision, I also do not find it easy to square Robert Walker J’s observation in Re Courage that “each alteration in the rules must be tested by reference to the situation at the time of the proposed alteration, and not by reference to the original rules at its inception” with a requirement to assess the proper purpose of a power at the date of the instrument giving the power to amend. Pension schemes may evolve by serial use of the power to amend. When considering proper purposes, it is obviously right for the context in which the decision is being made to be considered and for the court to have regard to the manner in which both schemes have been managed since 2010, the insolvency events and how the additional funding from Lady Green has been applied. It may be a gloss to the principle summarised at paragraph 45(i) above is needed to reconcile the tension between the date of determination of proper purposes and the circumstances that may be taken into account.
The Privy Council makes it clear in Grand View v Wong that the purpose of the trust is of central importance. Clause 1 of the 2010 Trust Deed and Rules provides for one objective namely the provision of Scale Benefits for persons “who are at any time Members” and Scale Benefits do not include benefits by way of augmentation. The objective contemplates a changing group of members with new members being admitted. Notwithstanding the changes to the scheme in 2010 the objective is one that has the potential to apply to a changing class of persons. There is therefore no reason to treat the 2010 changes to the scheme as being immutable. The circumstances that pertain in 2024 are quite different to those of 2010.
The key changes that will be implemented using the power to amend will be to undo the change to clause 1.1 (no employee is eligible to join the scheme) and clause 1.3 (no transfer of assets may be accepted into the scheme). Such a change does not undermine the principal purpose of the Staff Scheme. Critically, as the Privy Council pointed out in Grand View v Wong at [121] there is no overriding principle that all powers must be exercised in the interests of some or all of the beneficiaries (unless express provision to the contrary is made). The interests of the current members of the Staff Scheme do not have to be considered exclusively.
To my mind the key elements for the court to have in mind in this case are:
The unrestricted nature of the power to amend. Having amended the scheme to exclude new members and mergers there is no fetter on the power being exercised to reverse that amendment if circumstances warrant it.
The manner in which the main object of the scheme is defined and the fact that the main object of funding Basic Entitlements (ie full scale benefits) can be achieved notwithstanding the merger. A merger of the two schemes does not deprive members of the Staff Scheme of an entitlement in accordance with its Main Objects. It merely dilutes their contingent interest in augmentation.
(iii)The close relationship between the Staff and Executive Schemes. In using the surplus in the Staff Scheme to benefit members of the Executive Scheme the claimant would be providing pension benefits the principal employer intended those members to receive, albeit the intention was that they receive those benefits through the Executive Scheme.
(iv)The shared objective of trustees to achieve a surplus in both schemes. That objective was pursued with the benefit of advice from shared professional advisers.
The fact that there is a surplus in the Staff Scheme and a deficit in the Executive Scheme was an unintended consequence of forces outside of the control of the trustees.
Some support can be found in Bank of New Zealand v Board of Management of the bank of New Zealand Officers’ Provident Association [2003] UKPC 58 where the Privy Council held that it was within the power of amendment to make amendments providing new or increased benefits for former employees who were not current beneficiaries provided it did not disturb the accrued rights of present beneficiaries.
I am satisfied that the claimant is intending to use the power to amend so as to permit a merger of the two schemes for a proper purpose.
The claimant’s ‘In Principle’ Decision
The second limb of Public Trustee v Cooper focuses on the process of decision making. The court, before giving approval, and having been satisfied that the proposed decision is within the scope and proper purpose of the trustee’s powers, will be concerned about the factors that have been taken into account in reaching the decision and ensuring that any conflicts of interest have been resolved or at least managed in a satisfactory way.
Helpful guidance about decision making by trustees is set out by Richard Smith J in Brass Trustees Ltd v Goldstone:
When exercising a fiduciary power, trustees are required to inform themselves of the relevant facts and take into account relevant factors and ignore irrelevant ones (Harris v Shuttleworth [1994] ICR 991 at 999G-H; Pitt v Holt [2013] 2 AC 108; Lewin on Trusts (20th ed.) at [29-023]-[29-025] and [29-041]-[29-044]). As Lewin points out, although a number of authorities talk of taking into account ‘all relevant matters’, the range of circumstances required to be taken into account will depend on context. For example, time, urgency, quantum and cost may play a part. Lewin considers that the duty to take into consideration relevant matters is best regarded as an element of the duty to act responsibly. Trustees must have a rational basis for a decision but will be in breach only if a given matter is so significant that a failure to take it into account would be irrational. As to what is a relevant matter to take into account, the authorities, such as they are, indicate that this too depends on context, including the nature of the trust and power under consideration (Pitt v Holt [2011] EWCA Civ 197, [2012] Ch. 132 at [114]).
Trustees should also act rationally (sometimes expressed as not acting capriciously) and reasonably. The distinction between rationality and reasonableness was explained (in a different context) in Hayes v Willoughby [2013] 1 WLR 935 at [14] in the following terms:- ‘Rationality is not the same as reasonableness. Reasonableness is an external, objective standard applied to the outcome of a person's thoughts or intentions. … A test of rationality, by comparison, applies a minimum objective standard to the relevant person's mental processes. It imports a requirement of good faith, a requirement that there should be some logical connection between the evidence and the ostensible reasons for the decision, and (which will usually amount to the same thing) an absence of arbitrariness, of capriciousness or of reasoning so outrageous in its defiance of logic as to be perverse.’
The test of reasonableness is often described as Wednesbury reasonableness …. This requires the trustee not to act as no reasonable trustee would. In Edge v Pensions Ombudsman [1998] Ch 512, this was put in terms of not taking a decision that ‘that no reasonable body of trustees properly directing themselves could have reached’ (Edge at 534, affirmed by the Court of Appeal in [2000] Ch. 602).”
The decision of the Court of Appeal in Edge v Pensions Ombudsman has particular relevance here. Chadwick LJ in giving the judgment of the court reviewed the considerations to which a pension trustee might have regard in determining what to do with a scheme’s surplus. Three points in particular emerge from the judgment:
The court should usually have regard to the circumstances in which the surplus has arisen and give weight to those who are the effective source of the surplus. (626D)
The essential requirement is for the trustee to address the question of what is fair and reasonable in all the circumstances. (627D)
(iii)Exercising fiduciary powers often requires a trustee to weigh the interests of one cohort of beneficiaries against the interests of another cohort of beneficiaries or even non-beneficiaries:
“Properly understood, the so-called duty to act impartially - on which the ombudsman placed such reliance - is no more than the ordinary duty which the law imposes on a person who is entrusted with the exercise of a discretionary power: that he exercises the power for the purpose for which it is given, giving proper consideration to the matters which are relevant and excluding from consideration matters which are irrelevant. If pension fund trustees do that, they cannot be criticised if they reach a decision which appears to prefer the claims of one interest - whether that of employers, current employees or pensioners - over others. The preference will be the result of a proper exercise of the discretionary power.” (627D)
The decision of the board of the claimant was made by Fiona Wenlock on her own on 5 June 2024 because she is the only director of the claimant who does not have a conflict of interest by virtue of being a member of the Executive Scheme or a director of the Executive Scheme’s trustee. She had the benefit of a written opinion produced by Mr Stallworthy. Minutes of the board meeting held on 5 June 2024 record the purpose of the meeting in the following way:
The purpose of the meeting was to discuss, and, if considered appropriate, approve the merger (the ""Merger"") of the Scheme with the Arcadia Group Senior Executives Pension Scheme (""AGSEPS""), to be achieved by a bulk transfer of all assets and assumption of all liabilities from the AGSEPS on an unsegregated basis, or by any other measures having similar economic effect.
It was NOTED that the rationale for the Merger, in broad terms, would be to ensure fair and equal treatment of the Scheme and the AGSEPS, by enabling future recoveries from the shared sponsor of the Scheme and the AGSEPS to be applied in a way which would enable all members of both pension schemes to receive the full value of their accrued pension entitlements.
It was further NOTED that this would give effect to the longstanding joint objective of the Trustee and the trustee of the AGSEPS, which was that the trustees of the two pension schemes should work in collaboration to achieve the full funding of both pension schemes.”
The minute goes some way to show that relevant considerations were taken into account in making the decision. The evidence goes further and shows that Fiona Wenlock took into account:
That the main object of the Staff Scheme was to provide for Basic Entitlements for Members.
That the trustee has a discretion to provide augmentation for members from any surplus remaining after the provision of Basic Entitlements as well as a discretion to return that surplus to the Company.
Merger of the two schemes would dilute the Staff Scheme’s funding level but would not affect the trustee’s ability to pay Basic Entitlements to Members.
The circumstances in which the surplus has arisen.
(v)What is fair and equitable in all the circumstances.
This last consideration is clearly one of the major drivers for the merger. There is no obligation on the part of the claimant to amend the scheme to enable a merger to take place but there is a strong moral obligation. This is an entirely proper matter for the claimant to have taken into account. The funding arrangements for the two schemes have been managed with a view to achieving equality between them and it is only as a consequence of unforeseen circumstances that it has not been achieved. Favouring the Staff Scheme over the Executive Scheme in the distribution of receipts, such as payments made by Lady Green, has meant that the Executive Scheme is the effective source of the surplus.
The minute of the board meeting held on 5 June 2024 goes on to note the conflicts of interest that were declared and concludes with a record of the decision made by Fiona Wenlock alone to a merger of the two schemes being approved in principle.
The claimant has had regard to a broad range of factors and has reached a balanced decision that is objectively justifiable. There is no indication that irrelevant factors have been taken into account. I am satisfied that the approach adopted by the claimant’s board and Ms Wenlock manages the conflict of interest in a way that prevents the decision being tainted and that the decision made in principle is one that should be approved.
Representative beneficiary
The defendant has played an important role in considering the proposed amendment to the scheme rules and testing whether it could properly be opposed. The view has been reached with the benefit of specialist advice that the claim cannot be defended.
Announcements
The claimant’s proposals have been announced to members of both schemes in communications dated 6 June, 6 August and 8 November 2024. No member has articulated any objection to the merger proposal.
In addition, the claimant informed the PPF and the Pension Regulator of the proposed merger proposal. The PPF replied saying:
“… the PPF have no objection, regarding the merits of the proposed merger as described in the Trustee's Briefing Note. I am aware that the Trustee has worked tirelessly to ensure the best member outcomes throughout PPF assessment, and that continues in respect of the work it is now undertaking.”
The Pension Regulator replied saying:
“In relation to the proposed merger of the two schemes, we understand the trustees rationale for proceeding with this step, which includes giving consideration to the efforts made historically to bring up the levels of funding in the main staff scheme relative to the exec scheme. Accordingly we have no further questions or observations at this time”
Finally, the claimant has also notified the liquidator of the Arcadia Group (Teneo) who stated that Teneo was neutral and had no interest in the merger.

THE COUNTY COURT IN ZAGREB, CROATIA

Amanda Bostock (instructed by CPS Extradition Unit) for the Respondent
Hearing dates: 21 November 2024
Approved Judgment
This judgment was handed down remotely at 10.30am on Monday 2025-February-3 by circulation to the parties or their representatives by e-mail and by release to the National Archives.
.............................
Mr Justice Dove:
The appellant is a national of Croatia. Whilst this matter has an extensive history, the direct subject matter of this appeal is the issuing of an arrest warrant (“AW”) by the respondent judicial authority on 1 March 2022. The appellant is wanted for a judgment of the Municipal Court of Novi Zagreb on 30 May 2018, which was confirmed by the judgment of the County Court of Rijeka on 2020-November-4. A sentence of 2 years and 10 months was imposed of which the appellant still has 1 year 2 months and 7 days to serve.
The sentence relates to the appellant’s conviction for tax fraud involving around £250,000. In 2009, after the commission of these offences, the appellant moved to the UK and settled here. Criminal proceedings were already on foot at the time when he left Croatia and in due course an arrest warrant was issued in January 2016. He challenged those proceedings and a hearing took place before DJ(MC) Coleman on 18 July 2016. Extradition was ordered and the appellant was removed to Croatia on 27 January 2017. In the course of her decision DJ(MC) Coleman found that the appellant was a fugitive and had left Croatia fully aware that he was facing these criminal proceedings.
Following extradition the appellant stood trial in Croatia and disputed the charges. He was convicted and sentenced  whilst at court. It seems that he was released on bail and then summoned to prison to serve his sentence on 14 October 2021. He failed to respond to the summons and applied for a postponement. That application was refused and a further summons for him to attend prison was issued but he did not present himself, leading to the issuing of the AW. The appellant was arrested on 21 June 2022 and was produced at Westminster Magistrates’ Court the same day and granted bail. The final hearing before DJ(MC) Clews took place on 11 January 2023 .
Before the judge, the appellant raised the sole issue of Article 8 of the ECHR. Having considered the evidence of the appellant the judge concluded that he was a fugitive. He observed as follows:
Factual findings: The principle issue is fugitivity. The RP agreed he left Croatia after his convictions but before his sentence. He may not have been prohibited from leaving but that does not prevent him being a fugitive. It is highly likely he anticipated a custodial sentence and did not wish to serve it. Leaving in those circumstances entitles me to find he is a fugitive, Ristin v Romania [2022] EWHC 3163 (Admin). It seems to me the only sensible conclusion that I can draw from the timing of his departure is that he wished to put himself beyond the reach of the Croatian authorities and did so. In the circumstances I am sure, to the criminal standard, he is a fugitive as per Wisniewski v Poland.
It is difficult, if not impossible, to accept, without corroboration, the RP’s assertion he was assaulted in Croatia and that his life was in danger there.
Further, Mr Barrowcliffe is justified in making his submission that the information I have been supplied with does no more than establish the RP made an application to the Constitutional Court in Croatia, it does not establish there are ongoing proceedings there. If that was the case I would have expected to see more by way of documentation establishing that fact.”
The appellant gave evidence at the hearing before the judge and explained that he was currently employed by The Little Way Association, which is a registered charity, and he worked as a caretaker. He was supported by his friend Ms Grcar who lives and works alongside him and who wrote a letter for the purposes of the hearing explaining that the appellant was a key member of the team which supported the charitable work of the association, and that he had been elected to the executive committee. He had in recent times had back problems which were being investigated and he had had an examination at hospital but the results in relation to that were still expected. In cross-examination the appellant confirmed that he is a single, divorced man with three adult children who do not live with him. He explained that his employment in the UK was central to his life. The appellant’s medical records were produced for the hearing and they demonstrated that he had been investigated for his back pain and that the diagnosis was multilevel degeneration which would be best managed by exercise, physiotherapy and pain management.
In accordance with the approach endorsed by Poland v Celinski [2015] EWCA 1274 the judge set out the balance sheet of the factors for and against extradition in the appellant’s case. The judge then set out his conclusions in relation to the Article 8 ground as follows.
Discussion of Article 8: I take account of the RP’s state of health but any ailment or difficulty the RP has is relatively minor, not unusual for a man of his age and can be adequately managed by medication. It does not appear that he is likely to undergo surgery.
Apart from the period when he was previously extradited he has been in the UK for a significant period and in that time he has built a life for himself here. However, in view of his circumstances there would be very limited interference with his, or anyone else’s Article 8 rights if he was to be extradited. Certainly it is impossible to say that such interference will be at a high level, or exceptional.
The offences of which he was convicted are serious and amount to a fraud totalling the equivalent of around £250,000 and there is no doubt the public interest in this case is, and remains, high. In those circumstances any counterbalancing factors would have to be truly compelling in order for the public interest to be outweighed by Article 8 considerations.
It is unfortunate that the RP is being sought by Croatia for the second time. However, at the time of his previous extradition he had not been convicted of these offences. That cannot, in itself, be something that amounts to the RP’s extradition being oppressive or disproportionate. If anything it heightens the public interest. The RP must have known or realised that Croatia would seek his extradition a second time if he failed to serve his sentence.
Mr Brazell submits that Croatia could and should have investigated these matters more diligently and more swiftly but I simply do not have the information to be able to conclude they could, or indeed should, have done so. Often financial investigations are necessarily lengthy, involved and painstaking. With the seriousness of the allegations I cannot find the public interest has diminished to any meaningful extent due to any passage of time. It remains high and particularly so in the light of my finding the RP is a fugitive.
I have been provided with a copy of Judge Coleman’s judgement from July 2016 and whilst her findings are certainly not binding upon me, she found that the RP was a fugitive and that the Article 8 balance was, at that time, in favour of extradition. Of course, I acknowledge the circumstances surrounding the finding of fugitivity on that occasion were different but those findings, particularly on the Article 8 issue, serve to reinforce my own conclusions, which I make clear I have arrived at independently.
I cannot say that such interference as there would be outweighs the very strong public interest in extradition. Additionally, as I have said, the UK cannot be seen as a safe haven for those who are wanted by other Convention signatories to stand trial or serve sentences for serious offences. Accordingly, I cannot decline to extradite the RP on Article 8 grounds.”
The judge ordered the appellant’s extradition. The appellant appealed initially on the basis that the judge’s assessment of fugitivity and the balance to be struck under Article 8 was wrong. Permission was refused on this single ground by the single judge. The appellant renewed the application for permission to appeal, and then on 15 March 2024 applied for permission to amend the grounds of appeal at the renewal hearing to include a new ground based upon Article 3. On 20 June 2024 Sir Peter Lane sitting as a judge of the High Court granted permission to amend the grounds to include the arguments in relation to Article 3 and granted permission to appeal on both the Article 3 and Article 8 grounds.
The appellant applies to adduce fresh evidence in relation to the Article 3 ground principally on the basis that the two key pieces of evidence upon which the appellant relies were not available at the time of the hearing. The first piece of evidence is the decision of the European Court of Human Rights (“ECtHR”) in the case of Vukusic v Croatia (37522/16) which was not published until 14 November 2023. The second piece of evidence upon which the appellant relies is the “Report to the Croatian Government on the visit to Croatia carried out by the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhumane or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CPT) from 19th to 29th of September 2022” which was published on 23 November 2023 (“the Report”). It was agreed that the court could examine this material without prejudice to the question of whether or not it was admissible in order to determine both the application to accept this fresh evidence and also the merits of this ground.
The case of Vukusic related to the conditions in which Mr Vukusic was held in the Diagnostic Centre in Zagreb prison between February 2012 and January 2013. It was accepted by the Croatian authorities that the claimant had at his disposal as little as 2.79 m² of personal space whilst held in this facility. The Croatian authorities also accepted that he had as little as 2.9 m² of personal space whilst he was housed at Split prison. These findings are recorded at paragraphs 47 and 48 of the judgement respectively. The court went on to undertake its assessment applying the principles established in the case of Mursic v Croatia (7334/13), noting that a serious lack of space in a prison cell weighed heavily as a factor to be taken into account for the purpose of establishing whether detention conditions were “degrading” from the perspective of Article 3. The court concluded as follows.
The Court notes that in Zagreb Prison the applicant had less than 3 m² of personal space for at least 152 days out of his 432 day detention there… The same holds true as regards at least part of his stay in Split Prison, where he was detained for 193 days…
The Court has previously found violations in respect of issues similar to those in the present case (see Mursic, cited above, [151-153]; Ulemek cited above [127-131]; and Lonic v Croatia (8067/12) [74-78] 4 December 2014). Having examined all the material submitted to it, the Court has not found any fact or argument capable of persuading it to reach a different conclusion on the merits of this complaint in the present case.
There has accordingly been a violation of Article 3 of the Convention as regards the applicant’s conditions of detention in Zagreb Prison and Split Prison.”
The Report observes that at the time of the visit undertaken by the CPT in September 2022 there had been a significant increase in the prison population since the last visit in 2017 and noted that at the time of the visit the overall occupancy rate in the prison estate was 107%. At paragraph 29 of the Report it is noted that overall “prison overcrowding remains a serious problem in the Croatian penitentiary system, particularly in pre-trial detention and closed regime units.” In particular, in relation to Zagreb Prison the report observed as follows.
“Zagreb Prison, located in the Remetinec neighbourhood, consisted of a three-story complex with 10 departments. At the time of the visit, it was holding a total of 834 prisoners (501 remand prisoners, 159 convicted prisoners and 14 for misdemeanour offences) for a capacity of 552 places (representing an occupancy rate of 151%). In particular, the pre-trial population had practically doubled since the CPT’s visit in 2017, when it stood at 251 prisoners. Of the current 834 prisoners, 34 were women (including 14 sentenced) located in department number 10 and 120 detainees were in the National Diagnostic Centre (NDC) (Department number five), which formally has a separate director and management.”
Paragraph 40 of the Report notes that there had been improvements introduced since the previous visit of the CPT, but that nonetheless all of the wings accommodating remand prisoners, namely departments 1 to 6, were seriously overcrowded and, in principle, the standard cells of 19.5 m² accommodating between six and eight prisoners for 22 hours per day meant that most of the remand population was offered a living space between 2.5 and 3.2 m² each. This led to the CPT recommending that the Croatian authorities insured that no more than four remand prisoners were accommodated in a single multiple-occupancy cell at Zagreb Prison. They further required rigorous action to put an end to overcrowding in the prison estate.
The Report provided particular focus in relation to the National Diagnostic Centre in Zagreb Prison. Paragraph 43 of the Report provides as follows.
The condition in the 18 cells of the National Diagnostic Centre (namely, Department number five), were worse than the rest of Zagreb Prison, with higher occupancy levels (eight prisoners accommodated in 19.5 m²) and a poor state of repair and hygiene. The CPT recommends that the conditions of detention at the National Diagnostic Centre (Department number five) of Zagreb Prison be substantially improved in terms of state of repair and level of hygiene in cells and that occupancy levels be reduced to meet the required standard.”
In a footnote to this paragraph it is noted that prisoners were in principle spending 30 days and more in such conditions and the management tried to transfer prisoners to other wings when occupancy levels in the cells reached eight persons. The Report noted that it was not surprising that the majority of complaints raised by detained persons related to the levels of overcrowding and poor material conditions in the cells.
The Croatian government provided a response (“the Response”) to the Report dealing specifically with the points which have been raised by the  CPT. So far as the material conditions in the prison estate were concerned the Response stated that the past three years had been extremely challenging for Croatia’s penitentiary system due to the consequences of the Covid pandemic, as well as natural disasters such as earthquakes which had led to prisons needing to be evacuated and inmates rehoused. The response observed that the Ministry of Justice and Public Administration was continually striving to address the problem of prison overcrowding and improve the conditions of detention for those on remand and serving a sentence.
The Response rehearses a number of projects devised to secure additional capacity within the prison estate including longer term plans for the refurbishment of Zagreb Prison. In this connection the Response advised as follows.
As indicated in the replies to points 38, 40, 41 and 42 of the report, long-term plans will certainly include the refurbishment of Zagreb Prison, which is being prepared by all competent services. Since the National Diagnostic Centre in Zagreb is located in the same building, these adaptation plans apply equally to that organisational unit as well. Until this comprehensive refurbishment, the Ministry of Justice and Public Administration will provide (at the Centre’s request) the resources for minor adaptations and maintenance, such as those undertaken in the accommodation units of the same building under the responsibility of Zagreb Prison. Furthermore, the adoption of new Indicative benchmarks for referral and allocation of prisoners executing prison sanctions, the introduction of assessment forms and tools, as well as the reorganisation of the assessment system currently carried out at the National Diagnostic Centre, will speed up the assessment process and the referral to sentence execution in penitentiaries and prisons, which will relieve the overcrowding at the Centre.
As stated in the reply to points 38, 40, 41 and 42, the Ministry of Justice and Public Administration is aware of the need to respect the requirement of a minimum space of 4 m² per prisoner, i.e. the need to provide compensatory measures in cases where overcrowding does not allow this standard to be met for a certain period of time. The Committees report will be made available to the Supreme Court and to the courts responsible for executing prison sentences, including the supervisory judges responsible for Zagreb Prison (the Velika Gorica County Court). The issue of deciding on complaints from prisoners will also be discussed at regular annual meeting of supervisory judges, in which representatives of the Directorate for the Prison System and Probation also participate.”
In the light of the appellant’s medical history, on his behalf attention is drawn to passages in the Report which note that within Zagreb Prison Hospital there have been allegations of physical-ill-treatment of patients and “appalling conditions and neglect” were noted in relation to some psychiatric patients. As to other healthcare issues, the Report noted as follows.
The healthcare staffing complement at Zagreb Prison included several vacancies and currently consisted of the following members: one full-time GP, three contracted part-time GPs (a neurologist, a traumatologist and an orthopaedic surgeon for a total presence of 360 hours per month), to contracted part-time psychiatrists (for a total presence of 180 hours per month), eight nurses (at least three per shift and two weekends) and one pharmacy technician. Although a general practitioner was always present in the prison, including during weekends, such a component seemed rather insufficient for a large remand prison.”
In the Response it is noted that in 2022 Zagreb Prison was authorised to recruit a medical doctor but the position was not filled because no person applied; the prison was, however, able to recruit one nurse/medical technician as a result of the competition.
Article 3 and fresh evidence
The test for the court to apply when considering whether an appellant can succeed under Article 3 is whether it has been shown that there are substantial grounds for believing that the appellant would face a real risk of being subjected to torture or inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment in the receiving country. If this test is satisfied there is an obligation under Article 3 not to extradite the appellant to the receiving country. This principle, and other general principles pertaining to Article 3 are set out in Elashmawy v Italy [2015] EWHC 28 at paragraph 49.
The context for the consideration of prospective violations caused by detention conditions was set out by the ECtHR in the case of Mursic v Croatia [2017]65 EHRR 1 in which they set out the principles as follows.
In the light of the considerations set out above, the Court confirms the standard predominant in its case-law of 3m² of floor surface per detainee in multi-occupancy accommodation as the relevant minimum standard under art.3 of the Convention.
When the personal space available to a detainee falls below 3m² of floor surface in multi-occupancy accommodation in prisons, the lack of personal space is considered so severe that a strong presumption of a violation of art.3 arises. The burden of proof is on the respondent Government which could, however, rebut that presumption by demonstrating that there were factors capable of adequately compensating for the scarce allocation of personal space.
The strong presumption of a violation of art.3 will normally be capable of being rebutted only if the following factors are cumulatively met:
the reductions in the required minimum personal space of 3m² are short, occasional and minor;
such reductions are accompanied by sufficient freedom of movement outside the cell and adequate out-of-cell activities; and
the Appellant is confined in what is, when viewed generally, an appropriate detention facility, and there are no other aggravating aspects of the conditions of his or her detention.
In cases where a prison cell – measuring in the range of 3-4m² of personal space per inmate – is at issue the space factor remains a weighty factor in the Court's assessment of the adequacy of conditions of detention. In such instances a violation of art.3 will be found if the space factor is coupled with other aspects of inappropriate physical conditions of detention related to, in particular, access to outdoor exercise, natural light or air, availability of ventilation, adequacy of room temperature, the possibility of using the toilet in private, and compliance with basic sanitary and hygienic requirements.
The Court also stresses that in cases where a detainee disposed of more than 4m² of personal space in multi-occupancy accommodation in prison and where therefore no issue with regard to the question of personal space arises, other aspects of physical conditions of detention referred to above remain relevant for the Court's assessment of adequacy of an Appellant's conditions of detention under art.3 of the Convention.
Lastly, the Court would emphasise the importance of the CPT's preventive role in monitoring conditions of detention and of the standards which it develops in that connection. The Court reiterates that when deciding cases concerning conditions of detention it remains attentive to those standards and to the Contracting States' observance of them.”
The appellant accepts that there is a general presumption that where a state is a member of the Council of Europe it will comply with its international obligations including those required by Article 3 of the ECHR. In Jane v Prosecutor General’s Office, Lithuania [2018] EWHC 1122, the Divisional Court indicated in the judgment of Dingemans J (with which Hickinbottom LJ agreed) that the position could be expressed as follows.
Because of the principle of mutual trust between member states, membership of the Council of Europe is a highly relevant factor in deciding whether an extradited person would, in fact, be likely to suffer treatment contrary to article 3 if extradited to another member state, see Targosinski v Poland [2011] EWHC 312 (Admin) at paragraph 5. There is a general presumption that a member state will comply with its international obligations, including those arising from article 3 of the ECHR. That presumption may be rebutted be clear, cogent and compelling evidence, something approaching an international consensus, see Krolik v Poland [2012] EWHC 2357; [2013] 1 WLR 490 at paragraph 3. For example, if there has been a pilot judgment of the European Court of Human Rights (“ECtHR”) against the requesting state identifying structural or systemic problems the presumption will be rebutted. Such judgments have recently been issued against states including Italy and the Russian Federation. Where the presumption is rebutted, the burden of proof shifts to the requesting state, which must, on the basis of clear and cogent evidence, satisfy the court that, in the case of the requested person, extradition will not result in a real risk of inhuman or degrading treatment.”
In the event that the court is satisfied that the evidence rebuts the presumption that applies to a state that is a contracting party to the ECHR to the requisite standard, then the correct approach is to seek further information from the Requesting Authority in order to ascertain whether the risk which has been identified still exists or whether it can be resolved. This procedure flows from the decision of the European Court of Justice in Aranyosi and Caldararu v Generalstaatsanwaltschaft Bremen [2016] 3 CMLR 13. In a domestic context the correct approach was set out in paragraph 30 of Visha v Italy [2019] EWHC 400 in the following analysis..
“The approach to be taken in EAW cases where the executing court determines on the evidence that there is a real risk of a breach was set out in Aranyosi from which the following key points can be derived:
where an executing member state is in possession of evidence of a real risk of inhuman and degrading treatment for those returned to a requesting state an assessment of the risk must be made such that return does not result in inhuman and degrading treatment;
the executing member state must initially rely on information that is objective, reliable specific and properly updated on the detention conditions prevailing in the issuing member state and that demonstrates that there are deficiencies which may be systemic or generalised or which may affect certain groups of people or which may affect certain places of detention;
however, a finding that there is a real risk of a breach of Article 3 in a requesting state as a result of the general conditions of detention cannot lead in itself to the refusal to execute a European arrest warrant;
the key issue is whether there are substantial grounds to believe in the case of a specific person before the court that there is a risk of an Article 3 breach;
should such substantial grounds exist, the requested state must, pursuant to Article 15(2) of the Framework Decision, urgently request supplementary information as to the conditions the requested person will be detained in upon return;
the request for information may include inquiries regarding national or international procedures in existence for monitoring detention conditions which make it possible for them to be assessed;
a time limit may be fixed for a reply taking into account the need to observe the time limit set down in Article 17 of the Framework Decision;
if, in light of the information provided, it is still found that a real risk of inhuman treatment exists then the extradition request must be postponed but it cannot be abandoned;
where a request for further information has been made, the executing judicial authority must postpone its decision on the surrender of the individual concerned until it obtains the supplementary information that allows it to discount the existence of such a risk. If the existence of that risk cannot be discounted within a reasonable time, the executing judicial authority must decide whether the surrender procedure should be brought to an end.”
The appellant submits that, in accordance with the principles established in the case of Hungary v Fenyvesi [2009] EWHC 321 (Admin), the material in the form of the decision of the European Court of Human Rights in Vukusic and the Report should be admitted, firstly, because they post-date the decision of the judge and therefore could not have been relied upon at the time of the hearing on 2023-January-11, and secondly, because they are decisive in relation to the Article 3 arguments which the appellant advances. The first point is not disputed; the second point is the subject of contention.
The appellant contends that it is clear from the evidence that, upon return, he will be held at the Centre for Diagnostics in Zagreb Prison which has been the subject of significant criticism in both Vukusic and the Report. The grounds for concluding that the appellant would be held there are threefold. Firstly, the court in which the appellant was convicted was in Zagreb. Secondly, the conduct which is the source of the convictions occurred in Zagreb. Finally, the terms of the AW itself spell out on page 10 of the document, in relation to other circumstances relevant to the case, that “upon surrender of Andelko Mihelic he is to be escorted to the Centre for Diagnostics Zagreb, Zagreb”.
On the basis that the appellant will be held at the Centre for Diagnostics in Zagreb Prison the appellant contends that it is clear from the new evidence that there is a real risk of a breach of his Article 3 rights. This arises on the basis of the findings of the court in Vukusic which comprise a finding that in the light of the conditions in which Mr Vukusic was held at the Diagnostic Centre and in Zagreb Prison there was in his case a breach of Article 3 as a result of the overcrowding in the facility. The evidence from the Report shows that in the Diagnostics Centre eight prisoners are being held in cells which are merely 19.5 square meters, leading to available space per prisoner of only 2.43 square meters.
Whilst the appellant accepts that these findings relate to the position some time ago, the appellant contends that the recent findings of the Report demonstrate that there has been no improvement in the conditions since then and similar breaches of Article 3 arise. This conclusion is based on a source of evidence, in the form of the Report from CPT, which is recognised as authoritative in Aranyosi at paragraph 89 in which the judgment provided guidance as follows.
To that end, the executing judicial authority must, initially, rely on information that is objective, reliable, specific and properly updated on the detention conditions prevailing in the issuing Member State and that demonstrates that there are deficiencies, which may be systemic or generalised, or which may affect certain groups of people, or which may affect certain places of detention. That information may be obtained from, inter alia, judgments of international courts, such as judgments of the ECtHR, judgments of courts of the issuing Member State, and also decisions, reports and other documents produced by bodies of the Council of Europe or under the aegis of the UN.”
Furthermore, reliant upon this passage the appellant submits that the evidence is directly relevant to a particular place of detention, namely Zagreb Prison and more particularly still, the Diagnostics Centre there. Whilst the Response attempts to provide reassurance the reality is that its assertions are purely prospective, unspecific and do not provide any basis to conclude that the conditions which have been previously condemned in both Vukusic and the Report have been rectified.
The appellant also relies upon the reported conditions relating to the health care within Zagreb Prison on the basis that the appellant has complex health needs. Medical documentation records that the appellant suffers from positional vertigo and nerve damage, which affects his balance and mobility. In addition he has weakness in his lower legs caused by protracted degenerative disease including arthritis impacting on his spine. These conditions could not, it is submitted, be adequately treated and supported in Zagreb Prison given the poor condition of the medical facilities and the lack of qualified staff.
In response to these submissions the respondent contends that the evidence which the appellant relies upon is not sufficient to support a finding of a breach of Article 3. The material does not demonstrate that there has been a systemic failure in the prisons in Croatia and that there are widespread problems. This is particularly the case when considering the difficulties which the prison system in Croatia has had to contend with in the form of natural disasters and the Covid pandemic.
The evidence which the court relied upon in the case of Vukusic is now many years old and out of date. The evidence from the Report relates to the circumstances two years ago and the CPT did not suggest in the Report that the conditions in Zagreb Prison amounted to a breach of Article 3. Even at the time of the Report such overcrowding as was identified in the prison estate as a whole was marginal in extent. The respondent disputed that the appellant would be bound to be held in the Diagnostics Centre in Zagreb Prison: where the crime was committed and the court in which the requested person was convicted did not determine where they would be detained to serve their sentence. In any event, the principle difficulties in relation to overcrowding that the Report noted was in respect of remand prisoners and not the conditions of prisoners who had been convicted. Further, the report noted in respect of the Diagnostic Centre (as set out above) that prisoners “were in principle spending 30 days and more in such conditions and the management tried to transfer prisoners to other wings when occupancy levels in the cells reached eight persons”.
The respondent relied upon the Response to demonstrate that there was a clear commitment to address any failings at the Diagnostic Centre in Zagreb Prison. Active steps were being contemplated to alleviate overcrowding and meet the concerns raised in the Report. There was no reason to consider that the position was still the same now as had pertained at the time of the Report.
In relation to the points taken with respect to healthcare at the prison the respondent observes that the Report notes that there was a GP on duty at all times in Zagreb Prison and that there were also nurses constantly available. The pharmacy was well stocked and there were systems in place to ensure prompt and confidential access to a doctor. Given the nature of the appellant’s conditions and the evidence provided by the Report there was no basis for any realistic concerns that the appellant’s health could not be adequately and properly supported whilst he was held at the prison to serve his sentence.
Article 8
The appellant claims that the judge was in error when making a finding that the appellant was a fugitive. Firstly, in the Further Information which was provided by the respondent, it was noted that the appellant was held in pre-trial detention from the time he arrived in Croatia, having been earlier extradited on an accusation warrant in relation to these charges. On the 2018-June-5 the court rendered its non-final verdict by which he was sentenced to 2 years and 10 months imprisonment. Pre-trial detention was terminated on the basis that it was considered that the appellant would continue to be available to the court. The appellant was not under restriction. On the 2021-October-14 he was instructed by the court to report to the Diagnostic Centre in Zagreb and he filed a request for a postponement on the basis of ill-health but this application was rejected and he was instructed to attend and serve his sentence on 2021-November-25 but he never reported to either the court or the prison.
In his witness statement for the hearing before the judge the appellant states that he left Croatia at a time when the judicial authorities were aware of his residential address and phone number in this jurisdiction. Applications had been made to the Constitutional Court in Croatia in respect of his case and these remained outstanding at the time of completing the witness statement. When the appellant gave evidence at the hearing before the judge he reiterated these points and explained that he was still in contact with his Croatian lawyer and that he had been advised that the case would take two to three years to resolve.
The judge’s conclusions of fact in relation to the appellant’s case, and in particular whether the appellant was a fugitive, were set out in paragraphs 27 to 29 which have been set out above. At paragraphs 38 and 39 of the judgment the judge set out the factors in favour and against ordering the extradition of the appellant. The judge noted in his discussion of the Article 8 issues that there would be very limited interference with either the appellant’s or anyone else’s Article 8 rights if he were to be extradited: the interference would not be at a high level or exceptional. The offences for which the appellant was sought were serious and the fact that the appellant was being extradited for the second time, following his extradition to be tried for the offences, heightened the public interest in his extradition and reinforced that the appellant must have known or realised that his return would be sought if he failed to present himself to serve his sentence. The judge was unable to accept the submission that the offences ought to have been investigated more promptly as there was no evidence to support this suggestion. The judge took account of his finding that the appellant was a fugitive as a factor in support of the grant of extradition alongside the concern that the UK should not be seen as a safe haven for those who are wanted in other jurisdictions to serve sentences for serious offences, as in the present case. In short, the judge found that the balance favoured ordering the extradition of the appellant. The ultimate conclusions of the judge were set out in paragraphs 40 to 49 which have been quoted earlier in this judgment.
In support of the submissions that the judge was wrong to find that the appellant was a fugitive reliance is placed upon the case of Ristin v Romania [2022] EWHC 3163, which had been referred to by the judge. In paragraph 29 of his judgment Fordham J distilled the conclusions of the three leading cases addressing in what circumstances a person can properly be regarded as a fugitive in the following terms:
I will describe the three cases in the trilogy. Wisniewski was a case about suspended sentences and their subsequent activation. The requested persons were found to have left the requesting state in circumstances which involved their knowingly preventing compliance with the conditions of extant suspended sentences. Specifically, that was because they left in breach of a condition requiring notification of an address (paras 64 and 69) and other conditions (para 66). The Divisional Court decided that they left as “fugitives” notwithstanding that they only became “unlawfully at large” later when the suspended sentences were activated (para 53). Pillar-Neumann was a case about declining to answer a summons to travel to, and appear in, the requesting state. The requested person had been in the UK when they first became aware of the legal proceedings against them in the requesting state. They had chosen to remain here and subsequently resisted extradition. The Divisional Court decided that this conduct did not constitute them a fugitive. They were not “evading arrest” (para 68) or knowingly placing themselves beyond the reach of legal process (para 70). Were it otherwise, the logic would appear to be that any requested person not submitting to arrest, by returning to the requesting state, would be a fugitive (para 72). De Zorsi was a case about returning home with permission to leave. The requested person’s action in leaving France was “simply returning home” (para 57), “with the permission of the court” (para 55). The Divisional Court concluded that they could not in law be regarded as a “fugitive”. The requested person had been in court at her trial in France in 2001 (para 50), had then returned home to the Netherlands after being told by the court that she was “free to leave France” (para 50), had been notified of her conviction and sentence (para 57), and unsuccessfully appealed (para 58), and had refused to answer the summons of the French court (para 59 to 60). All three of these cases recognise the core principle which asks whether the requested person  has acted knowingly to place themselves beyond the reach of the legal process (Wisniewski para 59, Pillar-Neumann para 62, 64 De Zorski para 46ii).”
The appellant particularly emphasises the findings in the case of Pillar-Neumann at paragraphs 64 to 69 of the judgment of Hamblen LJ (as he then was). These paragraphs stress that it is not possible to be a passive fugitive and that where, as in the circumstances of that case, the requested person has been living openly in the UK and subsequently proceedings are issued in the requesting jurisdiction there is no obligation upon that person to return to the jurisdiction and make themselves available to the judicial process or to serve a sentence. In those circumstances the person was not fleeing the requesting jurisdiction or taking steps to evade or avoid the judicial process. Nor had the person knowingly placed themselves beyond the reach of the judicial process. These characteristics were reflected in the appellant’s case and the judge had been wrong to conclude he was a fugitive. The Croatian authorities knew where the appellant was and his appeal to the Constitutional Court reflected his continued involvement in the judicial process in Croatia. He had been corresponded with in relation to reporting to serve his sentence. His circumstances did not, therefore, have the qualities of fugitivity as identified in the authorities.
In addition to these points, the appellant draws attention to the fact that he has been the subject of an electronic curfew for two years and nine months whilst awaiting the outcome of these extradition proceedings and that he is, as set out above, subject to medical conditions affecting his quality of life. The offending with which these proceedings are concerned occurred many years ago. In the light of all of these factors the balance in the appellant’s case should be recast in his favour.
These submissions are resisted by the respondent who emphasises that this is the second time that the appellant has been the subject of extradition proceedings and that he was present when he was convicted and sentenced, but had nonetheless decided to leave Croatia before serving his sentence. Having sought to have his imprisonment postponed the applicant was fully aware that the application for postponement had been refused. The application contained in the documents supporting the appellant’s case and relating to his appeal to the Constitutional Court are inconclusive and of very limited value to the appellant. The reality was that the appellant had taken the deliberate step to put himself beyond the reach of the Croatian authorities and the judge was correct to conclude that he was a fugitive.
Turning to the other factors relied upon, the respondent submits that the judge was correct to conclude that there is nothing in the information about the appellant’s medical condition which is unusual for a person of his age or which could not be addressed in a custodial environment. The fact that he had been subject to bail conditions was simply a reflection of the fact that he had demonstrated himself to be a flight risk and therefore these measures were required as a result of his previous behaviour. The delays in the case had been caused by the appellant absconding from Croatia. Ultimately, the appellant has very limited Article 8 rights and thus the conclusions of the judge were entirely appropriate.
Conclusions
Having considered the submissions made by the parties on both grounds, this judgment deals first by assessing the merits of the case made by the appellant in respect of Article 8. The principal feature which the appellant relies upon is the concern in relation to the judge’s finding that the appellant was a fugitive. As is clear from the analysis of the authorities in Ristin set out above, the core question is whether having regard to the specific facts of this case the appellant acted knowingly to place himself beyond the reach of the legal process, in this case the execution of the sentence which had been passed upon him, in Croatia.
The circumstances of this case demonstrate, firstly, that the appellant was fully familiar with the extradition process, having previously been extradited for the purposes of his trial. Having been returned to Croatia and placed in pre-trial detention the appellant was then tried and convicted of the offences with which these proceedings are concerned. He was present for his trial, conviction and sentence. He was certainly aware of the sentence which had been passed and that, notwithstanding the time which he had spent on remand awaiting trial, there was still a balance of the sentence which was imposed to serve.
Whilst he was not the subject of restriction and the Croatian authorities were aware of his UK address, he nonetheless chose to move back to the UK at a time when he knew that a sentence was required to be served in Croatia since it had been imposed upon him in person. As Fordham J observed in paragraph 30 of Ristin the notion in De Zorzi of having left “with the permission of the court” (see paragraph 55 of De Zorzi) is distinct from simply the absence of a restriction on leaving the country. The key factual question is whether the actions of the appellant have the hallmarks of knowing and evasive relocation.
In my view the judge was not wrong to conclude that on the facts of this case the appellant was a fugitive. As noted, he was present when convicted and sentenced and fully aware that there was additional time to serve in his case, subject only to an appeal to the Constitutional Court which did not suspend or impact upon the validity of the sentence for which he is wanted. The reality is that the appellant chose to come to the UK knowing he had that sentence to serve, and sought to pursue his application to the Constitutional Court from abroad. His knowledge of the continuing liability to serve the sentence in this case was reinforced by his unsuccessful attempt to postpone the requirement to report to serve the sentence. In my view the judge was entitled to conclude that the appellant’s conduct in leaving Croatia after being in court when convicted and sentenced could be properly characterised as a knowing attempt to evade his liabilities for these offences, and therefore he was not wrong to identify the appellant as a fugitive on the facts of this case. The facts of this case are far removed from those in Pillar-Neumann and De Zorzi, and much closer to those in Ristin.
In my view the judge’s conclusions on the appellant’s Article 8 case were robust and accurate. The starting point must be an examination of the nature and quality of the appellant’s Article 8 rights in the UK. The appellant has no family life in the UK; he has a private life which he enjoys with friends and those with whom he works. The judge was therefore right to observe that these rights are not such as to carry significant weight in the Article 8 balance when compared, for instance, to the public interest in the UK complying with its international obligations and avoiding becoming a safe haven for criminals.
Whilst the appellant’s medical conditions and the fact that he has been on an electronically monitored curfew for a significant period of time are all to be brought into account they were reflected in the balancing exercise which the judge undertook. Similar observations can be made in relation to the length of time that the appellant has spent in the UK without any criminal convictions: these are matters which should be and were reflected in the Article 8 balance. These factors are not, however, matters which in my judgment carry any more than little relative weight in the determination of the merits of the appellant’s case. Overall, the balance which the judge struck was accurate and this ground of the appeal must fail.
Turning to the appellant’s case under Article 3 the starting point is the presumption that the authorities in Croatia, as a contracting party to the ECHR, will abide by their obligations to respect the Article 3 rights of the appellant. The issue is whether, on the evidence and in accordance with the authorities, there is clear cogent and compelling evidence from an authoritative source that the presumption is rebutted and there are substantial grounds to believe that there is a real risk that this appellant’s Article 3 rights will be breached.
In addressing these issues in respect of this appellant the first point is the question of where the evidence suggests he will be held upon his return to Croatia. This is because the focus of the appellant’s case is not a systemic  or generalised failure of the Croatian prison system but rather the conditions which have been recorded in Zagreb Prison and, still more particularly, the conditions in the Diagnostic Centre at that prison. The authorities are clear that the court should consider not only deficiencies which are systemic and generalised but also those which may affect certain groups of people or certain places of detention. The appellant is therefore entitled to focus in the way in which he does upon the evidence related to Zagreb Prison and the Diagnostic Centre it includes.
Whilst the respondent has submitted that it is not for certain that the appellant would be held at the Diagnostic Centre at Zagreb Prison, it seems to me that the evidence all points to it being the clear intention of the respondent to initially house the appellant in that facility. The three points relied upon by the appellant to prove that this is the intention, in particular the terms of the AW, are strongly probative. It also appears to me to be reinforced by the summons to prison referred to in the Further Information which required the appellant to report to the Diagnostic Centre. Although this has been the basis of the appellant’s case since the grant of permission to pursue this ground, no information has been furnished by the respondent to gainsay what is in my view a clearly articulated intention, namely that it is intended that the appellant will, upon return, be held at the Diagnostic Centre in Zagreb Prison.
The question which then arises is whether, in the light of that finding, the court can be sure that he would face a real risk of a breach of Article 3 as a consequence of detention. Whilst the respondent is entitled to make the point that the findings in the case of Vukusic are now of some age, the difficulty for the respondent is that it does not appear on the evidence that there has been any material improvement in the circumstances at that facility since those findings were made. Indeed nowhere in the evidence is it suggested that there were improvements made after 2013 but prior to the deficiencies identified in the Report. The authors of the Report are a body of the Council of Europe and therefore an authoritative source of evidence in relation to the conditions in the Diagnostic Centre, and it is clear from the Report that there are significant and persistent problems of overcrowding in that facility. The Report provides evidence that the cells of the facility are occupied to an extent which breaches the space requirements needed to satisfy Article 3, and this deficiency is implicitly acknowledged in the Response which recognises the acute need for change in the conditions at that facility.
Although the respondent relies upon the content of the Response to the Report, in my view the appellant is entitled to observe that the contents of the Response in relation to Zagreb Prison are entirely aspirational, without any clear timescales, and without any evidence of what changes have been made to address the unacceptable overcrowding and poor state of repair and hygiene, in particular in the Diagnostic Centre, and with what tangible impact upon the conditions in which prisoners are detained. The observations in footnote 43 to which the respondent draws attention are of no comfort in relation to these concerns. It refers to prisoners spending “30 days and more” in the Diagnostic Centre’s overcrowded, poorly maintained and unhygienic cells, with no assurance as to resolution of the evident problems. Against this background in my view there is clear and compelling evidence which rebuts the presumption in this case based on the breach of the Article 3 rights of the appellant upon his return and detention at the Diagnostic Centre at Zagreb Prison.
The are two consequential issues which arise as a result of these conclusions. The first is that I am satisfied that the fresh evidence in the form of the judgment of the ECtHR in Vukusic and the Report should be admitted for the purposes of the appeal. For the reasons which have been set out above they are, in my view, of decisive importance in the merits of the appeal related to Article 3. The second matter is that, in accordance with the authorities, it is essential for the court to provide the respondent with an opportunity to provide further or supplementary information to the court to persuade the court that the risk of treatment in breach of Article 3 can be discounted. This is the approach set out and endorsed, for instance, in the case of Jane at paragraphs 43 to 47. The appropriate course as a consequence of the findings in this judgment is for this appeal to be stayed for a period of 42 days from the date of the handing down of this judgment to permit the respondent to notify the appellant and the court of any assurance that it is prepared to give in this case, following which the matter will be restored to the list. I give permission to apply thereafter in relation to the wording of any assurance and also the final disposal of the appeal.

Information Rights
Between:
Adrian Neighbour
Appellant:
and
The Information Commissioner
Respondent:
Date and type of Hearing:  On the Papers on 16 January 2025.
Panel: Judge Kennedy KC,& SpecialistsKate Grimley Evans and Miriam Scott.
Date of Final Decision – 17 January 2025.
Promulgated: 21 January 2025.
Representation:
The Appellant: As a Litigant in person.
For the Respondent: Gemma Garvey of the ICO.
Result: – The Tribunal dismiss the Appeal.
REASONS
This appeal brought by Adrian Neighbour (“the Appellant”) under section 57 of the Freedom of Information Act 2000 (“FOIA”), is against his decision notice of 2 September 2024 Ref. IC-299663-P6P3 (“the Decision Notice” / “DN”).
The Appellant requested information from Thames Valley Police (TVP) regarding a misconduct in public office allegation. TVP relied on sections 30(3) and 40(5) to neither confirm nor deny (“NCND”) holding the requested information.
The Commissioner’s decision is that TVP was entitled to rely on section 30(3) to NCND holding the requested information.
Background:
On 25 January 2024, the Appellant wrote to the Chief Constable of Thames Valley Police (TVP) and requested the following files:
““I refer you [to] the lengthy correspondence bundle attached and, in this regard, hereby make a request under the FOI Act 2000 as follows:
In relation to the notifiable office [99/12- Misconduct in Public Office] made against the Leader (etal) of [public authority removed], I request all information held relating to the recorded decision of the Office of the Force's Crime Registrar following submission of further and better particulars (case law) dated 2nd and 2022-August-15; this to include the following points to prove:
Date and location;
While acting as a public officer
Wilfully and without reasonable excuse or justification;
Neglected to perform his or her duty or
Misconducted himself /herself …;
I request information relating to all correspondence/communication received by and sent from the Office of the Force’s Crime Registrar from/to the Office of the Chief Constable relating to the submission of further and better particulars (case law) dated 2nd and 2022-August-15.”
TVP responded on 31 January 2024 and explained it would neither confirm nor deny holding the requested information under section 40(5A) and (5B) of FOIA. Following an internal review, TVP wrote to the complainant on 26 March 2024. It stated that it was refusing the request under section 14(1) of FOIA.
On 11 April 2024, the Appellant complained to the Commissioner. During the Commissioner’s section 50 investigation, TVP informed the Commissioner that it no longer wished to rely on section 14(1) of FOIA. Alternatively, it sought to rely on sections 30(3) and 40(5A) and (5B) of FOIA.
On 2 September 2024, the Commissioner issued the DN now under appeal in which he determined that section 30(3) FOIA was engaged, and the public interest favoured maintaining the exemption.
On 7 September 2024, the Appellant lodged a Notice of Appeal with the Tribunal.
The Grounds of Appeal:
The Appellant’s grounds of appeal may be summarised as follows: -
Ground 1 - TVP has disclosed the initial recorded decision in a letter from the Crime Registrar to the Appellant dated 21 July 2022.
Ground 2 - The DN is inconsistent with the Police’s investigatory duties, the rights of a victim under the Home Office Recording Rules1 and section 3.2 of TVP’s Crime Recording Policy dated July 2021.
Ground 3 - The decision that confirmation or denial would hinder TVP performing its functions and protecting victims does not stand up to scrutiny the victim has associated rights under the Home Office Recording Rules.
Ground 4 - The Appellant argues that the public interest favours confirmation or denial in this case. He that the decision fails to address whether TVP has applied this exemption to “trump” its investigatory duties “shielding” the conduct of officers. He considers that the IC’s balancing exercise failed to take into account the wider public interest in transparency, accountability and integrity in relation to crime recording.
The Commissioner’s Response:
The Commissioner resists this appeal relying on theDN setting out his findings andthe reasons for those findings, and repeats the matters stated therein but further observes in respect of the Appellant’s Grounds 1, 2 and3 that the rights of a victim under the Home Office Recording Rules or a TVP policy are distinct and separate to information rights under FOIA. The Commissioner submits that confirmation or denial under FOIA is equivalent to confirmation or denial into the public domain. This requires distinct consideration to TVP communicatinginformation to a particular individual in respect of a complaint raised.In respect of Ground 4, the Commissioner took into account the Appellant’s submissions when preparing the DN and has further reviewed the Appellant’s grounds of appeal and the public interest arguments and remains of the view that the public interest favours maintaining the exemption in this case for the reasons set out in his DN and argues that the Appellant’s grounds of appeal do not disturb this.
The Applicable Law:
A person requesting information from a public authority has a right to be informed by the public authority whether it holds the information (s.1(1)(a) FOIA), and to have that information communicated to him, if the public authority holds it (s.1(1)(b) FOIA). However, those rights are subject to certain exemptions, set out in Part II of FOIA. The relevant exemption for the purposes of the appeal is section 30(3) FOIA.
Section 30 FOIA provides that:
Information held by a public authority is exempt information if it has at any time been held by the authority for the purposes of—
- any investigation which the public authority has a duty to conduct with a view to it being ascertained—
whether a person should be charged with an offence, or
whether a person charged with an offence is guilty of it,
any investigation which is conducted by the authority and in the circumstances may lead to a decision by the authority to institute criminal proceedings which the authority has power to conduct, or
any criminal proceedings which the authority has power to conduct.
Information held by a public authority is exempt information if—
it was obtained or recorded by the authority for the purposes of its functions relating to—
investigations falling within subsection (1)(a) or (b),
criminal proceedings which the authority has power to conduct,
investigations (other than investigations falling within subsection (1)(a) or (b)) which are conducted by the authority for any of the purposes specified in section 31(2) and either by virtue of Her Majesty’s prerogative or by virtue of powers conferred by or under any enactment, or
civil proceedings which are brought by or on behalf of the authority and arise out of such investigations, and
it relates to the obtaining of information from confidential sources.
The duty to confirm or deny does not arise in relation to information which is (or if it were held by the public authority would be) exempt information by virtue of subsection (1) or (2).”
Section 30(3) FOIA is subject to the public interest test under section 2(1)(b) FOIA. This states that a public authority does not have to confirm or deny if the information is held if :“in all the circumstances of the case, the public interest in maintaining the exclusion of the duty to confirm or deny outweighs the public interest in disclosing whether the public authority holds the information”.
In the Commissioner’s submission, none of the Appellant’s arguments are sufficient to alter his findings. The Commissioner submits that the Appellant’s grounds do not identify any error of law in the DN nor, he argues do they identify any incorrect exercise of the Commissioner’s discretion.
Conclusion:
The Tribunal are not persuaded that the Appellant has demonstrated either an error of Law in the DN, nor any error in the exercise of the discretion by the respondent in his consideration of the public interest test as applied - and we refer to Paragraph 11 above accepting and adopting as we do, the Commissioner’s reasoning.
We, like the Respondent, recognise the genuine and heartfelt concern the Appellant has in relation to transparency and accountability in the circumstances as he has raised them. However, disclosure under FOIA is to the world at large and parliament has recognised the significance of the release or disclosure of sensitive information and the public interest in the exemption as it has been applied by the public authority here. The other policies, options and obligations raised by the Appellant are not within our jurisdiction and do not relate to or result in the same effect as disclosure under FOIA. We have no doubt that the purpose envisaged under the exemption applied here is appropriate and properly engaged and further that it is on balance, in the public interest that it be relied upon in all the circumstances of this case. Accordingly, we unanimously dismiss this appeal.

Sitting in Chambers on 7 August 2024 and 24 January 2025
Between

Appellant
and

Respondents
DECISION AND REASONS ON COSTS APPLICATION
1. The Appellant’s application for costs is refused.
2. We allowed the Appellant’s appeal against the Information Commissioner’s decision notice which had concluded that the Appellant’s request for information was vexatious.
3. The Appellant has now made an application for costs in relation to the appeal. His application for costs begins:-
….I have very recently come in to possession of entirely new testimony and evidence that proves that certainly the 2nd Respondent FCA have been guilty of ‘Unreasonable Behaviour’ [and indeed substantially worse behaviour] from the outset in respect to these FOIA requests and throughout these legal proceedings pursuant to them.
6. The evidence also rather demonstrates that the behaviour of the 1st Respondent, the Information Commissioner, was rather more than ‘regrettable’ and that it also was deliberately ‘Unreasonable behaviour’.
4. The Appellant lists the ‘new evidence and testimony’ and concludes that ‘It is now proven that EVERY allegation I have made in my complaints to the FCA in respect to my personal case since 2015 were true’.
5. He says that he submits ‘this application for costs against the 2nd and potentially the 1st Respondent for both ‘Wasted Costs’ and ‘Costs for Unreasonable behaviour’’.
6. The FCA complains that the application for costs is out of time, and asks for the opportunity to make submissions if the application is, nevertheless entertained.
7. I am prepared to extend time for the application to be made on the basis that the Appellant says it is based on ‘new’ material. I am aware that the FCA opposes the application, but I do not think it is necessary to consider further submissions from the FCA to deal with this application, or from the Commissioner.
The Law
8. Proceedings before the First-tier Tribunal do not generally involve costs orders against the parties.  However, there is a provision in rule 10 (1)(b) of the Tribunal’s Rules, giving the Tribunal power to award costs against a party who acts unreasonably in bringing, defending or conducting the proceedings.
9. Rule 10 of The Tribunal Procedure (First-tier Tribunal) (General Regulatory Chamber) Rules 2009 relies on the statutory authority of s.29 of the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007.  It provides, materially, as follows:
Orders for costs
10.—(1) … the Tribunal may make an order in respect of costs…only—
(a) Under section 29(4)of the 2007 Act (wasted costs) and costs incurred in applying for such costs;
(b) if the Tribunal considers that a party has acted unreasonably in bringing, defending or conducting the proceedings;..
(c) …
…
(2) The Tribunal may make an order under paragraph (1) on an application or on its own initiative.
10. There is some case law which sets out the approach to be taken by the Tribunal. Thus, the Decision of the Upper Tribunal (Lands Chamber) in Willow Court Management Co (1985) Ltd v Alexander [2016] UKUT 290 (LC) applied the Court of Appeal’s judgment in Ridehalgh v Horsefield [1994] Ch 205. I note in particular the test set out at paragraph 28 of the Upper Tribunal’s Decision in Willow Court, described as follows:-
At the first stage, the question is whether the person has acted unreasonably.  A decision that the conduct of a party has been unreasonable does not involve an exercise of discretion but rather the application of an objective standard of conduct to the facts of the case.  If there is no reasonable explanation for the conduct complained of, the behaviour will properly be adjudged to be unreasonable, and the threshold for the making of an order will have been crossed.
11. The authorities provide a definition of “unreasonable conduct” as involving conduct which is vexatious, designed to harass the other side, and does not permit of a reasonable explanation.
12. The Upper Tribunal’s conclusion in Willow Court was that, only if the first stage test was met, should the Tribunal go on to consider stage two (whether it ought to make an order for costs in the light of the unreasonable conduct found to have occurred).  If the answer to that question is yes, then it must move to stage three (to consider in what terms the order should be made).  Stages two and three involve the exercise of judicial discretion.
Decision
As will be seen from the Tribunal’s decision this was a difficult case to decide when considering whether the Appellant’s request was vexatious.  We said:-
The Tribunal has found this a finely balanced case. We take on board all that the FCA has said about the burden that the Appellant’s frequent engagement with it over a period of years has placed upon the resources that the FCA. The requests which are the subject of this appeal are unnecessarily lengthy and convoluted as the FCA says. We are concerned about some of his tone and language when his avowed aim is simply seeking information.  There is evidence of persistence in the face of explanations provided by the FCA and limits on what information the FCA can provide.
We also said that the Tribunal’s decision to allow the appeal was made with “some hesitation…” and that it was a decision made only by “a narrow margin…”.
The first stage of the Willow Court test is to consider whether there is a reasonable explanation for the conduct complained of.  Applying an objective test, in my view it would be impossible to say that the FCA or the Commissioner acted unreasonably in defending these proceedings by maintaining the  position that the request was vexatious.
There were valid reasons for arguing that the request was vexatious (as explained in the Tribunal’s decision) largely based on the burdensomeness of the requests on the FCA and it was not unreasonable for the FCA or the Commissioner to defend the appeal, albeit unsuccessfully.
The fact that the Appellant’s underlying dispute with the FCA continues (based on new evidence or otherwise) is not something which affects this decision. Any application for costs is limited to considering a party’s conduct as part of the appeal proceedings as set out at rule 10(1)(b) of the Tribunal Rules.
As I have found that the FCA and the Commissioner did not act unreasonably in defending the proceedings, I do not need to continue to consider whether a costs order should be made or the terms of any order.   Asthe case does not come within the categories in rule 10(1)(b) of the Rules, there is no general discretion for the Tribunal to award costs on any other basis.
Postscript
The above reasoning was written on 7 August 2024. However, I am told that because of an administrative oversight the decision was not issued. That has given me the opportunity to consider further representations made by the Appellant.
Firstly, the Appellant sought to supplement his costs application in documents attached to an email dated 7 August 2025 (not seen by me before the reasons above were formulated), which made reference to actions of the FCA and the Commissioner after the decision in this case was promulgated.
Secondly, there is an email dated 17 January 2025 which attached part of a formal whistle-blower disclosure document sent to the Commissioner dated 9 January 2025, along with other documents.
It does not seem to me that any of these subsequent matters change my findings above that the FCA and the Commissioner were not unreasonable in defending this appeal (albeit unsuccessfully), on the ground that the requests were vexatious, largely based on a claim of burdensomeness of the requests.
Therefore, no order for costs is made against the FCA or the Commissioner and the application is dismissed.
I also note that the Appellant has made a claim for contempt of court against the FCA, supplemented by his emails of 7 August 2024 and 17 January 2025. It seems to me that that application should be referred to the Registrar and, if appropriate, case management directions given.

.............................
THE HONOURABLE MR JUSTICE THOMPSELL
Mr Justice Thompsell:
INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND
This judgment relates to a hearing on 16, 17 and 20 January 2025, being the Sanction Hearing in relation to a proposed restructuring plan (the “Plan”) under Part 26A of the Companies Act 2006 (“CA 2006”). The Plan relates to Sino-Ocean Group Holding Limited (the “Plan Company”). The Plan Company seeks the court’s sanction of the Plan.
The background to, and main features of, the Plan were outlined in my judgment relating to the Convening Hearing on 18 October 2024 (Neutral Citation Number: [2024] EWHC 2851 (Ch)) (the “Convening Judgment”). Terms defined in the Convening Judgment are also used in this judgment.
I will not repeat all that explanation, but as a reminder of some of the major features:
The Plan Company is incorporated in Hong Kong, and its shares are listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.
The Plan Company has defaulted on its debt and faces enforcement action by numerous groups of financial creditors. A winding-up petition (the “Petition”) was presented against the Plan Company in Hong Kong on 27 June 2024 in respect of an undisputed debt exceeding US$13 million. The Petition has been adjourned three times to allow the Plan Company to promulgate the Plan and for its subsidiary, Sino-Ocean Land (Hong Kong) Limited, to promulgate a linked Hong Kong scheme of arrangement (referred to further below). Unless there is another adjournment, the Petition is due to be heard on 17 February 2025.
The Plan constitutes one part of an overall cross-jurisdictional arrangement (the “Reorganisation”). The Plan Liabilities under the scope of the Plan are governed by Hong Kong law (in the case of Class A) and English law (in the case of Classes B, C and D).
To ensure that the compromise of the Class A Debt is regarded as fully effective in Hong Kong, as well as in the United Kingdom, Sino-Ocean Land (Hong Kong) Limited has also proposed a parallel scheme of arrangement in Hong Kong (the “Hong Kong Scheme”). The Hong Kong Scheme relates only to the debt governed by Hong Kong law which is the same debt that forms the Class A Debt. The Plan and the Hong Kong Scheme are inter-conditional.
It is intended that the Plan will achieve its objective by restructuring the four key classes of the Group’s unsecured financial indebtedness (labelled “Class A” to “Class D”) and providing for the release of those liabilities in return for the issue of a package of new secured debt instruments convertible securities and perpetual Securities termed the “Plan Consideration”.
The Plan Consideration falls into two basic categories:
New debt claims in the form of either a new loan obligation (relevant to the proposed Class A creditors), or new notes. The new notes are relevant for the other proposed classes of creditor, and are an option offered to the proposed Class A creditors as an alternative to the proposed new loan obligations. It is understood that the commercial terms of the new loan obligations and of the new notes are broadly equivalent, so that the difference between them is principally one of form.
New securities in the form of either new mandatory convertible bonds (“MCBs”) (which convert, subject to the terms of the MCB’s, on (i) a voluntary basis or (ii) on a mandatory basis into shares in the Plan Company 24 months after issuance or upon an event of default) or new perpetual securities which appear to be the equivalent of a type of preference share, though ranking as debt rather than share capital.
The Plan proposes the issuance of these different types of Plan Consideration in different proportions in respect of different classes, and in some cases, with some elections being available to members of particular classes between these different types of security. For this purpose the Plan Company has categorised the Plan Creditors into the four classes, Classes A to D, reflecting among other things, the different rights that the Plan Company proposes to offer for these different classes of creditor, if the Plan succeeds. This in turn has been influenced by the Plan Company’s assessment of what each of these classes of creditor would be likely to receive in the event of the Company entering into formal liquidation proceedings which, the Plan Company considers, will trigger severe distress worldwide across the Group, including a combination of enforcements, insolvency filings and distressed sales. The Plan Company argues that this is the “relevant alternative” against which the Plan should be judged. Whilst each class (other than Class D, which is subordinated to the other classes) ranks pari passu as regards the obligations of the Plan Company, it is forecast that each class would receive substantially different returns in the relevant alternative. This is because the different classes have in addition recourse to other co-obligors within the Plan Company’s group which would have available different assets to satisfy (in part) the obligations to creditors in the different classes.
The Convening Hearing took place before me on 18 October 2024. I made an order (the “Convening Order”) giving the Plan Company liberty to convene meetings of the Plan Creditors of the four classes (the “Plan Meetings”) to consider and, if thought fit, approve the Plan.
In accordance with the Convening Order, the Plan Meetings took place on 22 November 2024. According to the Chairperson’s Report, the results of the Plan Meetings are as follows:
A total of 938 Plan Creditors voted at the Plan Meetings. This figure excludes multi-class positions where Plan Creditors hold positions across more than one class and does not double count Plan Creditors with multiple positions in a single class.
The Plan was approved by over 75% in value of those voting at the meetings of the Class A creditors and the Class C creditors. However, the Plan was not approved by the requisite statutory majorities of the Class B creditors and the Class D creditors.
In more detail, the voting outcomes were as follows:
in Class A, the Plan was supported by 100% in value of those voting (with a turnout of 86.2% in value);
in Class B, the Plan was supported by 47.7% in value of those voting, (with a turnout of 73.9% in value): of those voting: a majority voted against;
in Class C, the Plan was supported by 81.5% in value of those voting (with a turnout of 84.5% in value); and
in Class D, the Plan was supported by 34.9% in value of those voting (with a turnout of 61.9% in value), of those voting, a majority voted against.
In total, the Plan was approved by over 74% in value of those voting across all four classes.
Although a number of Plan Creditors within Classes B and D voted against the Plan, only one of them, Long Corridor Asset Management Limited (“Long Corridor”) has appeared at the Sanction Hearing to oppose the Plan.
Long Corridor holds a very small proportion of the Plan Liabilities:
within Class A, Long Corridor does not hold any debt;
within Class B, Long Corridor holds about US$53.7 million of the debt (representing about 3% by value);
within Class C, Long Corridor holds about US$8.8 million of the debt (representing less than 1% by value); and
within Class D, Long Corridor holds about US$22.8 million of the debt (representing about 4% by value).
In total, the Plan Liabilities held by Long Corridor (of about US$85.3 million) represent about 1.5% in value of the Plan Liabilities.
Long Corridor considers that its views are shared by other dissenting creditors especially those within what has been described as an “Ad Hoc Group” of creditors and in particular the Steering Committee of that group, although the court was not taken to any evidence to substantiate this.
Long Corridor’s chief commercial objection to the Plan is that it is too generous to shareholders. Under the Plan, whilst shareholders do face substantial dilution, they are still left with some 53.8% of the equity in the Plan Company, and this equity should have a substantial value after the reduction in the indebtedness of the Plan Company effected by the Plan. For example, one of the largest shareholders, China Life Insurance Company Limited (“China Life”), following implementation of the Plan, will retain 15.91% of the Plan Company’s equity, which the Plan Company estimates will be worth between US$7.3m and US$9.1m. The shareholders obtain this advantage without putting in any new money and against the background that they would receive nothing in the event of a liquidation.
Long Corridor considers that the result of the Plan is that shareholders will, in effect, benefit at the expense of Plan Creditors and that a fairer plan, and one that would provide greater benefit for Plan Creditors, would be one that provides them with instruments which will give them a greater share of the equity, thereby diluting existing shareholders to a small percentage.
THE ORDER SOUGHT
The Plan Company now seeks an order sanctioning the Plan under section 901F of CA 2006.
Section 901F of CA 2006 provides as follows:
If a number representing 75% in value of the creditors or class of creditors or members or class of members (as the case may be), present and voting either in person or by proxy at the meeting summoned under section 901C, agree a compromise or arrangement, the court may, on an application under this section, sanction the compromise or arrangement.
Subsection (1) is subject to … section 901G …”
The Plan Company acknowledges that this is possible only if the court exercises its power under section 901G CA 2006.
Section 901G of CA 2006 specifically empowers the Court to sanction a Plan notwithstanding the dissent of one or more classes, provided that certain conditions are satisfied. Use of this power is referred to as a “cross-class cram down”.
THE CONDITIONS FOR A CROSS-CLASS CRAM DOWN
Section 901G bears the heading “Sanction for compromise or arrangement where one or more classes dissent”. So far as is material, section 901G provides as follows:
This section applies if the compromise or arrangement is not agreed by a number representing at least 75% in value of a class of creditors or (as the case may be) of members of the company (“the dissenting class”), present and voting either in person or by proxy at the meeting summoned under section 901C.
If conditions A and B are met, the fact that the dissenting class has not agreed the compromise or arrangement does not prevent the court from sanctioning it under section 901F.
Condition A is that the court is satisfied that, if the compromise or arrangement were to be sanctioned under section 901F, none of the members of the dissenting class would be any worse off than they would be in the event of the relevant alternative (see subsection (4)).
For the purposes of this section “the relevant alternative” is whatever the court considers would be most likely to occur in relation to the company if the compromise or arrangement were not sanctioned under section 901F.
Condition B is that the compromise or arrangement has been agreed by a number representing 75% in value of a class of creditors or (as the case may be) of members, present and voting either in person or by proxy at the meeting summoned under section 901C, who would receive a payment, or have a genuine economic interest in the company, in the event of the relevant alternative.”
If I am to approve the Plan, I need to satisfy myself that the conditions in section 901G are met.  Satisfaction of those conditions is a necessary but not a sufficient reason for me to approve the Plan – I will still need to exercise the discretion provided to the judge under section 901F.
The Plan Company argues that these conditions are all met, but this view is disputed by Long Corridor. I have considered carefully the points raised by Long Corridor.
Condition A
As noted above, Condition A to the use of the cross-class cram down is that the court is satisfied that, if the compromise or arrangement were to be sanctioned under section 901F, none of the members of the dissenting class would be any worse off than they would be in the event of the relevant alternative. For these purposes the “relevant alternative” is defined as “whatever the court considers would be most likely to occur in relation to the company if the compromise or arrangement were not sanctioned under section 901F”.
The Plan Company argues that the relevant alternative is an insolvent liquidation of the Plan Company. This view is supported by the witness evidence of Mr Sum and by Ms Lisa Rickelton’s expert evidence. Mr Sum is, in relation to the Plan Company, its company secretary as well as a former chief financial officer.
Long Corridor argues that the “relevant alternative” is that some other plan would emerge that would provide a better deal for Plan Creditors by giving them more equity, thereby diluting to a small percentage the equity held by existing shareholders. It argues that “where there’s a will there’s a way” – in other words, that if the Plan is not sanctioned it would be possible to negotiate and bring into effect what they would see as a fairer deal for creditors.
In relation to the question of the relevant alternative, I must agree with the Plan Company for various reasons:
In my view the definition requires a particular alternative to be identified. Long Corridor has identified no such alternative – whilst it did at a late stage put forward a plan referred to as the “Alternative Plan”, it is not now suggesting that this is the relative alternative, and given commercial defects identified in the Alternative Plan, I think Long Corridor is being realistic in not continuing to suggest that the Alternative Plan should be regarded as the relevant alternative. Instead, Long Corridor is now promoting a vague idea that Plan Creditors and shareholders might agree another plan, but that is not sufficiently choate an idea to amount to a relative alternative. Unless a putative alternative plan is specified in detail it is impossible for the court to judge the effect on creditors of that plan.
The undisputed evidence of Mr Sum is that the Plan Company can stave off its creditors for only another month, whereas agreeing and implementing another plan would take many weeks longer. A relevant alternative must be something where there is at least some prospect of implementing the alternative, and on the evidence before the court there is no prospect that the Plan Company could hang on to do anything other than to go into liquidation.
There is evidence that the Class A creditors would not support an alternative plan of the type advocated by Long Corridor and also there may be little reason for shareholders to provide the necessary votes for it.
Long Corridor’s suggestion that a better plan could emerge out of a liquidation is not realistic given the complex nature of the Plan Company’s Group; liquidation of the Plan Company is likely to lead to severe reputational and financial damage (for example through acceleration of loans and the drying up of credit lines through-out the Group) and there would be insufficient resources to pay a liquidator to put in place and meet the necessary professional fees in developing and implementing such a plan.
For all the above reasons I conclude that the relevant alternative is an insolvent liquidation of the Plan Company. It is overwhelmingly the most likely outcome if the Plan is not approved.
Having accepted that liquidation is the relevant alternative, I accept also that each class of Plan Creditor would be substantially better off under the Plan than in the relevant alternative. This is demonstrated by the expert evidence of two senior managing directors at FTI Consulting, namely Ms Lisa Rickelton who is an experienced insolvency practitioner, and Mr Ben Johnson, an experienced valuation specialist. There has been no challenge to the expert evidence on this point.
I consider therefore that Condition A is met.
Condition B
Condition B is that the compromise or arrangement has been agreed by a number representing 75% in value of a class of creditors or (as the case may be) of members, present and voting either in person or by proxy at the meeting summoned under section 901C, who would receive a payment, or have a genuine economic interest in the company, in the event of the relevant alternative.
The Plan Company argues that Condition B is satisfied twice over since more than 75% of those voting in both Class A and Class C have voted in favour.
Long Corridor argues, for different reasons, that the votes of neither of these Classes can be used as what is referred to as a “cramming class” to satisfy Condition B.
Long Corridor points out that section 901G confers a formidable power on the court. It enables the assenting votes of one class of creditor to form the basis of imposing a restructuring plan which they approve on a dissenting class which has not approved the plan. The jurisdiction is especially susceptible to manipulation and abuse, particularly through the artificial creation of a “cramming class” of creditors.  The courts are astute to consider this point.
In Deep Ocean 1 UK Ltd [2021] EWHC 138, Trower J recognised (at [41]) that
“there may be some cross-class cram down cases in which there is artificiality in the creation of classes to ensure that the requirements of the section 901G Condition B are satisfied…”
and clearly considered that the creation of such a class would be inappropriate.
In Gategroup Guarantee [2022] 1 BCLC 98, Zacaroli J (as he then was) held (at [171]) that
“in the context of a plan under Part 26A, the artificiality of the structure is undoubtedly an issue of direct relevance to the discretion to sanction the plan”.
In Re Houst [2022] B.C.C. 1143 (“Houst”), Zacaroli J said (at [20])
“Clearly, attempts artificially to create an in-the-money class for the purposes of providing an anchor to activate the cross-class cram down power should be resisted, particularly where such a claim is not impaired by the plan”.
Long Corridor argues it is therefore particularly important for the protection of the integrity of the Part 26A regime for the inclusion of a cramming class of creditors to be properly justified. It argues further that requirement is even more acute when what is being undertaken is a “cram across” of a pari passu class of in-the-money creditors, as opposed to a cram down of a junior ranking class.
I accept these points and have taken them into account in my analysis below.
Condition B in relation to Class A
In relation to the Class A Debt, Long Corridor makes the following point:
“The Class A debt, which is governed by Hong Kong law, is being compromised pursuant to the Hong Kong scheme. That compromise will be recognised in this jurisdiction in accordance with the ordinary principles of private international law. In those circumstances, Long Corridor will contend that the inclusion of the Class A creditors in the RP is unnecessary, unjustified and its sole purpose is to create an artificial “cramming class” of creditors such that it would not be fair or appropriate in the circumstances for the Court to exercise its “cross-class cram down” powers under s.901G of the Act based on votes in favour of the RP by the Class A creditors.”
In this regard Long Corridor makes the following points:
Whilst a company is, in principle, able to select which of its creditors to include and which to exclude from a scheme of arrangement or restructuring plan, “the exclusion or inclusion of creditors from a restructuring plan” is not “a simple or unqualified choice for the company” as was said by Miles J at [126] in UK Commercial Finance Holding Ltd v Cine UK Ltd [2024] EWHC 2475 (Ch). Instead, as Snowden J put it in Re Co-operative Bank Plc [2017] EWHC 2269 (Ch) at [38]:
“it ought to have a rational commercial justification other than simply a desire to arrange matters so as to achieve the required statutory majorities of those who are included”.
The Class A Debt is governed by Hong Kong law. As a consequence, Long Corridor argues, it cannot be effectively compromised under the Plan - Hong Kong is a jurisdiction which applies the rule in Anthony Gibbs & Sons v La Societe Industrielle et Commerciale des Metaux (1890) 25 QBD 399 (“Gibbs”), that is that the question of whether an obligation has been discharged is governed by its proper law so that a compromise of Hong Kong law debt under English law will not be given effect outside of the jurisdiction – except to the extent that creditors have submitted to the jurisdiction of the English court.
As a result of the rule in Gibbs a compromise of the Class A Debt pursuant to the Hong Kong Scheme will be effective both in Hong Kong and elsewhere (including in the United Kingdom). These features of the Class A Debt mean that its inclusion in the Plan as a separate class is unnecessary. There is no need for Class A to be included in the Plan given the Class A Debt is being compromised through the Hong Kong Scheme.
It is also (Long Corridor alleges) entirely unprecedented that the compromise of a debt with such features would be used as a cramming class in a Plan. Long Corridor alleges that the Plan Company (with the support of the committee of creditors supporting the Plan (“CoCom”) has included the Class A Debt purely to ensure that there is a cramming class.
To rely on that class as the basis to cram down dissenting creditors would be wholly unprecedented, manifestly unfair, and contrary to principle, irrespective of the general merits, or otherwise, of the Plan.
I agree with the Plan Company that this objection is misconceived.
The matter needs to be considered first in relation to the plain words of Part 26A. The Class A creditors are “creditors” who are parties to the “arrangement” with the Plan Company constituted by the Plan and, I consider, whose rights are affected by the Plan. As such, they are entitled to be convened to a meeting to consider and, if thought fit, approve the Plan. Moreover, the Class A creditors constitute an assenting class for the purpose of section 901G(5) since they would receive a payment, or have a genuine economic interest, in the Plan Company in the event of the relevant alternative.
Long Corridor argues that the Class A creditors are not affected by the Plan as it is the Hong Kong Scheme, not the Plan that has the effect of binding them as a class: a decision by the English court cannot affect the Class A creditors and it is unprecedented and unjustified to allow a class that is not itself (as a class) bound by the Plan  to cram down other classes.
A good part of the reason why Long Corridor says that this is objectionable is the idea that there is a lack of reciprocity if the Class A creditors can use their votes to cram down other classes but are not susceptible themselves of being crammed down since they cannot be bound by the English law proceedings. I do not consider this correctly summarises the position.
The Gibbs rule is not absolute. As per (Re OJSC International Bank of Azerbaijan [2019] Bus LR 1130 at [28]) (which, according to expert evidence would be followed in Hong Kong):
“[T]here is an exception to the [Gibbs] rule if the relevant creditor submits to the foreign insolvency proceeding. In that situation, the creditor is taken to have accepted that his contractual rights will be governed by the law of the foreign insolvency proceeding”.
For these purposes, voting on the Plan (whether for or against) would constitute submission. The overwhelming majority of the members of Class A have agreed under the terms of the RSA to support both the Plan and the Hong Kong Scheme, and in voting to support the Plan have submitted to the jurisdiction of the English courts. Having so voted they are bound by English law and in a way that would be recognised by Hong Kong law by the Plan. It is not true then that the Plan has no effect on those who have voted – they are bound by English law, and this means that the Plan has a substantial effect on the Class A creditors.
Furthermore, the fact that these creditors are bound by the RSA to vote in favour of it also means that it is inevitable that the Hong Kong Scheme will take effect.
The position, therefore, is really no different to the position where a class of creditors is constituted where the members of the class have already committed themselves to vote in favour of a restructuring plan. As can be seen from a number of cases there is no objection to such a class of creditors being constituted. The argument that creditors who have already committed themselves to a restructuring plan are not affected by the plan is not one that has found any favour with the court.
A key authority on this point is Houst [2022] BCC 1143. In that case, Zacaroli J sanctioned a plan which crammed down HMRC in reliance on an assenting class consisting of a single secured creditor (the Bank). The Bank ultimately consented to the plan, which meant that it did not need to be a plan creditor at all (save for the purposes of acting as an assenting class and thereby facilitating a cross-class cram down). One of the issues before the Court was whether the inclusion of the Bank as an assenting class was artificial or abusive. Zacaroli J answered this question in the negative. At [19]-[21], Zacaroli J said:
“I note that in Virgin Atlantic Airways Ltd [2020] EWHC 2376 (Ch), at [49]-[50], Snowden J left open the question whether the power to cram down a dissenting class under section 901G can be activated by including within a plan a class of creditors who would otherwise all have been prepared to enter into consensual arrangements to give effect to the restructuring of their rights. I sought submissions from Counsel on this point following the hearing, and I am grateful to Mr Haywood for his speedy response to that request.
Clearly, attempts artificially to create an in-the-money class for the purposes of providing the anchor to activate the cross-class cram down power should be resisted, particularly where such a class is not impaired by the plan. Where, as here, however, the in-the-money class of creditors is undoubtedly adversely affected by the Company’s insolvency and is substantially impaired under the plan, then I do not think that the mere fact that 100% of that class is prepared to support the plan is a reason to prevent the cross-class cram-down power being exercised. I do not think there is a relevant distinction between a case where all but a small minority of the class are in favour, and one where the merits of the plan have persuaded the whole of the class to support the plan. Nor do I think it makes a difference, as a matter of jurisdiction to exercise the cross-class cram-down power, that there is only one creditor within the class.
As Zacaroli J explained at [20], there is nothing inherently abusive in the inclusion of an assenting class within a plan, even where this has the effect of facilitating a cross-class cram down. Rather, the Court will consider whether the assenting class is “adversely affected by the Company’s insolvency” and is “substantially impaired under the plan”. Put simply, the Court will ask whether the plan has a meaningful impact on the assenting class. If the plan has a meaningful impact on the assenting class, then the inclusion of the assenting class cannot be described as abusive (or artificial or unjustified).
Houst was very recently followed by Edwin Johnson J and Miles J in Re Cine-UK Ltd. This was a case where a restructuring plan was unanimously approved at meetings of a single intercompany lender and meetings of the term loan lenders (who had committed to support the plans in advance by signing a restructuring support agreement). In the unreported convening judgment, Edwin Johnson J cited and approved the decision of Zacaroli J in Re Houst and held that there was no objectionable artificiality. In the sanction judgment (reported as [2024] Bus LR 1944), Miles J likewise approved the decision of Zacaroli J in Houst and held that there was no objectionable artificiality.
Further, there have been a number of other cases where creditors (particularly secured creditors) have been included in plans and treated as assenting classes (alongside other assenting classes), even though the relevant classes unanimously supported the plan.
In practice, where a cross-class cram down is required, a deal is frequently reached with all or a very substantial majority of the members of the assenting class, and that class is included in the plan for the purpose of enabling a cross-class cram down to be sanctioned by the Court. If a cross-class cram down were unnecessary, then the inclusion of the assenting class in the plan would often be unnecessary: the assenting class could instead be compromised outside of the plan (e.g. on a consensual basis, whether on a bilateral basis or by using a majority consent procedure in the finance documents). This does not mean that the inclusion of the assenting class in the plan is artificial or unjustified. If the position were otherwise, then Part 26A would be deprived of its intended purpose.
In my view, there is nothing artificial, and no whiff of impermissible forum-shopping in the constitution of the Class A creditors as a class of creditor in the Plan. For the purposes of this analysis, it is appropriate to look at the entirety of the Reorganisation including the Plan and the Hong Kong Scheme, and taken as a whole the arrangements are ones that affect all classes, including Class A. Certainly the over 80% of Class A that voted in favour are clearly affected by the Plan.
If Long Corridor’s contention on this point were to be accepted, this would militate against the will of Parliament in adopting Part 26A CA 2006, in that it would deny companies that were operating internationally the ability to deal holistically with the different classes of their creditors in accordance with Part 26A if they had classes of debt in a jurisdiction like Hong Kong where some separate scheme was needed to ensure that all those debtors were to be included. In fact, the use of foreign schemes or plans to assist with the effectiveness of an English scheme or plan is commonplace. This was the case with Re Drax Holdings Ltd [2004] 1 WLR 1049 where parallel schemes were proposed in England, Jersey and the Cayman Islands to compromise a range of financial liabilities, some of which were not governed by English law. This was also the position in Re Hong Kong Airlines Ltd [2023] BCC 477, where an English plan was proposed in parallel with a Hong Kong scheme of arrangement. The English plan compromised three classes of debt (governed by a combination of English, and Hong Kong law and that of the People’s Republic of China (“PRC”)), whereas the parallel scheme in Hong Kong compromised only the Hong Kong and PRC law debt. Sir Alastair Norris explained (at [9] that:
“… the plan cannot of itself achieve a compromise in relation to any liability governed by Hong Kong law, because Hong Kong is a jurisdiction which applies The Rule in Gibbs (Anthony Gibbs & Sons v La Societe Industrielle et Commerciale des Metaux (1890) 25 Q.B.D. 399). There is therefore a parallel scheme of arrangement under the Hong Kong Companies (Winding Up and Miscellaneous Provisions) Ordinance in the same terms (save that it does not deal with the English law debt, principally the PNs) as the proposed plan.”
I therefore agree with the Plan Company’s contention that the fact that the Hong Kong Scheme is being used in order to ensure that the Plan and restructuring are effective in relation to the small remainder of the Class A creditors who have note voted in relation to the Plan, is not any reason for disregarding or discounting the Class A creditors as a cramming class.
As to the proposition that this finding is unprecedented, that contention depends on a very narrow construction of the circumstances here. As I have mentioned there have been other cases where debt that is governed by the law of another jurisdiction, including in the case of Re Hong Kong Airlines, one that adopts Gibbs and one that makes use of an overseas scheme of arrangement. The only feature here which I think can be said to be unprecedented, is the point that the Class A Debt ranks pari passu with the debt in the other classes (other than Class D) and neither side has shown me a case where a class comprised of overseas debt, and subject to an overseas scheme, and ranking pari passu, has been used as a cramming class.
It is unsurprising that there would be no such precedent, since the usual position would be that debt ranking pari passu would be offered the same consideration in the restructuring plan and would form a single class. In this case, there were good reasons why a differentiation was made between the Plan Consideration offered to the different classes, based on trying to give them a similar multiple of the returns that they would obtain in the relative alternative and, as I found at the Convening Hearing, this has led to a necessity for the Plan to recognise a multiplicity of classes. This is unusual, but I do not think this unusual feature provides any reason not to recognise Class A as being a bona fide cramming class. If this means that I am making a decision without the benefit of a precedent, then I can only say that there must always be a first time.
Condition B in relation to Class C
Long Corridor also objects to the Plan Company’s reliance on the results of the Class C meeting as creating a cramming class for the purposes of Condition B. It argues, that the necessary 75% majority was achieved only by the inclusion of the votes of a creditor, China Life Franklin Asset Management Co. Limited (“China Life Franklin”) an affiliate of one of the shareholders. China Life. China Life stands to benefit substantially (and Long Corridor would say, unfairly) from the terms of the Plan which will, as we have seen, allow shareholders to retain substantial equity, despite the fact that their claims are inferior to those of the different classes of creditor, and they would get nothing in the relevant alternative.
The results of the Class C meeting were as follows:
Turnout by value: 42.5% (excluding China Life Franklin), 84.5% (including China Franklin).
The percentage voting for (by value) was 63.1% (excluding China Life Franklin), 81.5% (including China Life Franklin).
The Class C meeting therefore approved the Plan by the necessary minimum percentage of 75% only by reason of the affirmative votes cast in respect of existing debt instruments held on behalf of China Life Franklin.
Long Corridor argues that the votes of China Life’s affiliates in favour of the Plan was most likely motivated by an extraneous interest (namely, the promotion of China Life’s interests as shareholder) and that this was an interest adverse to the interests of the class. In those circumstances, the votes obtained in the Class C meeting cannot be relied on as creating a “cramming class” under section 901G(5).
Where the court is invited to sanction a plan under Part 26A that involves a “cross class cram down” it must first consider the position of the putative assenting classes before turning to consider whether it is appropriate, in all the circumstances, to exercise its discretion to impose the plan on the dissenting classes (see Re AGPS Bondco [2024] EWCA Civ 24, [2024] Bus LR 745 (“AGPS Bondco”) at [118]-[120] and [128]).
In relation to an assenting class, the court will apply the principles that are applied where a court is asked to exercise its discretion to sanction a scheme of arrangement under Part 26 CA 2006. They are summarised in what David Richards J described, in Re Telewest Communications (No 2) [2004] EWHC 1466 at [20], as the “classic formulation” of applicable principles in the judgment of Plowman J in Re National Bank Limited [1966] 1 WLR at page 819. This involves (in addition to the court being satisfied that the statutory requirements have been met) that:
“the class was fairly represented by those who attended the meeting and that the statutory majority are acting bona fide and are not coercing the minority in order to promote interests adverse to those of the class whom they purport to represent, and thirdly, that the arrangement is such as an intelligent and honest man, a member of the class concerned and acting in respect of his interest, might reasonably approve.
The court does not sit merely to see that the majority are acting bona fide and thereupon to register the decision of the meeting; but at the same time the court will be slow to differ from the meeting, unless either the class has not been properly consulted, or the meeting has not considered the matter with a view to the interests of the class which it is empowered to bind, or some blot is found in the scheme”.
The requirement that members of the majority have voted in the interests of the class as a whole is critical for safeguarding the integrity and fairness of the statutory regime. One of the key functions of the court in considering whether to sanction a scheme is to:
“see that the minority is not being overridden by a majority having interests of its own clashing with those of the minority whom they seek to coerce”: Re Alabama, New Orleans, Texas and Pacific Junction Railway Co [1891] 1 Ch 213 per Lindley LJ at p.239.
In Re Lehman Brothers International (Europe) [2019] Bus LR 1012, (“Lehman Brothers”) Hildyard J summarised the issues at play where there is a challenge to the representative nature of a vote.
First, (as mentioned at [89]) there must be a special interest held by a sub-group of creditors within a class,
“which is adverse to, or clashes with, the interests of the class as a whole” at [89].
A special interest which simply provides an additional reason for supporting the scheme (without clashing or conflicting with the interests of the class as a whole) will not undermine the representative nature of a vote.
Second, that special interest must be the “predominant cause” for that sub-group voting in favour of the arrangement see at [88(b)]. As mentioned at [90] and [91], this is an objective test requiring:
“a strong and direct causative link between the creditor’s decision to support the scheme and the creditor’s adverse interest such that it is the adverse interest which drives the creditor’s voting decision”.
In applying that approach, however, the court should not be circumscribed by inflexible rules (e.g. by the application of a rigid “but for test”). The ultimate question is whether the special interest creditor has voted with a view to the interests of the class or not.
Third, the vote of the sub-group must be material in obtaining the requisite majority at the class meeting.
If the court is satisfied that the statutory majority has been obtained by reason of votes cast otherwise than in the interests of the class as a whole, the court has a discretion either to discount the weight given to the majority vote and consider the fairness of the scheme without adopting any particular presumption in favour of the majority or altogether disregard the relevant votes of “special interest” creditors so that the relevant votes are void, and do not count at all towards the statutory majority, in which case if the requisite majorities are not achieved, the scheme must fail (see Lehman Brothers at [109]).
Long Corridor argues that the votes of China Life’s affiliates should be disregarded as China Life Franklin clearly has a “special interest” by reason of its status as an affiliate of the shareholder. That special interest is “adverse” to or (at the very least) “clashes with” the interests of the Class C creditors as a whole. This is because a central consideration for Class C creditors at the Plan Meeting was whether the proposed distribution of the benefits of the restructuring is fair and, in particular, whether the retention of at least 53.8% of the Plan Company’s equity by existing shareholders is properly justified. China Life is the Plan Company’s largest shareholder and, following implementation of the Plan, will retain 15.91% of the Plan Company’s equity, which, as we have seen, the Plan Company estimates will be worth between US$7.3m and US$9.1m.  Long Corridor argues that it is obvious that the interests of China Life Franklin in its affiliate retaining equity in the restructured Group (and in minimising its dilution) is in conflict with the interests of Class C creditors in maximising their returns as creditors and that the court should also conclude that the special interest was the “predominant cause” for this affiliate of China Life to vote in favour of the Plan.
At the commencement of the hearing, the Plan Company had not adduced any evidence to explain China Life Franklin’s reasons for voting in favour of the Plan. However, before the hearing ended, some evidence was produced in the form of a further witness statement from Mr Sum and a letter from China Life Franklin explaining their process for dealing with the matter.
Whilst it would be much better to have had a witness statement from the investment manager concerned (and to have had this much earlier in the process), the evidence adduced is, I consider, something that the court can take into account. In effect, that evidence was that China Life Franklin is a regulated investment manager and constitutes a joint venture between China Life, China Life Overseas Company Limited (“China Life Overseas”) (a sister company to China Life) and an otherwise unconnected party, Franklin Templeton Strategic Investments Ltd. China Life Franklin had a discretionary asset management mandate in relation to the relevant Class C notes (which it held on behalf of China Life Overseas). It had exercised its discretion in voting on the Plan in accordance with what it considered to be the best interests of its client, specifically as the Plan was far better for its client than the alternative of an insolvent liquidation. It made this decision in accordance with a strict conflict-of-interest policy which would not allow it to take into account its own interest as an affiliate of China Life.
This evidence, I consider, casts very substantial doubt on the presumption argued for by Long Corridor that it was voting in the interests of its affiliate China Life. It directly contradicts the contention that (to use the words used in Lehman Brothers) there was a strong and direct causative link between the creditor’s decision to support the Plan and the creditor’s adverse interest such that it is the adverse interest which drives the creditor’s voting decision.
There is therefore a very strong argument that this evidence concludes the question as to whether these votes were influenced by a consideration that was adverse to the interests of the class.
However, I will also consider the possibility that this evidence does not conclude the matter. To the extent that there remains any suggestion that this vote was influenced by a desire to benefit China Life, I need to consider whether that desire is likely to have been a predominant reason for voting in favour of the Plan, or whether this was merely an additional reason.
I think there are three good arguments why, if the decision (contrary to what evidence we have) was influenced by any motivation to assist China Life, that motivation should be regarded as an additional reason rather than the predominant reason.
The first such reason is that to make a decision having primary regard to this point would be a breach of the standards expected by a regulated investment firm, and I see no reason to doubt that the firm would have had a conflict-of-interest policy which would prevent this.
The second reason is that, even excluding the votes of China Life Franklin, a majority (some 63.1%) of the other Class C creditors who voted, voted in favour, so clearly the Plan as it related to this Class was one that someone without the putative competing interest could approve.
As to this second reason, Long Corridor argues that this support is, in any event, an unreliable indicator of creditors’ assessment of the merits. This is on two bases. The first is that the Explanatory Statement was flawed in failing to contain a clear or sufficient explanation of the benefits accruing to existing shareholders under the Plan. The second is that certain key documents, including documents that confirmed (it seems, although this is the subject of argument, on a non-binding basis) the financial and operational support that China Life intended to provide the Plan Company were not made available to Plan Creditors until after votes had been cast.
I do not accept these points.
It is true that the value of the interest that China Life (and the other existing shareholders) would have as a result of implementation of the Plan was not given the prominence in the Explanatory Statement that I had suggested in the Convening Judgment that it should be given. I understand that this is because the Convening Judgment was received after the Explanatory Statement had been sent out. Nevertheless, it was clear in the Explanatory Statement that it would be retaining a substantial shareholding (and would receive nothing in the relevant alternative), and it was clear from other financial documents that were made available to the Plan Creditors what the valuation of this holding would be. Given the sophistication of the Plan Creditors, it seems very likely that they would have understood this point.
As regards the documents relating to support from China Life, having those documents could only be an additional reason for Plan Creditors to favour China Life continuing to hold a specific shareholding, not a reason to discount the value of China Life’s involvement. The absence of this information therefore is unlikely to have influenced a vote in favour.
The third reason is that there were at least two rational bases on which a member of Class C could make a decision to approve the Plan, even if it considered that the Plan unduly rewarded shareholders:
first, as has been argued by the Plan Company and illustrated by the financial projections made in reports by FTI Consulting, and as I discuss further below, because allowing shareholders to retain shares such that there were two shareholders owned by the  PRC state each with at least a 15% interest would benefit the Plan Company as it would reduce the perceived risks in the Plan Company, which should be reflected in a lower discount rate affecting the value of the securities that they would hold under the Plan; and
secondly, even if the Plan was unfair, it was better than the alternative of a liquidation.
Having regard to all the above points, there is no reason why the court should discount or disregard the votes of China Life Franklin. It seems far more likely that the decision was made entirely with a view to providing the maximum return for its client, rather than favouring its affiliate. Even if this was not the case, I consider that the benefit to an affiliate would have been at most an additional reason rather than a predominant reason.
Conclusion in relation to Condition B
As I consider that there is no reason not to accept either Class A or Class C as cramming classes, I consider that Condition B is met.
THE OBJECTION THAT SHAREHOLDERS WERE NOT INCLUDED AS A CLASS
Long Corridor pursued one more technical objection to the effectiveness of the Plan. This was that a meeting of the shareholders should have been convened to vote on the Plan – and that, absent such a meeting, the court has no jurisdiction to sanction the Plan.
The argument relies on section 901C(3), which provides that “every creditor or member of the company whose rights are affected by the compromise or arrangement must be permitted to participate in a meeting ordered to be summoned under subsection (1)” (emphasis added).
It was highly unsatisfactory that this point was being raised at the Sanction Hearing. It was properly a point to be raised at the Convening Hearing.  Neither party raised the question of the need for a shareholder class to be included in the Plan at the Convening Hearing, but nevertheless I did consider the point and in the Convening Judgment dealt with it (at [33]) as follows:
“First, it may be asked why the shareholders of the Company, who are affected by these arrangements are not parties. I have already explained above why the Company does not consider this to be necessary. I note that under paragraph 2 of the Practice Statement, it is the responsibility of the applicant (in this case the Plan Company) to determine whether more than one meeting of creditors and/or members is required by a scheme and if so to ensure that those meetings are properly constituted. If the Company has decided that it does not need to bind its shareholders into the Plan, I do not think it is for the court to decide that they should be so bound, unless their not being so bound poses a threat to the viability of the Plan. In this case I am content to follow the Company’s assessment that it does not.”
Long Corridor now makes the argument that the shareholders must be included, and gives as its reason for not dealing with this point earlier the point that they had not thought of it earlier.
Long Corridor’s argument runs that In Re Hurricane Energy Plc [2021] EWHC 1418 (“Re Hurricane”), Zacaroli J held (at [27]-[34]) that a plan involving a debt-for-equity swap, which resulted in shareholders’ interests being diluted, was within the meaning of a “compromise or arrangement” which “affects” shareholders’ rights in the relevant sense. He held (at [28]) that the shareholders were affected by the issue of new shares under the Plan in that case “in at least two ways”:
“First their pre-emption rights and rights relating to approval of allotments by directors (under the Articles and sections 549(1) and 561(1) CA 2006) are overridden by the Plan”.
The judge was here referring to the effect of section 566A CA 2006, which disapplies shareholders’ pre-emption rights in the context of a restructuring plan. He went on to explain a second way in which shareholders’ rights were being affected:
“Second, their shareholding will, as a result of the Plan, be diluted to 5% of its current value”.
Whilst he saw some force in an argument made on behalf of the plan company in that case that the contractual rights of the shareholders against that company are not altered by the dilution of their shareholding under the Restructuring plan, it is merely their economic value that has changed, the judge was not persuaded by this argument. He held (at [33]) that:
““Affected by” is a phrase of broad ambit. It is far broader, for example, than “amended by” or “altered by”
and (at [34]) that the better view was:
“that the rights of shareholders (who are taken to have an economic interest in the company) to participate in the capital and profits of a company are “affected by” a Plan that would dilute such participation”.
As the Plan in this case also involves a dilution of members’ shareholding interests since it provides for Plan Creditors to be issued MCBs in return for a compromise of their debt, Long Corridor considers that the rights of shareholders are affected in this case also.
In response to this point, the Plan Company draws a distinction between the position in Re Hurricane where it was the effect of the plan itself, in conjunction with the provisions of s.566A CA 2006 , to disapply the rights of shareholders under the plan company’s articles that caused shareholders to be “affected by the Plan”, whereas in the current case the Plan will not disapply any of the ordinary rights of the shareholders under the Plan Company’s articles and the Hong Kong Companies Ordinance. This, I agree, is a crucial distinction.
Long Corridor argues that this distinction does not provide a full answer in that it ignores the fact that in Re Hurricane the court held that the rights of shareholders affected by the issue of new shares under the Restructuring Plan were not only by the loss of their pre-emption rights and rights to approve allotments but also through the dilution of shareholders’ equity. Whilst the former point is not a feature of the Plan, the second is.
I am not persuaded by this argument. In the current case (unlike Re Hurricane) shareholders were required to pass (and did pass) a shareholders’ resolution at an extraordinary general meeting (“EGM”) approving the issuance of the MCBs. I agree that it is the passing of that resolution (in exercise of the shareholders’ rights and in accordance with Hong Kong law) which will cause the dilution of the equity held by the existing shareholders through the issuance of the MCBs.
Long Corridor argues that this is not entirely accurate - the EGM permitted the Plan Company to issue MCBs under the Plan, but it remains the case that they will in fact be issued under the Plan, in return for a compromise of Plan Creditors’ claims. The shareholder vote has made shareholder dilution possible but it is the compromise of creditors’ rights under the Plan which will effect that dilution.
Long Corridor has put the question succinctly in its skeleton argument. The essential question is whether:
shareholders’ rights “are affected” by the Plan, which involves issuing instruments to creditors in a manner which will significantly dilute shareholders’ interests: in which case, the requirements of Part 26A have not been met; or
shareholders’ rights are not so affected, by reason of the fact that they have approved the issuance of those instruments at an EGM.
In my view the answer is clearly (ii), having regard to both the wording of the Plan and considering the matter as one of principle.
As regards the wording of the Plan, the chief effective provision of the Plan is included in clause 7.1. This has the effect of releasing the existing claims of Plan Creditors “subject to the conditions set out herein”. These conditions include receipt of the Plan Consideration including the new MCBs. The point is backed up by Clause 12 under which the Plan Creditors give releases and provide a further assurance, backed up by a power of attorney in favour of the Plan Company, in relation to anything that is necessary or desirable to affect the release of any released claims. The Plan Company is therefore able to argue that the Plan does not actually of itself bring about the issue of the MCBs (any more than the shareholders’ resolution brings about the issue of the MCBs), it creates a structure whereby the Plan Company through a separate act, acting on the authority already given by shareholders, issues the MCBs in order to satisfy a condition precedent to the release of existing claims.
I see some force in this textual argument, but there is an objection that I suspect that the same point likely could have been made in Re Hurricane Energy as the drafting of plans tends to follow a similar form.
A further argument that could be made is that the MCBs (unlike the direct issue of shares contemplated in Re Hurricane Energy) do not directly dilute the rights of shareholders – that dilution comes only where the MCBs are converted into shares. There is no doubt an immediate effect on the trading value of shares but not, as there was in Re Hurricane Energy, a direct and immediate change in the quantum of the existing shareholders rights, for example, to vote.
The point is that it is a combination of various different acts that gives rise to the dilution that shareholders will face. A diluting share issue has or will require in this case: (i) the issuance of the MCBs being approved by the shareholders (which has already happened); (ii) the Plan being sanctioned; (iii) the directors of the Plan Company issuing the MCBs and executing the relevant instruments; and (iv) the Plan Company or the holders of the MCBs converting them to shares. Any of these steps could be regarded as causing the dilution, (as but for each step no dilution would occur) but none of them by themselves is sufficient to bring about the dilution.
The question posed at [‎95] above, cannot therefore be answered by just considering whether approval of the Plan is a necessary or sufficient step in bringing about the dilution. The question needs to be considered having regard to the aims of section 901C(3), which very clearly are to prevent shareholders and creditors being bound into a plan without their consent.
The decision in Re Hurricane Energy was clearly a correct one. Shareholders, with no opportunity to vote were being affected directly by the Plan, both through losing their right to approve the issuance of more shares and issuance on a non-pre-emptive basis and, as a result of that, suffering dilution of their share rights. The judge was correct in identifying those types of effects, but it went without saying in that case that the second effect (dilution) was a direct consequence of the first (the loss of the ability to block the share issues giving rise to that dilution). In such circumstances (and especially where the matter is being dealt with, as it was in that case, at the convening hearing) it is clear that section 901C(3) should be engaged.
The question is very different when the shareholders have already voted and chosen to approve the issue of the MCBs, and their issuance on a non-pre-emptive basis, and have done so in full knowledge of the terms of the Plan. In that case it is artificial to say that their rights are being affected by the compromise or arrangement. Their rights have been fully respected and they have accepted the dilution of shareholding implicit in the Plan. It is hardly surprising that they shall have done so, as whilst the Plan does involve a dilution of their percentage shareholdings, this leads to an increase rather than a decrease in the value of those shareholdings.
In the current case, there would be no point in joining shareholders as a class to approve the Plan as they have already approved it in relation to the manner in which it has any effect on their rights - or rather the only point of doing so would be to create them as an extra potential cramming class – and had this been attempted I am quite sure that Long Corridor would have objected.
In my view Re Hurricane Energy should not be read outside its context where shareholders are being deprived of an ability to veto a non-pre-emptive issue of shares. Certainly, it has no application in the current case.
Having dealt with Condition A and Condition B, and having dismissed the late challenge to the composition of the classes, we have reached a position where it is open to me as the judge to sanction the Plan. Whether I should do so is the subject of the next section.
SHOULD THE PLAN BE SANCTIONED?
Both sides of the argument agreed that AGPS Bondco represented the best guidance as to how the court should approach its decision whether to implement a cross-class cram down.
It was held in that case, that the established principles that guide a court in the exercise of discretion to sanction a scheme of arrangement under Part 26 of the Companies Act 2006, in which all classes of creditors had voted in favour of the scheme, also applied where a restructuring plan under Part 26A had been approved by the required majority in each class meeting. Therefore in those circumstances, whilst, for the purposes of assessing the fairness of the plan,  the court would conduct a rationality check based on whether an honest and intelligent person might approve the plan as regards any class that had voted in favour, almost invariably that question would be answered by the very fact of the vote in favour at each class meeting (absent any reason why there was any suggestion that any members in the class were voting otherwise than in the interest of their class (for reasons such as those that I have considered  but dismissed in relation to China Life Franklin)).
However, where the cram down power in section 901G of the 2006 Act was sought to be invoked, the dissimilarity of interests meant (as Snowden LJ put it at [133]):
“the mere fact that one or more classes of creditors might have acted in their own separate interests in voting in favour of the plan said nothing about the commercial merits of the plan for a dissenting class or the fairness of imposing the plan on them.”
The court could not therefore apply a rationality test based on overall levels of support across all voting classes. Instead, the court had to look at questions of what has been referred to as “horizontal comparability”. As Snowden LJ went on to say at [159]:
“…a key issue for the court in exercising its discretion to impose a plan upon a dissenting class is to identify whether the plan provides for diﬀerences in treatment of the diﬀerent classes of creditors inter se and, if so, whether those diﬀerences can be justiﬁed. I also agree with Zacaroli J that an obvious reference point for this exercise must be the position of the creditors in the relevant alternative.”
and at [160]
“…In my judgment, that exercise of a judicial discretion to alter the rights of a dissenting class for the perceived beneﬁt of the assenting classes necessarily requires the court to inquire how the value sought to be preserved or generated by the restructuring plan, over and above the relevant alternative, is to be allocated between those diﬀerent creditor groups.
For these purposes, the Court is entitled to ask whether a better or fairer plan is available: see AGPS at [180]-[182].
A court would normally approve a plan which provides a pari passu distribution in relation to the beneﬁts of the restructuring over and above the distributions that could be expected in the relevant alternative. However, departure from the principle of pari passu distribution of the beneﬁts of the restructuring is permissible and can be approved by the court provided that there is a good reason or proper basis for that departure.
As between the different creditor groups in the case before me, it seems to me that the Plan Company has done its best to allocate fairly the value preserved or generated by the Plan over and above the relevant alternative. Whilst this has led to different groups of creditors who have (except for Class D) pari passu rights against the Plan Company receiving different values of Plan Consideration, this is explained by the fact that in the relevant alternative, the different classes would have different rights against other companies in the Plan Company’s Group and so would be anticipated to receive different recoveries. The Plan Company has tried to ensure that each class of creditor obtains a similar multiple of those recoveries as the value that it receives by way of Plan Consideration. As between the creditors of the different classes, I consider therefore that this departure is justified in that it produces what is sometimes referred to as a fair distribution of the benefits of the restructuring.
When I come to look at the effect of the Plan on shareholders, however, it is clear that they are obtaining disproportionate value out of the restructuring, since they would receive nothing in the relevant alternative, but are left holding a very substantial percentage of the shares which are reckoned to have a value as noted above. It may be considered then that they are getting “too good a deal” (to adopt the phrase used by Mann J in re Bluebrook Ltd [2010] 1 BCLC 338). The question arises whether there is any justification for this.
Long Corridor suggests that case law has identified only two matters which would justify this.
The first is the “gifting justification” – this is the justification that it is the wish of all classes of the “in the money” creditors that shareholders retain their equity. This justification proceeds on the basis that the “in the money” creditors are to be regarded as the economic owners of the business, such that it is up to them to determine how to divide up any value or potential future benefits which might be generated following implementation of a plan.
The second is the “new money justification” – this is where shareholders are providing some new money for the benefit of the restructuring.
I disagree that these two justifications that have been identified exhaust the possibilities of what may be a good justification. In AGPS Bondco Snowden LJ found that a departure from the principle of pari passu distribution of the benefits of a restructuring is permissible and can be approved by the court provided that there is a good reason or proper basis for that departure. As regards the question of what is a good reason or a proper basis he said (at [167]):
“In my judgment, it is neither possible nor advisable to attempt to prescribe an exhaustive list of the criteria that might qualify”.
Further, in AGPS Bondco another example was given of a position where there might be a good reason for a  plan to depart from treating everybody in the same way that they would be treated under the relevant alternative – it was considered (at [170]) that it could be justifiable for trade creditors not to be subjected to the same reduction of their claims as other unsecured creditors with whom they would rank equally in a formal insolvency as the continued supply of goods or services from those creditors might be regarded as essential for the continuation of the company’s business. Snowden LJ also considered (at [171] and [172]) that it was appropriate to consider analogies with established principles of insolvency law which might, for example, allow an administrator to make a payment to a creditor in full otherwise than in accordance with statutory rules if the administrator thinks it likely to assist the achievement of the purposes of the administration, or allow liabilities in respect of a property of a creditor (such as land leased to the company) to be treated as if they were expenses of the liquidation, and so have priority and be paid in full.
It can be seen from the examples put forward by Snowden LJ that, in considering whether there is a good reason or proper basis for departing from a division of the benefits of a restructuring plan that is strictly proportionate to how the different classes of creditor and shareholder would fare in the relevant alternative, the court takes a pragmatic view, focused on the overall interests of creditors.
In the case before me the Plan Company has put forward a justification for treating the shareholders substantially better than they would do in the relevant alternative (and disproportionately so in relation to the classes of creditors). This is that it considers that it is important that its two largest shareholders, China Life and Dajia Life Insurance Co. Ltd. (together the “SOE Shareholders”), both companies owned or controlled by the PRC should retain minimum holdings of 15% each, on the grounds that this would cause the Plan Company to continue to be regarded as a state-owned entity (“SOE”). This, the Plan Company argues, would provide various benefits to the Plan Company including receiving a more helpful reception by state organisations, for example in relation to planning matters and importantly a perception in the debt markets of being lower risk than a privately owned entity (“POE”).
This latter point is of great significance in relation to the valuation to be put on the Plan Consideration. It is argued that, as a SOE, the Plan Company would be able to avail itself of lower interest rates in the market than a POE (the term used to refer to entities that are regarded as not being SOEs). I will refer to this phenomenon as the “SOE/POE spread”. This in turn has an effect on the valuation of the Plan Consideration.
According to the Plan Company’s valuation expert, Mr Ben Johnson, the Plan Consideration is best valued, and would essentially in the market be valued, according to the discounted cash flow method. This method involves modelling the future cash flow expected in terms of interest payments and repayments of capital, and then discounting those numbers by an appropriate discount rate to arrive at a net present value (“NPV”) of this cashflow. According to Mr Johnson there would be a very substantial reduction in the discount rate to be used in calculating the NPV of the cash flow expected from the new debt obligations comprising the Plan Consideration. Mr Johnson considered that, if the Chinese-government-owned shareholders were diluted to below (or substantially below) the 15% each proposed under the Plan, the loss of this reduction in the discount rate would substantially reduce the current value of the Plan Consideration such that the returns for all classes of creditor would be considerably worse than the returns under the Plan – even if they were to receive more equity as proposed in Long Corridor’s Alternative Plan.
In Mr Johnson’s view, a suitable discount rate in the context of the Alternative Proposal (reflecting the SOE/POE spread, which he considered to be in the order of 5%) is in the range of 20% to 23%. Once the increased discount rate is applied, the NPV of the new debt instruments is materially reduced. In Mr Johnson’s view, the NPV of the new debt instruments under the Alternative Proposal would be US$615 million to US$728 million (with a mid-point of US$671.5 million). In contrast, under the Plan, the mid-point NPV of the new debt instruments is US$857 million – a difference of US$185.5 million. In effect, therefore, the Alternative Proposal (and any other proposal involving a substantially greater dilution of the SOE shareholders) reduces the real value of the new debt instruments by US$185.5 million.
Long Corridor objects to this analysis, and has drawn the attention of the court to various different official definitions of what is an SOE, and has advanced a suggestion that the SOE/POE spread applies only where the relevant SOE has a real prospect of being bailed out by the state.
Long Corridor produced expert evidence by Dr Shiyao Liu backing up these points. I did not find the evidence of this expert very helpful. It was based essentially on a textual analysis of a particular study and on analysing particular official uses of the term SOE, rather than on any sort of market expertise. I found the expert evidence of Mr Johnson to be far more helpful, as his analysis was based on market perceptions rather than on a particular statutory definition. His observations also chimed with common sense that operating within a jurisdiction like the PRC there would be advantages in being perceived as being a company in which the PRC had a significant interest.
It is important in this regard to consider what would happen if the SOE/POE spread is not 5% but instead some lower figure. Mr Johnson has modelled this point and has calculated that a SOE/POE spread of as low as 1% would also produce a worse outcome than the Plan.
Mr Johnson was cross examined on these points and proved a very credible witness. I accept his view that under the Plan the valuation of the Plan Consideration would be higher, as a result of the SOE/POE spread than under any alternative plan which involved issuing more shares, or more instruments convertible into shares to the creditors with the effect of diluting the existing shareholders down to a very small percentage of the shares.
In my view this point provides a good reason or proper basis for departing from a division of the benefits of a restructuring plan that is strictly proportionate to how the different classes of creditor and shareholder would fare in the relevant alternative. The evidence is that the Plan proposed is better for creditors than any alternative plan that would involve a substantially greater dilution of the existing shareholders.
I should, however, before leaving this topic deal with some further points raised by Long Corridor.
First, Long Corridor points out that it is not only the SOE Shareholders that benefit unduly under the Plan, but also the other existing shareholders who also retain a greater percentage of the shares than is warranted by comparison with how they would fare under the relevant alternative.
The Plan Company answers this point by saying that they have not been able to find any way in which these shareholders would be further diluted which would not also affect the SOE Shareholders, and for the reasons already discussed it is necessary to maintain a minimum 15% stake for the two SOE Shareholders. I can see the point in this and in my view this point does not affect the pragmatic reasons for retaining a minimum 15% each for the two SOE Shareholders.
Secondly, Long Corridor has made the point that under the terms of the Plan, if the share price were to increase before the MCBs were converted, it is possible that the shareholders could retain an even greater percentage of the equity, and no good reason has been put forward for this.
During the course of the hearing, I evinced sympathy for this point. In response the Plan Company has proposed a small amendment to the proposed draft order to include an undertaking by the Plan Company, the effect of which will be to prevent this possibility arising. This, I consider, deals satisfactorily with this point.
Thirdly, Long Corridor suggests that in an alternative plan where creditors are given substantially more equity, because some creditors are themselves SOEs the SOE/POE spread will anyway be maintained. I agree with the Plan Company that this is unlikely as the relevant creditors have evinced no appetite to hold equity and their elections under the Plan demonstrate this.
Finally, Long Corridor makes the point that, whilst the Plan Company is inviting creditors, and the court, to take account of the value of the SOE/POE spread as a reason to allow shareholders to retain more equity than is fair, there is no feature of the Plan that requires the SOE Shareholders to retain their shareholding for any period.
In response to this point, the Plan Company has argued that it has no reason to believe that the SOE Shareholders would not continue to retain their shareholdings, and the Plan Company will under the Plan undertake to use reasonable endeavours to request SOE Shareholders will do so.
I agree that this point is not particularly satisfactory and have been considering whether to impose a condition on approval of the court’s sanction of the Plan that an undertaking is obtained by the SOE Shareholders that they will retain their shares for a minimum period.
Since the hearing it has transpired that the SOE Shareholders are willing to provide such an undertaking, and indeed have provided such undertakings to the Plan Company. They each have agreed (conditional on the Restructuring going ahead by the Longstop Date as defined in the Plan) to retain their existing shares (but not any further shares that they might acquire in the Plan Company) for a period ending two years after the Restructuring Effective Date as defined in the Plan.
Long Corridor, whilst maintaining its principal position that the Plan should not be sanctioned at all, argues that the court should not approve the Plan unless undertakings are obtained lasting ten years rather than two.
Whilst I understand the logic of this stance, I consider that the undertaking provided goes a very long way towards persuading the court, and will go a long way towards persuading the market, that the SOE Shareholders will continue to support the Plan Company. It substantially mitigates the risk that they will, to use a hackneyed phrase, take the money and run.
In this regard, I note that the valuation evidence before the court valued the Plan Consideration on a basis assuming an SOE/POE spread would apply and must have reached this view without reliance on any undertaking that the SOE Shareholders would hold on to their shares for any period. The likelihood of the continuance of the SOE/POE spread at least for a minimum for two years is now greater than could have been assumed as part of that valuation.
In considering the effect of the Plan, the court is primarily concerned with the immediate effects of the Plan on affected creditors – there are limits on how far the court can look ahead. In this case, the combination of the valuation evidence and these undertakings is such that the court should accept that a valuation of the Plan Consideration should reflect the SOE/POE spread and that there is no significant imminent risk that this position will be falsified. Assuming that there is a market for the securities comprising the Plan Consideration, the Plan Creditors should be able to deal in the market at prices reflecting the SOE/POE spread.
CONCLUSION
Where there are dissenting classes, as well as checking that the formalities of the Plan have been observed, and that Conditions A and B as to the use of the cross-class cram down are satisfied, the court needs to decide whether to exercise its general discretion to sanction the restructuring plan.
I have no doubt in this case that the value split is substantially fair as regards the split between all the classes of creditors in the Plan.
The Plan may be seen as being unduly generous towards shareholders but there is a good reason for this. The continued retention of the two SOE Shareholders with a stake of 15% actually increases the value of the Plan to each class of Plan Creditors beyond that which they would enjoy in any alternative Plan not including this feature.
When considering whether the plan involves a fair distribution of the benefits of the restructuring the court is entitled to ask whether a better or fairer plan is available (in which regard, I refer again to AGPS at [180]-[182]). Certainly, the position now, where the evidence is that the Plan Company has only weeks before, in the absence of approval of the Plan it must go into insolvent liquidation is that there is no alternative. However, even if one goes back to the period before the Plan was finalised, on the evidence before me there is no plan which could have been put forward which would provide a better return to creditors by giving them substantially more equity, given my acceptance of the evidence relating to the importance of the SOE/POE spread.
The most that can be said is that it would have been better if the SOE/POE spread could have been better locked in for the full period of 10 years. However, I consider that the undertakings provided to hold the shares for two years goes sufficiently far to ensure that creditors will benefit from the SOE/POE spread for at least a substantial period. Those creditors who worry about the possibility that the SOE Shareholders will reduce their commitment to the Plan Company after two years will have ample time in which to sell any Plan Consideration that they obtain while an SOE/POE spread still applies.
I have had to ask myself whether the absence of longer assurances is by itself a reason not to approve the Plan. Against the background that the SOE Shareholders have undertaken to continue to hold their shares for at least two years and that there is no reason to believe that the SOE Shareholders will not retain their interest and support for the Plan Company for longer and having regard to the potentially disastrous consequences for all concerned of the Plan failing, I do not think that it is.
I do consider however that the draft order will need to be amended to include an undertaking by the Plan Company to the court to use all reasonable endeavours to enforce the undertakings provided by the SOE Shareholders.
With that caveat, I will approve the Plan.

MR JUSTICE SHELDON
Mr Justice Sheldon :
Introduction
The Claimant, the University and College Union, is a trade union and professional association for staff working in further and higher education. It has more than 120,000 members across the United Kingdom.
The Claimant has reason to believe that it has the been the victim of a ransomware cyber attack, with information confidential to the Claimant, its employees, clients and/or associated third parties, being obtained from its computer or IT system between the dates of 12 and 16 August 2024. On 16 August 2024, a voicemail message was received by the Claimant coming from the Defendants, or someone acting on behalf of the Defendants, making the Claimant aware that they had access to the information. It was subsequently discovered that some of the information had been uploaded onto a website.
An urgent application for an interim injunction was made by the Claimant, without notice. This was heard by Richard Spearman KC, sitting as a deputy judge of the High Court on 16 October 2024. The deputy judge sat in private, but gave his reasons in public. The deputy judge ordered the interim injunction against “Person(s) Unknown responsible for obtaining data from the [Claimant’s] IT systems on or about 12 August 2024 to 16 August 2024 and/or who has disclosed or is intending or threatening to disclose the information thereby obtained”. The interim injunction required the Defendants, among other things, to deliver up and/or delete and/or destroy the information in their possession, custody and control, and provide to the Claimant’s solicitors a witness statement confirming that these steps had been taken.
The deputy judge also ordered service of the Claim Form and any other documents outside the jurisdiction if required, being satisfied that England and Wales was the proper place in which to bring the claim. The deputy judge also gave permission to the Claimant to make service by alternative means. The Order made by the deputy judge afforded the Defendants the opportunity to vary or discharge the Order. Subsequent to the making of the Order, there was no engagement by the Defendants with the proceedings.
On 14 November 2024, Hill J extended the injunction to trial, gave directions, and made an Order for alternative service as there were concerns that initial service had not been effective. The Order afforded the Defendants the opportunity to vary or discharge the Order. The directions included a requirement for the Defendants to serve a Defence to the Particulars of Claim by 4pm on 12 December 2024.
Hill J provided written reasons for her decisions on 22 November 2024: see [2024] EWHC 2998 (KB), these included a quotation from the deputy judge’s reasons that had been given orally in open court, based on a note from counsel rather than from a transcript. Hill J noted that the directions that she was making contemplated that if the Defendants continued to decline to engage with the proceedings, the Claimant would make an application for default judgment and/or summary judgment in the near future.
The Claimant now seeks a default judgment pursuant to CPR r.12.3(1) and a final injunction. The Claimant also seeks derogations from open justice to protect the case papers. The Claimant invited the Court to determine this matter without a hearing.
Determination without a hearing
The Court has power to deal with an application on the papers without a hearing if the parties agree, or “if the court does not consider that a hearing would be appropriate”: see CPR r.23.8. I do not consider that a hearing would be appropriate in this particular case and will, therefore, determine the application without a hearing.
In taking this approach, I have regard to the analysis propounded by Warby J in Clarkson Plc v. Person(s) Unknown [2018] EWHC 417 (QB).
[7] It is unlikely that the Court could or would deal on the papers with an application for a final order that determines civil rights, if that way of proceeding was opposed by one of the parties. But there are cases like the present, where one party has failed to engage with the proceedings and has therefore expressed no view about the matter.  It is not necessary to decide whether that involves a waiver of the party’s rights. I did not consider a hearing to be ‘appropriate’ in this case, because it would have added to the expense of this claim without serving any sufficiently useful purpose. On the facts of this case, and this application, the open justice principle can be properly respected and compliance with Article 6 [ECHR] achieved without the need for a hearing.  That can be done by making the order and, through this judgment, publicising the fact it has been made and the basis for making it.  Indeed, a process of this kind may even represent a more practical and effective way to give effect to the open justice principle and the Convention requirement for a public judgment, than holding a hearing.
[8]  This is a claim brought against a Person or Persons Unknown and, as is quite common in such cases, the identity of the defendant(s) remains unknown.  So, there is nobody defending the claim who could benefit from the advantages that a hearing often brings with it for the litigant.  The case has not proceeded in secret.  There have already been two public hearings, at each of which a public judgment has been given and recorded.  Transcripts of those judgments are available as of right. There is little that has changed since the last hearing, at which I granted an interim order and gave a reasoned judgment explaining why.  This is not a case in which there is any likelihood that a public hearing of this application would be more effective in bringing the attention of others to matters of importance than the method I am adopting. Rather the contrary. Transcripts are not created or published as a matter of course. They are not often applied for by third parties. This written judgment, by contrast, will be posted on a public website.  The reality is that information about these proceedings will be more accessible, if the case is dealt with in this way, than it would be if the matter had been dealt with at a hearing”.
The same approach is called for in this case. The Defendants have not engaged with these proceedings, even though (as I will discuss further below) the Claimant has taken all practicable steps to notify the Defendants of this application and so the provisions of section 12(2) of the Human Rights Act 1998 are satisfied. I concur with what Hill J observed in her judgment at [15], “Given that the Defendant is an unidentified perpetrator of a cyber-attack, the clear inference is that [their non-engagement with the proceedings] is deliberate and that there is no intention of doing so”.
I also note, in this regard, that at earlier stages in the proceedings, judgments have been given in public, and this judgment will be made available to the public including by being posted on a public website. The effect of this is that appropriate information about this case will be accessible to the public. The only material that is not accessible is confidential material which was properly dealt with in private in any event by the deputy judge or is contained within confidential schedules that have been appropriately drafted. The public would not have had access to that material in any event even if the present application was considered at an oral hearing.
Default Judgment
In considering this application for a default judgment, I have looked carefully at the relevant provisions of the CPR as well as the judgment of Collins Rice J in Armstrong Watson LLP v Person(s) Unknown [2023] EWHC 1761 (KB), where the essential principles were described. At [12] – [13] of that judgment, Collins Rice J stated that:
According to CPR 12.3, the basic conditions to be satisfied for entering default judgment are that a claimant has duly filed and served a claim form and particulars of claim, the defendant has not filed acknowledgment of service or defence to the claim, and the time for doing so has expired.
CPR 12.12(1) directs a court considering a default judgment application to ‘give such judgment as the claimant is entitled to on the statement of case’. I have directed myself to the guidance set out in Glenn v Kline [2020] EWHC 3182 (QB) at [24]-[27] as to the correct approach to applying this rule. Nicklin J said this:
[25] Although, under this rule, the Court must consider the judgment to which the claimant is entitled, the effect of default judgment is that the pleaded facts are treated as established. If those facts support the cause of action, the Court need go no further. The purpose of the requirement for an application is either to enable the court to tailor the precise relief, so that it is appropriate to the cause of action asserted, or otherwise to scrutinise the application in particular circumstances calling for more than a purely administrative response. Within these parameters, the Court must make an assessment of whether the applicant is entitled to the default judgment sought, or to some lesser or different default judgment: Football Dataco Ltd -v-Smoot Enterprises [2011] 1 WLR 1978 [16]-[19] per Briggs J.
[26] Evidence going to the merits is not required. The relief granted will normally be sought and granted on the basis of the claimant's statement of case.
That procedure is efficient and proportionate. Such a judgment is final and, to the extent it involves consideration of what relief is justified on the basis of the facts alleged in the statement of case, it does have an element of merits assessment: QRS -v- Beach [2015] 1 WLR 2701 [53] per Warby J.
Approved Judgment Armstrong Watson v Persons Unknown
[27] In Brett Wilson LLP -v- Person(s) Unknown [2016] 4 WLR 69, Warby J explained:
[18] The claimant's entitlement on such an application is to ""such judgment as it appears to the court that the claimant is entitled to on his statement of case"": CPR r 12.11(1) [CPR 12.12(1)]. I accept Mr Wilson's submission that I should interpret and apply those words in the same way as I did in Sloutsker -v- Romanova [2015] EWHC 2053 (QB) [84]:
""This rule enables the court to proceed on the basis of the claimant's unchallenged particulars of claim. There is no need to adduce evidence or for findings of fact to be made in cases where the defendant has not disputed the claimant's allegations. That in my judgment will normally be the right approach for the court to take. Examination of the merits will usually involve unnecessary expenditure of time and resources and hence [be] contrary to the overriding objective. It also runs the risk of needlessly complicating matters if an application is later made to set aside the default judgment: see QRS -v- Beach [2015] 1 WLR 2701 esp at [53]-[56].""
[19] As I said in the same judgment at para 86:""the general approach outlined above could need modification in an appropriate case, for instance if the court concluded that the claimant's interpretation of the words complained of was wildly extravagant and impossible, or that the words were clearly not defamatory in their tendency.""
Those instances of circumstances which might require departure from the general rule are not exhaustive, but only examples. I have considered whether there is any feature of the present case that might require me to consider evidence, rather than the claimant's pleaded case, verified by a statement of truth and uncontradicted by the defendants. I do not think there is any such feature. I have therefore proceeded on the basis of the pleaded case, both in my introductory description of the facts above, and in reaching the conclusion that the claimant has established its right to recover damages for libel, and to appropriate injunctions to ensure that the libel is not further published by the defendants”.
The Claim form and Particulars of Claim in this case make it clear that this is a breach of confidence case. The essential elements of a breach of confidence claim are pleaded:
the information with which we are concerned has the necessary quality of confidence;
the information has been obtained by the Defendants without consent or authorisation, and in circumstances where that was known by the Defendants;
the Defendants knew or ought to have known that the Claimant reasonably expected the information to be private or confidential and to remain so, and that the Defendant was not entitled to publish or use it without the consent of the Claimant;
the Defendants therefore owed the Claimant a duty of confidence in respect of the information; and
by obtaining, retaining, and disclosing the information or threatening to do so, the Defendants are in breach of confidence.
The Particulars of Claim set out the allegations of fact in relation to each of these elements. They describe the identity and nature of the information, the circumstances in which it was obtained, and the fact of disclosure.
In these circumstances, it is clear to me that the cause of action for breach of confidence is made out, and the facts alleged are sufficient to support that cause of action.
I am also satisfied that the Defendants have not complied with the Order of Hill J as they have failed to file and serve a Defence to the Particulars of Claim by 4pm on 12 December 2024. Indeed, they have not filed and served a Defence at all, nor has there been any response to this application. This is in spite of the fact that the Claimant has, on the basis of the evidence presented to the Court, which I accept, complied with the service requirements mandated by the previous Orders. The Claim Form was served on the Defendants on 23 October 2024; and the Particulars of Claim were served on 6 November 2024. The Order of Hill J was served on the Defendants on 18 November 2024.
The Defendants have not indicated that they are outside the jurisdiction. Even if they are, the time limits for filing acknowledgment of service or Defence have long since expired.
Adam Speker KC and Ben Gallop, counsel for the Claimant, have correctly drawn my attention to the recent judgment of Nicklin J in Chirkunov v Person(s) Unknown [2024] EWHC 3177 (KB). In that case, the learned judge refused the claimant’s application for permission to serve out of the jurisdiction a claim form on defendant persons unknown.
In Chirkunov, Nicklin J looked carefully at CPR r.6.37(1), and in particular (1)(c) which states that an application for permission to serve outside of the jurisdiction requires the applicant to set out “the defendant’s address or, if not known, in what place the defendant is, or is likely, to be found”. On its face, therefore, there is a requirement at least to identify where the defendant is, or is likely to be, located. Nicklin J considered the question as to how that requirement can be satisfied if the claimant is seeking to serve against persons unknown and does not know where they reside or are likely to reside. Nicklin J analysed this matter in some detail but did not reach a conclusion that non-compliance with CPR r.6.37(1)(c), or a failure to identify where the defendant is or was likely to be found, was necessarily fatal to an application for service out of the jurisdiction: see [90]. Nicklin J’s observations about that rule are, therefore, obiter.
In the course of his judgment, Nicklin J pointed out that he had been referred to a number of cases in which the Court had granted permission to serve a claim form out of the jurisdiction where the location of the defendant was not known. This included an earlier judgment in the proceedings between Armstrong Watson LLP v Persons Unknown: see [2023] 4 WLR 1. Nicklin J observed at [87] that in none of those cases was any attention paid to CPR r.6.37(1)(c), and so they did not provide assistance in analysing the meaning and effect to be given to that part of the CPR.
Nicklin J also stated that:
“the circumstances in which these decisions came to be made – often urgent interim injunction applications where only one party was represented – mean that the fact that CPR 6.37(1)(c) was not considered is not altogether surprising. Many of the cases were instances where, wherever the defendant was located, the assessment of appropriate forum plainly favoured England & Wales. In several of the cases, the grant of permission to serve the Claim Form out of the jurisdiction was very much an insurance against a possibility that the defendant turned out not to be within the jurisdiction of the Court. Not all cases will be that straightforward.”
These circumstances also apply to the present case. The application to serve the claim form out of the jurisdiction was considered by the deputy judge at the same time as the Claimant’s application for an urgent injunction. The precise wording and effect of CPR 6.37(1)(c) does not appear to have been considered by the deputy judge. The application to serve out of the jurisdiction was an “insurance policy”, in case the Defendants did reside outside of England and Wales. Furthermore, the Claimant argued that England and Wales is the proper place in which to bring this claim given that it is based in England, and this appears to have been accepted by the deputy judge as it is mentioned in his Order, albeit not in the reasons that he gave for his decision. I note, in passing, that in Chirkunov, Nicklin J did not regard the proper place for considering the claimant’s claim for breach of his data protection rights as being in England Wales: see [82]. It was for this reason that the learned judge declined to exercise his discretion to permit service of the claim form out of the jurisdiction.
I do not need to decide at this stage of the proceedings whether non-compliance with CPR r.6.37(1)(c), or a failure to identify where the Defendants are or are likely to be found, should have been fatal to the Claimant’s application for service out of the jurisdiction. The Order granting that application has been made by the deputy judge, and the Defendants have not sought to set it aside or vary it. They can still do so if they engage with these proceedings.
I am persuaded, for the reasons given above, that the other elements for obtaining a default judgment are satisfied. Accordingly, I allow the Claimant’s application and grant default judgment against the Defendants.
Remedy
I grant the application for a final injunction: (i) prohibiting the Defendants from using, publishing, communicating or disclosing the information; and (ii) ordering the Defendants to deliver up and/or delete and/or destroy the information, and to provide a witness statement with a statement of truth explaining their compliance.
The remedy of a final injunction is appropriate in this case, given that (i) default judgment has been granted; (ii) the Defendants have failed to engage with these proceedings and have not complied with the previous Orders; and (iii) there is, in my judgment, a high risk that unless restrained by, and subject to the terms of, a final injunction the Defendants will continue to breach the confidence that they owe to the Claimant.
Order
I also make the Order sought by the Claimant which includes the payment of costs by the Defendants, the opportunity for the Defendants to apply to vary or discharge the order, and for there to be continuing supervision of the Court with respect to access and use of documents prepared for this litigation so as to protect the Claimant’s confidentiality. The latter order is strictly necessary to maintain the effectiveness of the relief that I am granting.

TRIBUNAL JUDGE HAZEL OLIVER

MAESDU GARAGE LTD
Appellant
and
THE PENSIONS REGULATOR
Respondent
Decision:
1. The proceedings are struck out under Rule 8(3)(a) for failure to comply with a direction of the Tribunal.
REASONS
This is an appeal against penalty notices issued to the Appellant by the Pensions Regulator.
Under Rule 8(3)(a) of the Tribunal Procedure (First-tier Tribunal) (General Regulatory Chamber) Rules 2009, the Tribunal may strike out the whole or a part of the proceedings if the appellant has failed to comply with a direction which stated that failure by the appellant to comply with the direction could lead to the striking out of the proceedings or part of them.
The Appellant’s appeal form is dated 31 July 2024. It was not received by the Tribunal until 11 October 2024, when it was sent by email. The appeal form as received by the Tribunal does not include an application for an extension of time. The applicable time limit is 28 days from the Pension Regulator’s review decision letter, which according to the appeal documents was 9 July 2024.
On 28 October 2024 the Tribunal wrote to the Appellant to explain that the appeal appears to be late, but the Appellant had not completed section 6 of Form GRC1. This section states, “If your appeal is late, or you are not sure if it will be received in time, explain why and include any supporting evidence you have when sending this form”.
The directions attached to the Tribunal’s email required the Appellant to provide everything that is required by the rules within 28 days. The list of requirements includes, “where a notice of appeal is provided later than the applicable time limit, a request for an extension of time and the reason why the notice of appeal was not provided in time”. These directions also say, “If you do not comply with paragraph 4, then this could lead to your appeal being struck out. This is a formal notice under rule 8(3)(a)”.
The Appellant has not replied to this correspondence and has not complied with the directions to request an extension of time and provide reasons.
I note that the emailed version of the appeal form does include an envelope which seems to be addressed to the Tribunal. It includes a number of labels with some dates in August 2024. There is a label showing that the item was not delivered because it was not collected which is dated 25 August. There is also an item underpaid label which shows a fee to pay of £1.50. The Appellant did not provide an adequate explanation of this item when sending it to the Tribunal or make an application for an extension of time in section 6 of the appeal form. This is not sufficient information for the Tribunal to make a decision on whether time should be extended – particularly when the appeal was not emailed until October 2024.
I consider that it was necessary for the Appellant to comply with the Tribunal’s directions in order for the Tribunal to decide whether the appeal could proceed. The Appellant has not complied, and they were warned that this could lead to the appeal being struck out. Having considered all the circumstances, I strike out the appeal under Rule 8(3)(a).

Mr Justice Dove
Introduction
In this case the claimants renew their application for permission to apply for judicial review, having been refused permission on the papers by Freedman J on 2024-August-22. The hearing of this renewed application was greatly assisted by the careful preparation of the electronic bundles which were provided to the court, and I place on record my thanks to all who appeared for their focussed and helpful written and oral submissions.
The circumstances giving rise to this judicial review are as follows. The first claimant is the father of Indi Gregory, a baby who tragically became critically ill and the subject of litigation in relation to her care and treatment in October and November 2023. It appears from the papers that Indi suffered from an extremely rare mitochondrial condition along with comorbidities which led to her requiring full life support from early September 2023. On 2023-October-16 Peel J, the judge with conduct of Indi’s case, approved a care plan permitting the withdrawal of invasive treatment and its replacement with palliative care. This care plan was resisted by Indi’s parents.
At the hearing before me the first claimant explained the unimaginably distressing and tragic circumstances in which he and Indi’s mother found themselves as a result of Indi’s serious ill-health. Their daughter was critically ill, and they were faced with an application by the Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust (“the Trust”) to the Family Court to authorise the withdrawal of Indi’s life support as described above. The first claimant had sought the opportunity to take Indi to Italy for treatment for her condition, but that had been refused. Thereafter the first claimant made an application to Peel J for permission for Indi to be extubated at home rather than, as the Trust proposed, in a hospice. Peel J refused that application, and the first claimant made an application for permission to appeal to the Court of Appeal, who conducted an oral hearing sitting in a constitution comprised of the interested parties.
In his submissions to me the first claimant expressed his concern, subsequently set out in the complaint to the first defendant, that during the course of giving an ex tempore judgment on 2023-November-10 dismissing the application, the first interested party had passed comments which were both insulting to Indi’s parents and also the legal team acting for them. In effect, the first claimant submitted, the comments amounted to making of accusations of misleading behaviour and dishonesty against the claimants. The first claimant submitted that this was quite inappropriate and occurred at an extraordinarily difficult time for himself and his wife.
The second claimant is the solicitor instructed on behalf of the first claimant in the application before Peel J and the subsequent appeal to the Court of Appeal. Whilst at the time of the appeal he was a trainee solicitor, in the interim and prior to the hearing before me he has been admitted to the Roll. The second claimant also complains about the comments in relation to his conduct of the case which were made by the first interested party in giving judgment in the case.
The judgment and the complaint
The leading judgment of the Court of Appeal was given by the first interested party. It is appropriate for present purposes to focus on those aspects of the judgment to which the claimants take objection. In paragraph 6 of the judgment the first interested party noted a number of recent developments in the case including, whilst identifying that it was not a matter before the court, an initiative taken by an official of the Italian Consulate in the UK, who “purported to issue a decree appointing a guardian for Indi and authorising her removal to Italy for treatment”. The first interested party went on to observe that “the argument that the Italian authorities are better able than the English court to determine Indi’s best interests is in our view wholly misconceived and a request of this nature is clearly contrary to the spirit of [the Hague Convention]”.
At paragraph 13 and 14 of the judgment the first interested party made the following observations having set out the grounds upon which the application was based.
Before coming to consider these arguments, it must be observed that there is, to say the least, a sense of unreality surrounding this latest application. Before us the parents are seeking an order leading to an outcome that Indi should be extubated at home, but in reality they (or those who they have entrusted with their legal representation) are taking steps to prevent the court’s decision from being carried into effect at all. I have already mentioned the issue of a transfer of the proceedings to Italy. Although the father’s statement before the judge stated that the parents fully understood that the court has already declined the proposal of a transfer to Rome and that the decisions of the UK courts would have to be followed, it would appear that the parents continue to seek an outcome whereby extubation does not take place and that, far from returning home, Indi should be transferred abroad for operative treatment.
Then, it transpired that during the midday break in the hearing of this appeal, Mr Pavel Stroilov, a trainee solicitor instructing Mr Quintavalle, who was in the same room as him during his submissions this morning, had sent a letter and a witness statement to the judge in an apparent attempt to persuade him to reopen his welfare decision. Mr Quintavalle was asked a number of questions by the court about this, but I am not yet clear what he knew about this further initiative before he addressed us this morning, or what control is being exercised over the trainee solicitor’s actions in this case. I do not propose to say more about that now, but we will take whatever action seems appropriate in due course.”
The first interested party then proceeded to examine the grounds upon which the application was advanced, and for the reasons which he gave concluded that the grounds of the application were “entirely without merit”. The first interested party concluded his judgement in paragraph 22 in the following terms:
Before leaving this matter, I would add the following. Although this is a legal decision, it is taken with a full awareness of the deeply sensitive question that lies at the heart of the proceedings. Indi’s Guardian, who firmly opposes this application because of the continuing distress to Indi caused by the delays, rightly acknowledges that her parents love her fiercely and that it is impossible for us to fully comprehend their current circumstances. Nevertheless, I wish to express my profound concern about the approach that has developed in this litigation. The judge has throughout approached the assessment of Indi’s welfare in a fair and sensible way and has reached decisions, of which the latest is but one, that were based on strong evidence that had been carefully tested. In the 25 days since his decision of October, a period during which good arrangements could have been made for Indi’s benefit, there have been no fewer than six court hearings, each of them requiring very significant preparation and distraction of attention from Indi herself. As Ms Sutton says, a fair hearing has to be fair to everyone, and I would add, most of all to Indi. The increasing demands and changing positions of the parents have been extremely challenging for the clinicians, who have not only to look after Indi but twelve other critically ill children on the ward. The highest professional standards are rightly expected of lawyers practising in this extremely sensitive area. The court will not tolerate manipulative litigation tactics designed to frustrate orders that have been made after anxious consideration in the interests of children, interests that are always central to these grave decisions.”
Sadly, two days after the hearing before the Court of Appeal, Indi passed away.
On 10 February 2024 the claimants lodged a complaint with the first defendant in respect of the conduct of the three interested parties. In the introduction to the complaint it was stated that it “concerns inappropriate and offensive comments made by [the first interested party] in an ex tempore judgement refusing permission to appeal in Gregory v Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust [2023] EWCA Civ 1324 (10 November 2023). [The first interested party’s] comments were then unreservedly endorsed by [the second interested party] and [the third interested party].”
The complaint was made on a number of discrete and specified grounds. Complaint one was that the observations of the first interested party in the judgment included inappropriate comments in respect of the outstanding request from the Italian judicial authorities under article 9 of the Hague Convention. The complaint included the submission that the suggestion that this request was “wholly misconceived” interfered in the determination of the merits of an application which was currently sub judice and before Peel J. Furthermore, some of the comments passed implied that the first claimant had conceded that the request should be refused, as well as insinuating that the request had not been validly made. It was submitted that the first claimant had not conceded in his evidence that the UK courts should retain jurisdiction to determine the welfare of Indi, he had merely acknowledged the necessity of obeying the UK courts orders whether or not he agreed with them.
Complaint two was that the first interested party’s comments in paragraphs 14 and 22 of the judgment carried the implication that the contents of correspondence sent by the first claimant’s solicitors to Peel J were seriously inappropriate, leading to a suspicion that the second claimant must have sent it without proper supervision and in a manner which raised professional conduct issues for solicitors and/or counsel. These observations were likely (and apparently intended) to influence Peel J’s reaction to the correspondence when considering it in due course. The matters raised in the correspondence had no relevance to the application before the Court of Appeal. The complaint was accompanied by copies of the relevant correspondence to support the contention that the observations of the first interested party were unjustified.
Complaint three was that in the first interested party’s judgment there were insinuations of serious allegations against Indi’s parents. The complaint relied upon the observation that the application had a sense of unreality about it, along with the suggestion that the first interested party had implied in paragraph 13 of the judgment that the first claimant’s witness statement was misleading. It was also contended under this heading that stating in paragraph 16 of the judgement that “the parents exercising their legal rights to the fullest extent, at least” implied that they had exceeded their legal rights. Objection was also taken to paragraph 22 when it was observed that the “increasing demands and changing positions of the parents have been extremely challenging for the clinicians, who have not only to look after Indi but twelve other critically ill children on the ward.” It was submitted that there was no basis for any of these observations and that they were grossly insensitive, in particular with respect to Indi’s mother who had not actively participated in the proceedings.
Complaint four related to concerns in relation to the insinuation of serious allegations against the first claimant’s lawyers. In particular, the complaint relies upon the strong criticisms of the Italian proceedings, which were portrayed as an example of improper and manipulative litigation tactics designed to frustrate orders made in the UK courts. Further, the comments in paragraph 14 in relation to the correspondence and the comments upon Mr Quintavalle’s ability to answer the court’s questions further implied that this correspondence was a manipulative litigation tactic. These observations and insinuations were not justified, and the first claimant’s lawyers had acted carefully and on instructions at all times, deploying the highest professional standards.
The substance of complaint five was that it was clear from the terms of the first interested party’s judgement that he intended to convey his anger, or at the very least irritation, against Indi’s parents and the lawyers who represented them. It was inappropriate for the first interested party to display his emotions in open court “by littering his extempore judgement with irrelevant derogatory comments directed at the parents, [the first claimant’s] lawyers, or the Italian Consul.”
The complaint noted that the second and third interested parties both gave judgments stating simply that they agreed with the judgment of the first interested party. By doing so it was submitted that they associated themselves fully with all of the first interested party’s comments which they knew, or ought to have known, were improper for the reasons set out in the complaint.
On 23 February 2024 the first defendant responded to the claimants in relation to the complaint which they had lodged. In both cases the first defendant refused to accept the complaint for consideration. The reasons provided for why the first defendant could not accept the complaint was the same in both instances. It was expressed as follows:
“When considering complaints, the JCIO is required to follow the Judicial Conduct Rules 2023 (“the 2023 Rules”), which are available to view on our website.
Rule 10 (a) of the 2023 Rules states that the JCIO must not accept a complaint which does not meet the requirements of Rule 8. To comply with Rule 8(c), a complaint must-
“contain an allegation of misconduct about a named or identifiable person holding an office, which is supported by relevant details as specified in guidance published by the JCIO from time to time.”
We cannot accept your complaint because it does not comply with Rule 8(c). The appendices, attached to this letter, contain more information about why we cannot accept complaints because they do not comply with Rule 8(c).
Having assessed your complaint, matters which you have raised relate to judicial decision and judicial case management in which the JCIO do not have the authority to intervene.
Please note that while we recognise you might not agree with our decision, it is final.”
Appendix A which was attached to the decisions given to both claimants provides information to explain why the first defendant cannot accept complaints which do not comply with Rule 8(c) of the Judicial Conduct Rules 2023 (“the 2023 Rules”). In particular, in relation to allegations of misconduct the following information is provided.
“Allegation of misconduct.
-This means that your complaint is about a judges personal behaviour, not about a decision order which they have made, or how they have managed a case.
-Examples of common complaints which we cannot accept because they are about judicial decision and case management, include:
-bias in a judges decision-making
-allowing one party to speak for longer than another
-refusing to allow a party to give certain evidence or submit certain documents
-appearing to react more favourably to one person’s evidence than another’s
-a judge saying that they do not believe a person’s evidence, questioning a person’s credibility or criticising a person’s actions
-a judge making an error of law or procedure-a judge making an incorrect order or refusing to make an order
-a judge expressing opinions about issues or parties related to a case they are hearing
-a judge not reading documents before a hearing
-a judge refusing to transfer a case to a different judge or court
-a judge reserving a case to themselves
-a judge refusing to correspond with the party about a case.”
Appendix B which was also attached to the first defendant’s decisions in each case provides guidance on what is meant by “relevant details”, and advises that if a complaint relates to something a judge said, for example rudeness or something in their tone or manner, then the details required would include the words that the judge used, a description of the judge’s tone or manner, or if the complaint related to laughing inappropriately, the context of that behaviour. In addition to these appendices the first defendant’s decisions provided details of the second defendant and the opportunity to complain to them.
On 18 March 2024 the claimants wrote to the second defendant complaining of the failure of the first defendant to investigate their complaints against the interested parties and to comply with the procedures prescribed by the 2023 Rules. On 26 March 2024 the second defendant responded separately to each claimant following completion of preliminary investigations into the claimants’ complaints and including a report of that preliminary investigation. In the report the second defendant explains that the remit which is being exercised precludes a review of the substance of the decisions taken but is confined to the process by which the complaints were handled by the first defendant.
The essence of the conclusions reached by the second interested party, adjusted to reflect that the rejections of both claimants’ complaint, were in similar terms, and were as follows.
“The JCIO’s assessment that it could not investigate [the claimants’] complaint because it was outside its statutory remit and did not contain an allegation of misconduct about a named or identifiable person holding an office, which is supported by relevant details, as set out in the Rule 8(c) of the Judicial Conduct Rules 2023. This assessment was, taking into account all the information provided by [the claimants] consistent with the explanation it gave, and the appropriate legislation. Whilst it is not within my remit to comment on the decisions made by the JCIO, it is important to point out that there are two elements to Rule 8(c) that need to be met for the JCIO to accept a complaint for assessment. The first, is to provide the name of the judicial office holder complained about, and the second, is that a complaint also needs to include “an allegation of misconduct which is supported by relevant details as specified in guidance published by the JCIO from time to time”. Although [the complainant’s have] asserted in [their] complaint to my office that [they] had met the requirements of Rule 8, it is for the JCIO to assess whether the allegations about the personal conduct of a judicial office holder were supported by the details specified in the JCIO guidance (as set out in Appendix B). Having considered the correspondence carefully, I can see no issue with the JCIO’s handling of this complaint.
The JCIO explained that “we cannot accept your complaint because it does not comply with Rule 8(c). The appendices attached to this letter, contain more information about why we cannot accept complaints because they do not comply with Rule 8(c). Having assessed your complaint, the matters which you have raised relate to judicial decision and judicial case management which the JCIO do not have the authority to intervene in. Please note that while we recognise you might not agree with our decision, it is final”. Having considered the correspondence in this complaint carefully, I can see no issue with the process followed by the JCIO in its assessment of his complaint.”
The second defendant concluded the report into the complaint by again noting that the enquiry to be undertaken in response to the complaint was limited to the process followed by the first defendant in  dealing with the claimants’ complaints, and that the second defendant had found no issues with procedure that the first defendant followed. The claimants complaints were rejected.
On 24 May 2024 the claimants brought these proceedings for judicial review.
The law
Disciplinary powers in relation to judicial office holders were given to the Lord Chancellor by virtue of the provisions of the Constitutional Reform Act 2005. Section 3 of the 2005 Act guarantees the independence of the judiciary in the following terms.
“3 Guarantee of continued judicial independence
the Lord Chancellor, other Ministers of the Crown and all with responsibility for matters relating to the judiciary or otherwise to the administration of justice must uphold the continued independence of the judiciary.
…
The following particular duties are imposed for the purpose of upholding that independence.
The Lord Chancellor and other Ministers of the Crown must not seek to influence particular judicial decisions through any special access to the judiciary.
the Lord Chancellor must have regard to-
the need to defend that independence,
the need for the judiciary to have the support necessary to enable them to exercise their functions;
the need for the public interest in regard to matters relating to the judiciary or otherwise to the administration of justice to be properly represented in decisions affecting those matters.”
Section 108 of the 2005 Act provides the power for the Lord Chancellor, or the Lady Chief Justice with the agreement of the Lord Chancellor, to exercise disciplinary powers in respect of judicial office holders in the form of sanctions such as the giving of formal advice, formal warning or reprimand. In furtherance of the exercise of these powers section 115 and 116 of the 2005 Act provide as follows.
“115 Regulations about procedures
The Lord Chief Justice may, with the agreement of the Lord Chancellor, make regulations providing for the procedures that are to be followed in-
the investigation and determination of allegations by any person of misconduct by judicial office holders;
reviews and investigations (including the making of applications or references) under sections 110 to 112.
116 Contents of Regulations
Regulations under section 115 (a) may include provision as to any of the following-
circumstances in which an investigation must or may be undertaken (on the making of a complaint or otherwise);
steps to be taken by a complainant before a complaint is to be investigated;
the conduct of an investigation, including steps to be taken by the officeholder under investigation or by a complainant or other person;
time limits for taking any step and procedures for extending time limits;
persons by whom an investigation or part of an investigation is to be conducted;
matters to be determined by the Lord Chief Justice, the Lord Chancellor, the officeholder under investigation or any other person;
requirements as to records of investigations;
requirements as to confidentiality of communications or proceedings;
requirements as to the publication of information or its provision to any person.”
The opportunity for an interested person to make an application to the second defendant for a review the exercise of these disciplinary powers is specified in section 110 of the 2005 Act in the following terms.
“110 Applications to the Ombudsman
this section applies if an interested party makes an application to the Ombudsman for the review of the exercise by any person of a regulated disciplinary function, on the grounds that there has been-
a failure to comply with prescribed procedures, or
some other maladministration.
the Ombudsman must carry out a review if the following three conditions are met.
the first condition is that the Ombudsman considers that a review is necessary.
the second condition is that-
the application is made within the permitted period,
the application is made within such longer period as the Ombudsman considers appropriate in the circumstances, or
the application is made on grounds alleging undue delay and the Ombudsman considers that the application has been made within a reasonable time.
the third condition is that the application is made in a form approved by the Ombudsman.
but the Ombudsman may not review the merits of a decision made by any person.”
The then Lord Chief Justice exercised the powers conferred by sections 115, 116, 117, 120 and 121 of the 2005 Act in making the Judicial Discipline (Prescribed Procedures) Regulations 2023. The 2023 Regulations were made on 13 September 2023 and came into force on 13 October 2023. The first defendant is the body designated pursuant to Regulation 4 of the 2023 Regulations for the purpose of performing the functions specified by the Regulations. Regulation 6 requires that complaints about a judicial officeholder must be made to the first defendant (with one exception which is of no relevance to these proceedings). Regulation 7 of the 2023 Regulations makes provision for the Lady Chief Justice, with the agreement of the Lord Chancellor, to make rules about the process to be applied in respect of a complaint to the first defendant. The Judicial Conduct Rules 2023 are the rules which have been made pursuant to this provision.
The 2023 Rules contain provisions in relation to the making of a complaint about misconduct on the part of a judicial officeholder. Rules 6 and 7 provide that a complaint must be made to the first defendant using the online portal unless otherwise agreed. The provisions of particular relevance to the present case are contained within rules 8 to 10 as follows.
A complaint must-
state the name of the person making the complaint;
state the address or email address of the person making the complaint;
contain an allegation of misconduct on the part of an identified or identifiable person holding an office, which is supported by relevant details as specified in guidance published by the JCIO from time to time;
state the date, or dates, that the alleged misconduct took place unless the JCIO decides that this is unnecessary taking into account all the circumstances of the complaint.
A complaint must be accompanied by copies of all the documents within the control of the complainant to which they intend to refer.
The JCIO must not accept a complaint in any case where one or both of the following applies-
the complaint does not meet the requirements set out in rules 6 to 9;
the complainant states that they do not want the officeholder concerned to see a copy of the complaint or of any document accompanying it.”
Rule 22 of the 2023 rules provides that a complaint “must initially be considered” by the first defendant. Thereafter, rules 23 and 24 of the 2023 rules make the following provisions:
The JCIO must dismiss a complaint, or part of a complaint, if it falls into one or more of the following categories-
the alleged facts are obviously untrue;
even if the alleged facts were true, they would not require a disciplinary sanction to be issued;
it is about a judicial decision or judicial case management, and raises no question of misconduct;
it is vexatious;
it is misconceived;
it raises a matter which has already been dealt with, whether under these Rules or otherwise, and does not present any significant new evidence;
it is about the private life or the professional conduct in a non-judicial capacity of a person holding an office and raises no question of misconduct;
for any other reason it does not relate to misconduct by a person holding an office.
If it appears, following initial consideration, that none of the criteria for dismissal of a complaint in rule 23 apply the JCIO must make such enquiries as it considers reasonable and proportionate to establish the facts of the case.”
Pursuant to the provisions of Rule 8(c) the first defendant provides guidance on its website in respect of how to make a complaint and what a person can complain about. Much of this material reflects what was set out in the appendices to the first defendant’s decisions in this case. In particular, the online guidance provides the following in respect of an allegation of misconduct.
“What does an “allegation of misconduct” mean? An allegation of misconduct means that your complaint is about a judge’s personal behaviour, not about a decision or order which they have made, or how they have managed a case. It means you believe that the judges personal behaviour has fallen below the standards of conduct in the Guide to Judicial Conduct.”
Further material on the first defendant’s website emphasises that they can only deal with complaints about the personal conduct of judicial office holders, not about a judge’s decision or the way in which a judge has managed a case. Examples of what might amount to misconduct include, amongst other matters, bullying or harassment, using racist, sexist or other offensive language and a loss of temper or rudeness, for example by shouting.
There has been little judicial consideration of the provisions governing the activities of the first defendant. However, in R(on the application of Hammersmith and Fulham LBC [2016] EWHC 2849 (Admin) Soole J dealt with a renewed application for permission to apply for judicial review in respect of the  refusal of the first defendant to investigate a local authority’s complaint of alleged misconduct by a Senior Coroner. The nature of the misconduct was that it was alleged that the Senior Coroner had held a significant number of hearings after office hours, and the dates and times of those hearings which had been taken from digitally recorded transcripts did not correspond with the dates recorded in the court diary for the Senior Coroner. As a result of that alleged mismatch appropriate notification of the hearings could not have been given pursuant to the relevant regulatory regime. The first defendant refused to consider the local authority’s complaint on the basis that, having clarified that it was not suggested that the Senior Coroner had falsified any records, this was a complaint about a judicial decision and not misconduct. Soole J concluded, refusing permission to apply for judicial review, as follows:
In these circumstances, I see no properly arguable case for submitting that the decision was unlawful. Whether there has been a breach of the Coroner’s Rules on one or multiple occasions, that is prima facie the consequence of a judicial decision which falls outside the remit of the JCIO. If breaches occur, they fall to be determined through the judicial process, including, as I have indicated, judicial review.”
This decision was one which was reached at the permission stage and in circumstances somewhat different from the present case. Other decisions were cited in the course of argument but were of limited assistance in relation to the issues before the court.
Submissions
As against the first defendant the claimants bring their case on five grounds. Ground 1 is that the first defendant erred in law in concluding that the complaint was outside its remit on the basis that it related to comments made whilst giving judgment. The claimants submit that the comments upon which they rely were wholly unconnected to the issues which were before the interested parties and upon which they were required to adjudicate. There is not, nor should there be, any rule that every word of a judgment is fully immune from the possibility of making a complaint to the first defendant. The claimants submit that there are two alternative analyses which they are entitled to rely upon and which support the contention that this case is arguable and provide a good reason for permission to be granted. The first alternative is that the immunity granted to judicial decisions applies only to reasons given for the decision that the court is required to make but not to any other comments unrelated to the reasons for the decision. The second alternative is that the contents of a judgment will rarely amount to misconduct, but they could do in an extreme case, for example if the judge was motivated by a dishonest ulterior motive. The claimant submits that permission could only be refused on this ground if every word of  a judgment is fully immune under the legislation.
Ground 2 is the contention that what are submitted to have been prejudicial comments about matters which were at the time sub judice and before Peel J were capable of amounting to misconduct and ought to have been investigated by the first defendant. The claimant submits that even if the observations could not be pursued as a contempt of court, and were protected by judicial immunity, the observations were not exempt from consideration as misconduct, and the first defendant’s failure to consider them as such was an error of law.
In a similar fashion it is submitted that the first defendant erred in law in concluding that the complaints related to the insinuation of impropriety by both Indi’s parents and their lawyers was not capable of being misconduct. The allegations related to what would be recognised as breaches of the codes applying to legal professionals and therefore they should have been investigated and considered. These contentions are Ground 3 of the claim.
Ground 4 is the submission that the first defendant fell into error in failing to investigate the complaint that from reading the judgment of the first interested party it could be discerned that he had lost his temper and was exhibiting inappropriate emotions when delivering it. A failure to be courteous, tolerant and respectful is a well-established category of judicial misconduct and this complaint should have been taken forward for investigation. Finally Ground 5 is an allegation that the decision given to both the claimants failed to provide adequate reasons to explain the decision which had been reached. At best the first defendant provided formulaic or generic reasons without engaging with the need to provide reasons which clearly and intelligibly conveyed a proper explanation for why the complaints had been rejected.
Turning to the second defendant in the claimants’ Ground 6 the claimants contend that the second defendant failed to exercise its statutory duty to review their case, in circumstances where the basis of the application to the second defendant was that by refusing to accept their complaints under the 2023 Rules and the 2023 Regulations the first defendant had failed to comply with prescribed procedures. This was a paradigm example of the kind of failure of process that the second defendant ought to have properly reviewed.
The first defendant submits in response that it was entitled to conclude that, firstly, the claimants’ complaint did not comply with the guidance in relation to the necessary details to be provided to support a complaint of misconduct and, secondly, that the complaint was plainly about a judicial decision and not within their statutory remit. There are clear and appropriate limits on the scope of the first defendant’s jurisdiction which correctly exclude any complaint about a judicial decision in a ruling or in the course of case management.
It is submitted that when the claimant’s complaints are analysed they are a grievance in relation to the content of the first interested party’s judgment, or what was said in it. That could not properly be the subject of a complaint since it is in respect of a judicial decision or the exercise of case management powers. The first defendant draws attention to the importance of preserving the independence of the judiciary and the chilling effect on that independence if it were thought that the content of judgments could be the subject of complaints. Further, it is inappropriate for the first defendant’s jurisdiction to be exercised following the dissection of the judgment into those aspects which are the ratio and those which are obiter dicta in the manner implied by some of the claimants’ submissions. The ambit of misconduct in the first defendant’s jurisdiction is narrow and necessarily so since the judiciary are office holders and have a very different role to people who are members of other regulated professions.
The second defendant submits in response to Ground 6 that the statutory remit established by section 110 of the 2005 Act is clear and does not involve any enquiry into the merits of the first defendant’s decision at all. The conclusion which the second defendant reached, that the process followed by the first defendant was fair and appropriate, was unimpeachable.
Conclusions
It is necessary at the outset of my conclusions to records my deepest sympathies for Indi’s family, who found themselves, along with their much loved baby daughter, in such devastatingly tragic and difficult circumstances. It is hard, if not impossible, for those who have not faced such a situation to imagine the impact it creates for all concerned, in particular the family.
I note for the purposes of record that at the outset of proceedings a point was taken in relation whether or not the first defendant has been correctly served with proceedings. This point was not pursued, or certainly not pursued with any great vigour, at the hearing and I do not propose to consider it further in reaching my decision on the application.
In order to evaluate the claimants’ grounds it is necessary to examine the statutory framework within which the first defendant has to exercise its jurisdiction. Sections 108 and 115 of the 2005 Act provide, firstly, the powers to impose a disciplinary measure on a judicial office holder and, secondly, the power to make regulations to govern the investigation and determination of allegations of “misconduct” by judicial office holders. Section 122 of the 2005 Act explains that the “prescribed” procedures which must be complied with before the disciplinary powers can be deployed are those made pursuant to section 115. The term “misconduct” is not defined in the 2005 Act, or the 2023 Regulations or the 2023 Rules.
In my view the term “misconduct” must be construed in the context in which it is used, namely the framework provided by the 2005 Act. It is of very limited value to seek to use how that term may have been defined in other professional disciplinary contexts: as the 2005 Act makes clear, a judge is an office holder and as such subject to specific provisions in relation to appointment and regulation. Most importantly for these purposes is the key overarching requirement for a judge’s continued independence to be guaranteed by the duties identified in section 3(1) and (6) of the 2005 Act. The need for “misconduct” to be read subject to the explicit and critical duty to safeguard judicial independence is consistent with Rule 23(c), which requires a complaint to be dismissed if it relates to “a judicial decision or judicial case management, and raises no question of misconduct”. It is clear that “misconduct” is entirely to be distinguished from judicial decisions and case management, that is to say the judge preforming a judicial role.
It is clear both from the introductory paragraph of the claimant’s complaint to the first defendant, and also the substance of each of the complaints raised, that the claimants were concerned in relation to comments and observations which were expressed by the first interested party during the course of giving judgment. At first sight, therefore, the matters complained of were part of a judicial decision and not matters about which the claimants could raise a complaint. However, the claimants’ concern is in relation to the phrase “and raises no question of misconduct”. They submit that it cannot be the case that everything said in a judicial decision is immune from potential disciplinary proceedings, and have, as set out above, posited a number of potential alternative approaches to the issue.
I am not convinced that the claimants’ analysis is the correct route to the solution of the arguments in this case. In my view it is clear, and a cardinal principle upon which the 2005 Act is built, that judicial independence must be guaranteed and safeguarded. This is a principle which has to govern the operation of the first defendant’s role in relation to the disciplinary powers contained in sections 108 and 115 of the 2005 Act. In undertaking their activities they must protect judicial independence and take account of the Lord Chancellor’s duty not only to protect judicial independence but also recognise the need  for the judiciary to have the support necessary for them to exercise their judicial functions. As noted, it is clear that this is reflected in the 2023 Rules; it is also reflected in the emphasis in the guidance provided by the first defendant online focussing on a judge’s “personal behaviour” as distinct from a decision that they have made or how they have managed a case. It is this distinction which leads to what the first defendant describes in written submissions as its limited remit.
It is important to recognise that in undertaking their judicial role a judge will often need to make findings or pass observations about the case to which they have been assigned which will be unwelcome or even offensive to parties or witnesses involved in the dispute. The judge may have to find someone to have been untruthful or guilty of deceit. The judge may have to make pointed remarks about how a case has been presented or argued; it may be regarded by the judge as necessary to express judicial displeasure about how a case has been prepared. The protection of judicial independence also safeguards the ability for a judge to express conclusions in trenchant and uncompromising terms. It may also be considered by the judge to be appropriate to pass some observations about wider issues in the context of the case before them well beyond the specific issue they are having to determine, for instance in relation to earlier applications which have been made or the behaviour of the litigants at earlier stages of the litigation. This may be required to guide the future conduct of the case, or in some cases to provide wider guidance in relation to appropriate practice. All of these activities are part of the judge undertaking their judicial duties; they are not aspects of personal behaviour, entirely divorced and distinct from a judge fulfilling their judicial role. The way in which the judge performs this judicial role is, therefore, protected by the principle of judicial independence.
Once this distinction is understood it is clear that the first defendant was correct not to accept the claimants complaints because they did not comply with Rule 8(c) since on analysis they did not contain allegations of misconduct. The complaints which were particularised all related to the first interested party’s judicial decision and the way in which, fulfilling his judicial role, he expressed the judgment which he delivered in that capacity. The comments and observations which he made during the judgment related to the case before the court and were part of a judicial decision: judges are not confined in pronouncing their decisions to the specific issue before them for the reasons set out above. Complaint 5 was, as expressed in the complaint, again related to the first interested party’s “choice of words” and a suggested inference of anger or irritation to be drawn from the way in which the judicial decision was articulated. As pointed out by the first defendant in its written submissions this complaint was unsupported by any details of any tone or manner relied upon or any times of the hearing relied upon when a recording of the hearing could be reviewed. The complaint was therefore, akin to the other complaints, related to the judicial decision and the way in which it was expressed. That was a matter excluded from the first defendant’s limited remit since the complaint related to the first interested party’s discharge of his judicial duties in making a judicial decision as distinct from personal behaviour unrelated to that role.
In considering the application of Rule 8(c) and whether a complaint should be accepted, in my view the first defendant was entitled to have regard to the contents of Rule 23(c) in determining whether the complaint contained admissible complaints of misconduct. For the reasons set out above, the complaints which the claimants made were excluded by the provisions in Rule 23(c) as amounting to misconduct within the first defendant’s jurisdiction limited as it is by ensuring the protection of judicial independence. As a result of the analysis set out above, the first defendant was bound to determine whether the complaint had been properly particularised for the purposes of Rule 8(c) by assessing whether they would be bound to dismiss it as falling into the category identified by Rule 23(c).
It follows that I have reached the conclusion that the decision of the first defendant was correct and it is not arguable that the first defendant ought to have accepted the complaint and investigated it. Having reviewed the decision issued by the first defendant I am satisfied that it adequately explained the basis for rejecting the claimants’ complaints and set out the relevant rule that the complaint failed to comply with. It appears clear from the claimants’ case that the basis of the first defendant’s rejection of their case, that the complaints fell within the exception provided for judicial decisions and case management, was understood. In reality what is sought by means of this ground is the reasons for the first defendant’s reasons and those are not required by the principles which govern the assessment of legally adequate reasons. The claimants’ case in relation to the reasons provided by the first defendant under Ground 5 is not arguable.
It follows that in the light of my conclusions in respect of the claim against the first defendant the claim against the second defendant must also fail. The second defendant was entitled to conclude, exercising the restricted jurisdiction provided by section 101 of the 2005 Act, that there had been no error in the process operated by the first defendant when declining to accept the claimants’ complaints. The claimants argue that the procedures prescribed for the first defendant required them to investigate the complaint but for the reasons which have already been set out above that was not the case. The first defendant was fully entitled to reach the conclusion that these complaints were excluded by the specific provisions in the 2023 Rules in relation to judicial decisions and case management. There was no procedural failure in the way in which the first defendant reached that conclusion and therefore the second defendant was entitled to reach the decision which was made. It is not arguable that there is an error of law in any of the decisions which are challenged in these proceedings.
When refusing permission to apply for judicial review Freedman J made a costs order in favour of the first defendant in the sum of £3,664 and in favour of the second defendant in the sum of £3,040.63, and whilst doing so permitted the claimants to make submissions if they objected to the costs order being made. The claimants took the opportunity to object to both of the costs orders which had been made, submitting that given the exceptionally tragic circumstances of the case and the genuine and serious grievances of the claimants there should be no order for costs in the case or alternatively a reduction in the costs awarded. Furthermore, it is submitted that there is no divergence between the interests of the two defendants and it was unnecessary for them to instruct separate representation. Finally, the claimants submit that the arguments which have been advanced by the first and second defendants are straightforward, and in the light of this the amount of costs which have been sought are excessive and disproportionate.
I have reviewed the schedules of costs which were submitted by each defendant and also the responses which they have provided to the claimants’ submissions. In my view, bearing in mind the extent of the papers and the nature of the issues which have been raised in this application, the hours claimed in each schedule are reasonable and the rates appropriate. It is clear that both defendants needed to be represented separately: they have separate roles to play, with the second defendant undertaking a supervisory role so far as the first defendant is concerned. I have already acknowledged the extraordinarily tragic context of this case and have no difficulty in accepting that the claimant’s motivation for bring this application was their sense of grievance in relation to the decision of the interested parties. However, neither of these features amount to a legitimate justification for reducing the costs in this case or departing from the usual principle that an unsuccessful applicant for permission to apply for judicial review should bear the costs of a defendant in providing an acknowledgment of service and summary grounds for resisting the claim. As a consequence of these conclusions I do not propose to disturb the costs order which was made by Freedman J which will remain in force.
In the light of the absence of earlier authority in which issues in relation to the scope of the first defendant’s jurisdiction and its relationship to the principle of judicial independence I give permission for this judgment to be cited.

Approved Judgment
This judgment was handed down remotely at 10.00am on 3 February 2025 by circulation to the parties or their representatives by e-mail and by release to the National Archives.
.............................
Master Clark:
This is my judgment on this Part 8 claim, which seeks directions as to the distribution of the estate of Elfed Williams (“the deceased”) who died who died on 11 June 2023, leaving a will dated 31 March 2014 (“the Will”).
The claimant, David Leslie White, is the sole executor of the Will, to whom probate of the Will was granted on 6 October 2023.  The net value of the estate is £393,974.
The defendant, Keith Elfed Williams (to whom I refer, without intending any disrespect, as “Keith”), is the deceased’s son and a beneficiary under the Will.
Clause 4 of the Will provides for two pecuniary legacies totalling £20,000.  Clauses 5 and 6 provide:
I GIVE all the residue of my estate (out of which shall be paid my funeral and  testamentary expenses and my debts) to my Trustees to hold upon the trusts and with and subject to the powers and provisions contained In this Will (and such estate and property and the property which currently represents it is referred to in this Will as “the Trust Fund"")
My Trustees shall hold the Trust Fund ON TRUST to divide it or treat it as being divided into six parts of equal value and to hold them on the following trusts and subject to the following provisions:
My Trustees shall hold those parts ON TRUST absolutely
as to one of them for LINDA ANNE PADDON of 11 Hickman Close Broxbourne Hertfordshire EN10 7TD PROVIDED THAT if she should die before me then my Trustees shall hold this part for such of her children who survive me and if more than one in equal shares
as to one of them for EDWARD ALBERT SIMMONS of 275 Elm Park Avenue Elm Park Hornchurch Essex RM12 4PG
as to one of them for HARRY FREDRICK SIMMONS I Hazel Close Noakbrldge Lalndon Basildon Essex SS15 5GT
as to one of them for my sister EIRWEN HILL 28 Whiterock Avenue Graigweh Pontypridd South Wales CF37 2EL
as to one of them for my son KEITH ELFED WILLIAMS who I last knew to live at 86 Gorseway Rush Green Romford Essex RM7 ORX PROVIDED THAT if he should die before me then my Trustees shall hold this part for such of the children of my son KEITH ELFED WILLIAMS who survive me and if more than one in equal shares
as to one of them for MARSDEN WILLIAMS Old Zion Chapel Flat 2 Trehafod Road Trehafod Pontypridd Rhondda South Wales CF37 2LY
PROVIDED also that if at any time the trusts declared by Clause 6(a) above should fail then from the time of failure that share (and any part or parts of any share which may already have accrued to it under this provision) shall accrue to the other share or shares (and equally if more than one) the trusts of which have not at that time failed and be held on the trusts and with and subject to the powers and provisions affecting such other share or shares”
Keith was estranged from the deceased during his lifetime. That estrangement extended to his effectively refusing to accept the gift to him under the Will of one sixth of the residuary estate (“Keith’s share”), the value of which is estimated to be over £60,000. Keith has no children.
Keith has repeatedly indicated to the claimant’s solicitors that he wants nothing to do with the deceased’s estate. On 13 November 2023, they sent him a Notice of Disclaimer for completion by him, but he has not provided them with a signed copy.
The claim was commenced on  22 January 2024. Keith has not filed an acknowledgement of service of the claim form, nor responded to the claim in any way.
On 29 May 2024 I made an order recording that I was satisfied that Keith had by his conduct shown an intention to disclaim his entitlement under the Will.
In these circumstances, an issue arises as to whether Keith’s share devolves:
to be shared between the 5 remaining beneficiaries under clause 6 of the Will;
on a partial intestacy between those persons entitled on intestacy (“the intestacy beneficiaries”).
This in turn depends on whether the word “failure” in clause 6(b) of the Will includes a disclaimer.  If it does, then the substitutionary gift provided for by that clause takes effect. If it does not, and the gift to Keith lapses, then it would pass to the intestacy beneficiaries.
The claimant’s enquiries have ascertained that the intestacy beneficiaries are
Lorna Davies – the only child of the deceased’s sister Frances Williams (herself deceased);
Eirwen Hill (née Williams - the deceased’s sister);
Marsden Williams (the deceased’s brother).
Two of these people are beneficiaries under clause 6 of the Will, but would take a larger share (1/3 as opposed to 1/5) if Keith’s share devolved on intestacy.
My order of 29 May 2024 included a direction that the claimant write to the intestacy beneficiaries outlining the position, and asking whether they wished to claim an entitlement to a 1/3 of Keith’s share. Perhaps not surprisingly, they each indicated that they maintained an entitlement as intestacy beneficiaries. Ms Hill expressed the view that clause 6(b) of the Will did not apply to a disclaimer as such.
In these circumstances, I directed the claimant to serve on the intestacy beneficiaries:
notice of the claim pursuant to CPR 19.13(4)(a)(i) in the prescribed form, Form CH7;
the claim form;
all evidence filed in the claim;
the order dated 29 May 2024 of Master Clark
the draft order sought
the skeleton argument filed on 20 August 2024.
statement of costs
and to file certificates of service of these documents. This was done in October 2024.  None of the intestacy beneficiaries have filed acknowledgements of service.
Legal principles
Interpretation
For present purposes, it is sufficient to refer to the general principles of interpretation of wills set out in Marley v Rawlings [2015] AC 129 at [19] - [22]. At [19] Lord Neuberger said:
“… the court is concerned to find the intention of the party or parties, and it does this by identifying the meaning of the relevant words, (a) in light of (i) the natural and ordinary meaning of those words, (ii) the overall purpose of the document, (iii) any other provisions of the document, (iv) the facts known or assumed by the parties at the time that the document was executed, and (v) common sense, but, (b) ignoring subjective evidence of any party’s intentions.”
Disclaimer
Disclaimer is a refusal to accept an interest: Re Scott, decd [1975] 1 W.L.R. 1260 at 1271.  To use the colourful words of Walton J in Re Scott: “nobody can put an estate upon another in spite of his teeth”.
As to its effect, at common law the position was, as stated in Re Scott at 1271:
“The effect of a disclaimer is not to throw the property on to the scrap heap, but to refuse to accept it in the first place, leaving the ownership with the people or the interest or the estate or whatever, from which it was derived in the first place.”
Thus, in the absence of a substitutionary clause, a disclaimed gift will pass under the rules of intestacy.
However, this position was altered by section 33A of the Wills Act 1837, introduced by amendment (Footnote: 1) by section 2 of the Estates of Deceased Persons (Forfeiture Rule and Law of Succession) Act 2011). This provides, so far as relevant:
“33A Disclaimer or forfeiture of gift
This section applies where a will contains a devise or bequest to a person who—
disclaims it, or
…
The person is, unless a contrary intention appears by the will, to be treated for the purposes of this Act as having died immediately before the testator.”
(emphasis added)
A corresponding amendment was made the rules governing succession on intestacy in the Administration of Estates Act 1925, by inserting as section 46A (again, so far as relevant):
“46A Disclaimer or forfeiture on intestacy
This section applies where a person—
is entitled in accordance with section 46 to an interest in the residuary estate of an intestate but disclaims it, or
…
The person is to be treated for the purposes of this Part as having died immediately before the intestate.”
These amendments were made in implementation of Law Commission Report (No. 295, July 2005) entitled “The Forfeiture Rule and the Law of Succession”.  The Commission had been asked to review the relationship between the forfeiture and intestacy rules with reference to the difficulties highlighted in the case of Re DWS (deceased) [2001] Ch 568 (CA).
In DWS, a son killed both his parents, neither of whom had left a will. The forfeiture rule excluded him from inheriting. However, the Court of Appeal decided that the rule operated to exclude not only him, but also his son, from inheriting. The inheritance went instead to the couple’s more distant relatives entitled on intestacy.
In its Report, the Law Commission recommended that:
there should be a statutory rule that, where a person forfeits the right to inherit from an intestate through having killed them, the rules of intestate succession, as laid down in sections 46 and 47 of the Administration of Estates Act 1925 (as amended), should be applied as if the killer had died immediately before the intestate (para 3.33 of the Report); and
Where a person forfeits a benefit under a will through having killed the testator, the will should be applied as if the killer had died immediately before the testator, unless the will contains a provision to the contrary (para. 4.11).
This principle was extended to disclaimer, so that the Commission recommended that where a person disclaims an inheritance, either under a will or under the law of intestacy, the inheritance should devolve as if the person disclaiming had died immediately before the deceased (para 4.28 of the Report).
The wording of section 33A, which was enacted in the same form as in the draft Bill annexed to the Report was, as the notes to the draft Bill show, intended to achieve that result.
The editors of Williams at 9-17 (Footnote: 2) consider, however, that this provision is limited to providing that, for the purposes of section 33 of the Wills Act 1837, the disclaiming person is treated as having predeceased the testator. It does not, in their view, provide that the testator's will has effect for all purposes as if the person disclaiming had predeceased the testator. They regard this as the result of either a drafting error or a misunderstanding of the scope of the Wills Act 1937.  The relevant paragraph in Willliams was referred to in Macmillan Cancer Support v Hayes [2017] EWHC 3110 (Ch), [2018] WTLR 243 in which it was suggested that the error might be susceptible to “statutory rectification”: see Inco Europe Limited v First Choice Distribution [2000] 1 WLR 586.
As to section 33 itself, it provides that (in both cases, subject to a contrary intention in the will):
if a will makes a gift to a child or remoter descendant of the testator, and that beneficiary predeceases the testator, then the gift takes effect as a gift to that beneficiary’s issue living at the testator’s death; and
if a will makes a gift to a class of persons consisting of the children or remoter descendants of the testator, and a member of that class predeceases the testator, then the gift takes effect by substituting the issue living at the testator’s death of that class member (who take between the share that their parent would have taken).
Section 33 is not concerned with, and does not alter the effect of, an express substitution clause in a will which substitutes other beneficiaries for a primary beneficiary if the latter predeceases the testator.  Accordingly, if the reference “for the purposes of this Act” is restricted to section 33, section 33A will correspondingly have no effect on such a clause.  It will also not have the general effect on disclaimers set out in the Law Commission's recommendation and intended to be given effect by the provision.
Lapse
I turn to the position if Keith is to treated as having pre-deceased the deceased.
The term “lapse” is generally applied to the failure of a testamentary gift owing to the death of the devisee or legatee in the testator's lifetime: see Williams on Wills (11th edn) para 47.1 and the cases cited at footnote 1.
A lapsed gift of a share of residue passes as on an intestacy: see Williams at para 47.6 and the cases cited at footnote 4; and Srymsher v Northcote (1818) 1 Sw 566, 570.  However, this rule does not apply if the will shows a contrary intention: Re Allan [1903] 1 Ch 276; and so, a will may be drafted to provide that, on the death of a legatee, their share passes to some substituted person or persons.
Scope of section 33A of the Wills Act 1837
For the reasons given below, it is not, in my judgment, necessary to decide whether section 33A(2) has effect for all purposes of determining the meaning and effect of a will, or, if not, whether it can properly be subjected to statutory rectification.
Analysis and conclusions
In this case, the court is concerned with two express substitutionary clauses: in clause 6(a)(v) and 6(b) of the Will.
If Keith is not to be treated as having predeceased the deceased, then his disclaimer would result in a partial intestacy in respect of his share, unless the Will otherwise provides. However, clause 6(b) provides that if the trusts in clause 6(a) fail, then the failed share accrues to the other shares.  In my judgment, the natural and ordinary meaning of the word “fails” extends to a disclaimer, notwithstanding that it does not take place at the date of death, but at a later stage.  The gift to Keith would therefore have failed, and the substitutionary provisions in clause 6(b) would apply.
If, on the other hand, Keith is to be treated as having pre-deceased the deceased, then since he had no children, then the substitutionary gift to his children also would fail, in my judgment, within the meaning of clause 6(b); so that that clause would take effect to distribute his share between the other residuary beneficiaries.
Accordingly, in my judgment, Keith’s 1/6 share of the deceased’s residuary estate falls to be divided between the other beneficiaries of the residuary estate in clause 6(a).

MRS JUSTICE HILL
Mrs Justice Hill DBE:
Introduction
The Claimants are three companies who are part of a large petrochemical group called the Valero Group. They own or have a right to possession of a series of sites in England and Wales which include oil refineries and terminals, defined for the purposes of this litigation as the “8 Sites”.
The Defendants are Persons Unknown connected with Just Stop Oil, Extinction Rebellion, Insulate Britain and Youth Climate Swarm (defined as the “4 Organisations”) who (i) trespass or stay on the 8 Sites; (ii) block access to the 8 Sites or otherwise interfere with the access to the sites by the Claimants, their servants, agents, licensees or invitees; and (iii) who have been involved in suspected tortious behaviour or whom the Claimants fear will be involved in tortious behaviour at the 8 Sites and the relevant access roads.
On 26 January 2024, Ritchie J granted the Claimants a final injunction against the Defendants to last 5 years, for the detailed reasons he gave in Valero Energy Ltd v Persons Unknown [2024] EWHC 134.
Ritchie J’s order, amended under the slip rule on 5 February 2024, made provision for the injunction to be reviewed once a year, no later than the anniversary of the 26 January 2024 order, or as close to that date as was convenient to the court.
By an application notice dated 21 November 2024, the Claimants sought a review hearing. The application was argued by the Claimants’ counsel at a hearing before me on 24 January 2025. None of the Defendants attended or were represented at the hearing.
The factual background
Ritchie J set out the factual background in detail in his judgment at [1]-[45].
In summary, between 1 and 7 April 2022 a number of environmental activists undertook direct action at the Kingsbury Terminal (one of the 8 Sites: see Ritchie J’s judgment at [4]) and on the adjoining access roads. This led to approximately 48 individuals being arrested by the Warwickshire Police at and around that site. Further protest activity took place at and around the Kingsbury Terminal between 9 and 15 April 2022, leading to around 38 arrests.
This conduct was part of a nationwide campaign. Similar direct action occurred at a number of other oil terminals and refineries as well as associated sites. These actions were combined with statements demonstrating a commitment to disrupt indefinitely the oil industry until the Defendants’ demands were met.
As a result, injunctions were granted to a number of other entities involved in the energy industry. Since these injunctions have been granted, the direct action has largely ceased. Instead, environmental activists have turned their attention to other related targets which are not protected by injunctions.
The Claimants brought this claim to avoid the potentially very serious health and safety and environmental consequences of the Defendants’ actions, as well as other serious consequences for the public. They relied on witness statements from, among others, David Blackhouse (European regional security manager for Valero International Security), David McLoughlin (a director employed by the Valero Group responsible for directing operations and logistics across all of the 8 Sites) and Emma Pinkerton (one of their solicitors). Ritchie J accepted all the evidence provided by the Claimants: see his judgment at [22], [25]-[44] and [46]-[37].
Service issues
The third witness statement of Jessica Hurle dated 29 February 2024 explained how Ritchie J’s order had been served.
In respect of the First and Second Defendants and those named Defendants for whom the Claimants did not have a postal address, the order was served by the Claimants using the alternative methods set out in the order. In respect of those named Defendants for whom the Claimants did have a postal address, the order was served pursuant to the usual methods set out in CPR Part 6.
The First and Second Defendants were deemed served on 15 February 2024. Those named Defendants in respect of whom the Claimants did not have a postal address were deemed served on 9 February 2024. Those named Defendants in respect of whom the Claimants did have a postal address were served between 10 and 14 February 2024.
The sixth witness statement of Anthea Adair dated 15 January 2025 described how the documents relating to the review application (namely the application notice and supporting evidence and the hearing notice, together with a cover letter confirming where various documents could be found) were served.
In respect of the First and Second Defendants and those named Defendants for whom the Claimants did not have a postal address, these documents were served by the Claimants using the alternative methods set out in the order of Master Cook dated 7 June 2023. In respect of those named Defendants for whom the Claimants did have a postal address, they were served pursuant to the usual methods set out in CPR Part 6.
The First and Second Defendants were deemed served on 9 January 2025. Those named Defendants in respect of whom the Claimants did not have a postal address were deemed served on 7 January 2025. Those named Defendants in respect of whom the Claimants did have a postal address were served between 3 and 9 January 2025.
Ritchie J ordered that the hearing bundle for a review hearing must be served not less than 7 days before the review hearing. The order of Master Eastman sealed on 1 December 2023 provided alternative methods for serving the hearing bundles.
The hearing bundle for this review hearing was served and filed on 16 January 2025. There was a question mark over whether it had, in fact, been filed 2 minutes late. Out of an abundance of caution the Claimants filed an application for relief from sanctions dated 22 January 2025. This was supported by the seventh witness statement of Anthea Adair of the same date.
For the reasons given in an ex tempore judgment at the start of the hearing, to the extent that the Claimants required relief from sanctions I granted it. I did so, in summary, because, applying the well-known test in Denton and ors v TH White Ltd and ors [2014] EWCA Civ 906, [2014] WLR 3926 at [40], this was neither a serious nor significant failure; it occurred due to some technical issues with the uploading process due to the size of the bundle; and it had not caused any prejudice to the Defendants or impacted on the litigation.
The legal framework
In Wolverhampton City Council and others v London Gypsies and Travellers and others [2024] 2 WLR 45 at [225] the Supreme Court observed that review hearings of this kind:
“…will give all parties an opportunity to make full and complete disclosure to the court, supported by appropriate evidence, as to how effective the order has been: whether any reasons or grounds for its discharge have emerged; whether there is any proper justification for continuance; and whether and on what a basis a further order ought to be made.”
In HS2 v Persons Unknown [2024] EWHC 1277 (KB), Ritchie J considered how the Court should approach its task at such a hearing:
Drawing these authorities together, on a review of an interim injunction against PUs [Persons Unknown] and named Defendants, this Court is not starting de novo. The Judges who have previously made the interim injunctions have made findings justifying the interim injunctions. It is not the task of the Court on review to query or undermine those. However, it is vital to understand why they were made, to read and assimilate the findings, to understand the sub-strata of the quia timet, the reasons for the fear of unlawful direct action. Then it is necessary to determine, on the evidence, whether anything material has changed. If nothing material has changed, if the risk still exists as before and the claimant remains rightly and justifiably fearful of unlawful attacks, the extension may be granted so long as procedural and legal rigour has been observed and fulfilled.
On the other hand, if material matters have changed, the Court is required to analyse the changes, based on the evidence before it, and in the full light of the past decisions, to determine anew, whether the scope, details and need for the full interim injunction should be altered. To do so, the original thresholds for granting the interim injunction still apply.”
In Arla Foods v Persons Unknown [2024] EWHC 1952 at [128], Jonathan Hilliard KC (sitting as a Deputy Judge of the High Court) described the annual review process as:
“…allow[ing] a continued assessment of whether circumstances have changed so as make the continuation of the injunction appropriate.”
Earlier this year, in Transport for London v Persons Unknown and Others [2025] EWHC 55 (KB) (“TfL”) at [54]-[57], Morris J took a similar approach. At [55], he observed that:
“TfL has already provided detailed evidence at a full trial and the Court has, on two occasions, already made a full determination of the issue of risk and the balance of interests. In my judgment, in those circumstances there needed to be some material change in order to justify a conclusion that the Final Injunctions should not continue.”
The evidence, submissions and decision
In support of the application the Claimants relied on the evidence filed to date, set out in some detail in Ritchie J’s judgment, as well as updating evidence in the form of the sixth witness statement of Mr Blackhouse dated 20 November 2024 (“DB6”) and the sixth witness statement of Ms Pinkerton dated 19 November 2024 (“EP6”).
Ritchie J made the following finding as to the level of risk on the basis of the evidence available to him on 26 January 2024:
In my judgment the evidence shows that the Claimants have a good cause of action and fully justified fears that they face a high risk and an imminent threat that the remaining 17 named Defendants (who would not give undertakings) and/or that UPs [Unknown Persons] will commit the pleaded torts of trespass and nuisance at the 8 Sites in connection with the 4 Organisations”.
He went on to find that the Defendants did not have a realistic defence to the claim; that the balance of convenience and justice weighed in favour of granting the final injunction to the Claimants; and that damages would not be an adequate remedy for the Claimants: [65]-[70].
He was also satisfied that the various procedural requirements set out in the case law were satisfied by the injunction proposed: [71]-[78].
I take these findings as my starting point, in accordance with the legal framework summarised above.
The updating evidence served in support of the review application, which I accept, makes clear that there exists a continued threat of trespass and nuisance at the 8 Sites.
Mr Blackhouse provided further evidence of the continuing threat, vulnerability and risks, in particular at paragraphs 4.1-5.4 of DB6. For example, he referred to the fact that from his regular meetings with the police and local resilience forums in the areas where the Claimants have assets, his understanding is that the threat remains the same. He also referred to information received from the National Police Coordination Centre to the effect that the threat level remains the same.
As Ms Pinkerton explained in paragraphs 5.1-5.7 of EP6, none of the Defendants have contacted the Claimants to say that they no longer intend to carry out direct action at the Sites. There have also been many instances of direct action by environmental activists, notably Just Stop Oil and Extinction Rebellion, across the country in relation to the energy industry. This included a nationwide campaign planned and orchestrated by Just Stop Oil to carry out direct action at airports in the summer of 2024. Statements have continued to be made about the need for direct action and related conduct in respect of fossil fuel extraction and production.
Ms Pinkerton highlighted that courts have continued to grant or renew injunctions on the basis of the same continuing threat: see, for example, Shell v Persons Unknown [2024] EWHC 3130 (KB) at [101]-[113], where on 5 December 2024 Dexter Dias J held that that there remained a real and imminent risk of direct action by the named Defendants and Persons Unknown in relation to Shell’s Haven oil refinery and other sites.
In light of this evidence, I accept the Claimants’ submission that nothing material has changed in the evidence since Ritchie J made his order. In particular, as explained above, there remains a continued threat of direct action at the 8 Sites. This is supported by the fact that, as far as the Claimants are aware, no injunction originally granted to an energy company as a result of the direct action in April 2022 has been discharged on the basis of a finding that the level of threat has diminished
The evidence suggests that direct action at the 8 Sites has diminished. However the courts have repeatedly held in this context that evidence of this kind is not evidence that the threat has dissipated; rather, it is evidence that the injunctions have had their intended effect: see, for example, Ritchie J’s judgment in this case at [64] and Shell at [111]-[112].
There has been no material change in the case law since Ritchie J’s judgment.
As to new legislation, Ritchie J considered the new offences in the Public Order Act 2023 before making the order: see his judgment at [66]. In any event, courts have repeatedly accepted that these offences do not materially alter the position or serve to diminish the threat of continued action: see, for example, Drax Power Ltd v Persons Unknown [2024] EWHC 2224 (KB), at [24] and [28] (Ritchie J); North Warwickshire Borough Council v Persons Unknown [2024] EWHC 2254 (KB) at [88] (HHJ Emma Kelly, sitting as a Judge of the High Court); and TfL at [37]-[38] and [58]–[67] (Morris J).
In accordance with her duty of disclosure Ms Holland KC drew my attention to the fact that in Shell, Dexter Dias J observed that the new legislation is a “material change”. However, he went on to hold that it remains “evidentially unclear what material impact it has on deterring future protest and to what extent it operates on the minds of those who would protest against Shell”; and that the mere existence of the new offences in and of themselves could not affect the analysis on risk of continued threat: [132] and [140].
Conclusion
I have reviewed and used as my starting point the findings Ritchie J made and the evidence that was before him, as he made “a full determination of the issue of risk and the balance of interests” (TfL at [55]).
Having considered the updating evidence and more recent legal developments, I am satisfied that nothing material has changed. The risk still exists as before and the Claimants remain rightly and justifiably fearful of unlawful attacks. Procedural and legal rigour has been “observed and fulfilled” (HS2 at [32]).
For all these reasons, I approve the draft order sought by the Claimants. Ritchie J’s order will remain in effect, to be reviewed again in one year.

Defendants
Hugh Rimmer (instructed by Devonshires Claims) for the Claimant
The First Defendant appeared in person (with the assistance at times of a McKenzie Friend)

Hearing dates: 13 – 17 May & written submissions concluding 18 June 2024
Draft judgment circulated: 16 December 2024
Approved judgment
HIS HONOUR JUDGE SIMON:
The Claimant, Mrs Caroline Bailey, seeks to recover damages for dental treatment said to have been carried out negligently by the First Defendant, Dr Monica Bijlani at appointments in May 2018.  The First Defendant ran a dental practice called Brilliant Dental Limited (BDL), trading as Dr Monica’s Dental Clinic, in central London.
The Second Defendant, MBNA Ltd, is the card issuer for the credit card with which the Claimant paid for the treatment.  The Claimant alleges that the Second Defendant is jointly and severally liable, under section 75 Consumer Credit Act 1974, for any breaches of contract in relation to the dental care provided by BDL and carried out by the First Defendant.
Preliminary matters
There was a number of preliminary applications that required determination at the beginning of the trial, most notably D1’s application to adjourn the trial to allow her to obtain expert evidence.  In brief, D1 explained that she had engaged solicitors following the setting aside of default judgment and they had been on record until the end of February this year.  Those solicitors were no longer acting and the First Defendant faced conducting this trial on her own, if there were no adjournment.  If the Court were not to adjourn the trial, the First Defendant applied to delay the start until the following day to allow a Mackenzie Friend, with whom she had consulted in advance of the trial and who had already provided some assistance.  The Mackenzie Friend was unable to attend on the first day of trial.  Both the Claimant and the Second Defendant opposed the application to adjourn the trial to another date, but were more neutral on the short delay to the following morning to allow the Mackenzie Friend to be at court.
For the reasons I gave in detail at the time, I refused the application to adjourn the trial to another date.  I did, however, conclude that in the circumstances it was in the interests of justice to delay the start of the evidence until the following morning.
An application was made by the Claimant to amend the Claim Form by increasing the value to limited to £120,000.  The figure had been £80,000 on issue, but the Schedule of Loss exceeded this figure and account needed to be taken of the claim for general damages.  Permission had been granted at the CCMC on 28 February 2023 to increase the value, but the amended Claim Form was not in fact filed in accordance with the order.  A further application for permission was filed, following receipt of Professor Harding’s report.  In the circumstances, I granted the amendment.
A late application was made by the Second Defendant to clarify the legal basis upon which they would be able to recover any damages should they be awarded against the First Defendant.  Having heard from the Second Defendant (and considered the skeleton submitted in support) and from the First Defendant, I granted the application for the reasons I gave in detail at the time.
On Day Three of the trial, the Mackenzie Friend, Henry Hendron, and the First Defendant applied to the Court for Mr Hendron to be permitted to act in the capacity of representative for the First Defendant and address the Court.  The Court considered the Guidance on Mackenzie Friends.  In particular in this case, the Court took account of the fact that Mr Hendron was at the time suspended from practice as a barrister and permitting him to address the Court and question witnesses risked seriously undermining the regulatory decision in force at the time.  For the reasons I gave in detail at the time, I refused the application for Mr Hendron to address the Court.  He remained as Mackenzie Friend, assisting the First Defendant in her questioning of witnesses and in the presentation of her case.
On Day Four of the trial (Thursday 16 May), an application was made to vary the Trial Phase of  the Claimant’s budget to cover the extra days that the expert witnesses were present at court.  This was necessary, on the Claimant’s submissions, because the evidence stage extended longer into the trial than had been budgeted for.  Mr Rimmer submitted that the Hearing Notice had stated a 10.30am start on Day 1, the afternoon of that day had been lost for reasons connected with the applications by the First Defendant for an adjournment and, upon refusal, for the court to await the attendance of her Mackenzie Friend.  Other events in the trial had meant that the experts had to be present at Court on Days Three and Four.  The Court took account of the chronology of the trial, which did involve a number of delays to the progress of the trial, such as: deferring the start of the evidence to Day Two, to allow the First Defendant to prepare when her adjournment application was unsuccessful; additional time for the First Defendant to consult with her Mackenzie Friend following the conclusion of her oral evidence; and the determination of the Mackenzie Friend application itself.  The Court was mindful, however, that the parties had all been informed the week before trial that the start time would be 2pm on Day One to allow for some judicial reading.  Time was also taken up with determining the Second Defendant’s late application, referred to in paragraph 6 above.  In all the circumstances, the Court concluded that an extra £5500 should be added to the Claimant’s budget in respect of expert’s trial attendance fees.
The evidence had concluded by Thursday 16 and the Court adjourned to Friday 17 May for closing submissions.  When the Court reconvened, the First Defendant explained that Mr Hendron had promised to provide her overnight with a document that she could read to the Court as her closing submissions.  She had been reliant on that document being provided in good time for the start of the hearing.  It did not materialise and her enquiries of Mr Hendron revealed that he had suffered some form of crisis or difficulty that had prevented him from meeting the agreed arrangement in relation to submissions.  The First Defendant understandably felt disadvantaged by being let down in this way at the last minute.  Having heard submissions from the other parties, I concluded that the only fair way in which to proceed was to give directions by way of a timetable for the service of written closing submissions in the order in which they would have been delivered in Court.
The First Defendant’s written submissions extended to 90 pages and included documents which had not previously been in evidence nor been put to the experts.  Having been submitted in this way, the Claimant in closing submissions has responded by highlighting the way in which some of the documents undermine the First Defendant’s case.  Making allowances for a litigant in person does not extend to allowing the introduction of new evidence within written submissions, even if other parties have had the opportunity to comment on them.  The trial hearing was the time for consideration of all relevant evidence properly before the Court in accordance with the CPR.  I have noted, though I have not read beyond the beginning of some of the documents, that there may be documents arguably subject to legal privilege.  In all the circumstances, I have limited myself to reaching conclusions based on the evidence presented at trial and the submissions of the parties on that evidence and that evidence alone.  For clarity, the evidence presented at trial does not include documents that the First Defendant produced and sought to rely on from dental practitioners who had not seen the papers in the case or if they had, had not provided any opinion in compliance with the CPR.  There was permission for the service of expert evidence on the part of the Defendants.  Neither served such evidence and they did not therefore present any expert evidence to counter that relied on by the Claimant.  Both Defendants had the opportunity to cross-examine the Claimants’ experts and my assessment of the expert evidence is set out below.
It was in evidence at trial that the First Defendant was the subject of professional regulatory proceedings.  I have not found it necessary to determine the arguments as to admissibility of the documents disclosed from those proceedings into the claim.  I reiterate that I have reached all of my conclusions based solely on the evidence called and challenged at trial and the submissions thereon.
The claim
Throughout the trial the issues of breach of duty, causation and quantum remained in dispute.  The Second Defendant sought to put the Claimant to proof on all matters, including whether or not the Claimant had contracted directly with the First Defendant
Before addressing the evidence, it is important for the sake of clarity and consistency, to set out the nomenclature to be used for the teeth that are central to this claim, because they are referred to variously by different witnesses and in different documents.  The complication arises due to the fact that the Claimant only had one (false) tooth where two teeth would normally be.  Those two teeth would be LL1 (lower left quadrant 1) and LR1 (lower right quadrant 1).  These are the teeth at the midline, that is the central teeth, in the lower jaw.  The teeth either side of the space are therefore LL2 and LR2.
As will become clear from the evidence section below, the claim arises from the removal of a longstanding bridge that the Claimant had in place of LL1 and LR1 and its attempted replacement with an implant.  Both procedures are alleged to have been conducted negligently, in summary, because the First Defendant:
Failed to keep adequate/comprehensive records;
Failed fully to assess and plan the treatment, including failure to carry out appropriate pre-operative scans;
Failed adequately to advise about the risks and benefits of the intended treatment and of any alternatives and thereby to obtain informed consent;
Failed to identify and advise the Claimant that an implant was an inappropriate treatment, given the inadequacy of space/bone and the implant site and/or that an implant risked damage to the adjacent teeth;
Placed the implant post in such a way that it invaded the root of the adjacent left tooth (LL2), causing sufficient damage that it required extraction;
Caused such damage to the adjacent right tooth (LR2) that it had to be extracted, whether through inadequate root treatment and/or infection arising as a consequence of the negligent treatment.
As a result of the alleged negligent treatment, the Claimant suffered:
Considerable physical pain;
Surgical removal of the implant, bone loss in her jaw and the loss of the two adjacent teeth (LL2 & LR2);
Considerable past remedial dental consultations and treatment and a need for future remedial treatment;
Ischaemic colitis as a result of the medication that the Claimant took to control her dental pain, which has developed into consequential persistent dietary intolerances.
Evidence - introduction
There was live factual evidence from the Claimant, her husband and daughter, and from the First Defendant.  Professor Harding, dental expert, and Dr Leigh, gastroenterologist, also gave evidence.  It was clear from the written submissions of the parties that their notes of the oral evidence of witnesses did not always coincide.  I have set out the evidence in the case below, drawing on the written evidence and my notes of the oral evidence.  I have not provided a full transcript of either, but rather sought to include the central evidence.  The breadth of disputed issues among the parties has meant that the resume of evidence is quite lengthy.  Despite this, if I have not recorded a specific exchange from the trial it does not mean that I have not taken it into account.
The following points of evidence are either not in dispute or were clarified during the course of the oral evidence:
The Claimant had had a three-tooth bridge in place at the front of her lower jaw for many years;
The bridge had been fitted by the placement of crowns on the two teeth either side of the gap at the front of the Claimant’s mouth and then having a single false tooth in the middle of the others, the gap not being wide enough for two teeth that ought to have been there;
The Claimant attended the First Defendant’s practice in May 2016 with a discount voucher for the purpose of obtaining veneers on certain teeth (the 2016 procedure);
The First Defendant undertook a panoramic scan of the Claimant’s mouth at this appointment;
The 2016 procedure to attach the veneers proceeded without incident;
The Claimant was satisfied with the First Defendant’s work in the 2016 procedure, which was the catalyst for her returning on 26 May 2018, albeit with another discount voucher;
The dental treatment to be completed following the Claimant’s return to the First Defendant’s practice in May 2018 was removal of the bridge to be replaced with an implant (the 2018 procedure);
It was agreed at the 2018 appointment that four further veneers would be carried out;
The First Defendant did not undertake a panoramic scan of the Claimant’s mouth at the 2018 appointment;
During the 2018 appointment, the First Defendant did not discuss the advantages and disadvantages of the proposed course of treatment (the Claimant and First Defendant differ on the reasons for this);
The Claimant paid for the 2018 treatment in advance of it and in full by using her credit card, issued by the Second Defendant;
The original plan had been for the Claimant to return the following day for the implant procedure to be completed;
The procedure to remove the bridge took longer than anticipated and therefore the plan was changed so that the Claimant would return on 30 May 2018;
When the Claimant returned on 30 May 2018, no x-rays were undertaken, but the procedure began with the injection of an anaesthetic, followed by drilling for the implant;
The anaesthetic was topped up more than once during the procedure;
The Claimant was exhibiting pain and distress that did not appear to be controlled adequately by the anaesthesia and she was moving around, unable to maintain a settled position in the chair.
Claimant’s evidence
The Claimant’s evidence addressed her recollection of the appointments she attended with the First Defendant both in 2016 and then in May 2018.  There were some areas of dispute, for example, it was put to the Claimant that detailed discussions had occurred with the First Defendant in 2016 about bridge removal and the implant, including “pros, cons, complications”.
The Claimant reiterated her evidence that the recommendation of her NHS dentist to have the bridge removed only came about in 2017 or 2018.  This was due to its age and hygiene difficulties.  She did not recall discussing removal of the bridge and the implant prior to the 2018 appointment, but the Claimant could not say it did not happen.  The entry in the clinical records about price would have been for something for the future.  She had been satisfied with the First Defendant’s treatment in 2016, otherwise she would not have come back.
The Claimant’s evidence described in detail her best recollection of the 2018 appointment, procedure and its aftermath.  She described the absence of any x-rays being taken, there being no discussion about treatment alternatives or their advantages or disadvantages and the course of difficulties experienced by the First Defendant in removing the bridge, including certain language used by the First Defendant during the procedure, such as a reference to the bridge being put in with “cement”.  The Claimant recalled seeing the dental assistant’s worried look as matters proceeded.  She said that removal of the bridge took between five and six hours, with one short toilet break.  Some of the equipment being used seemed to be ineffective and parts were coming off.  The Claimant recalled that her daughter, who worked locally, had to wait until nearly 7pm before the procedure was complete and that her daughter was surprised at this.  By this stage, the Claimant says that she was in tears and distress.  During the journey home, the Claimant became increasingly unwell and in pain.  The Claimant was clear that she had never been dental phobic and could say categorically that she never said she was.  She had always attended her dentist when needed.
When the Claimant returned on 30 May 2018 for the implant to be inserted, she described in detail the way in which, shortly after it began, the First Defendant’s drilling began to cause the Claimant extreme pain.  She spoke of gripping the chair and trying to raise her left hand to indicate that she was in pain, but the First Defendant reached across and pressed her arm down.  The Claimant rejected the suggestion that this was the nurse holding her hand in a reassuring way.  Despite the topping-up of the anaesthetic, the Claimant continued to be in “excruciating pain”, which was relentless and did not subside.  She said she was in agony.  She recalled the First Defendant telling her to move her tongue out of the way, but she could not feel her tongue as it was anaesthetised.  The Claimant was told that the anaesthetic had reached the maximum dose, so she was told that she would just have to put up with the pain.  The drilling lasted more than an hour and the First Defendant attempted to place the implant post into the Claimant’s mouth several times over the course of more than an hour.  The Claimant noticed the state of the dental nurse, Maria, who looked quite worried or distressed.  Once the post was in place, the Claimant repeated that she was in pain, but was advised to take painkillers and rest.  A temporary tooth to cover the post was proposed whilst awaiting the permanent tooth to go on the post.  Neither could be ready immediately, and the Claimant left the appointment with the post exposed, but due to return a few weeks later.  The Claimant was categoric that there was no post-operative OPG during this appointment because of the pain, but there was an x-ray after the implant – not before – and the implant was said to be a little close to the adjacent tooth.
The Claimant remained in “unbearable pain” and could not sleep.  She tried to get an emergency appointment during the night, but the earliest she could get was 8am on 31 May 2018, which turned out to be with her usual dentist.  The dentist diagnosed a bad infection, prescribed antibiotics and painkillers and instructed the Claimant to return to the First Defendant as the post needed to be removed.  He was not equipped to perform this procedure.  Upon contacting the First Defendant, the Claimant was told that discomfort was normal but that she should come anyway.  The Claimant had to travel to the clinic by taxi.  The First Defendant was dismissive of the diagnosis by the other dentist and that there was no infection, but rather signs of healing.  The Claimant recalled the First Defendant saying her dentist was “an idiot” for thinking it was an infection.  The Claimant said that the clinical notes suggesting she refused removal of the post are simply not true.  Rather, the First Defendant said this was not the cause of the pain, removal was futile and it would only have to be reinserted.  On her advice, the Claimant agreed not to have the post removed, although this was an option presented.  The First Defendant then suggested two options, being monitoring of the implant or root canal treatment (RCT) to the two neighbouring teeth.  The First Defendant recommended the latter option.  The Claimant was clear that the dental notes suggesting three very different options were untrue.
The pain of the RCT was not subdued by the anaesthetic and the Claimant said so several times.  She described the First Defendant becoming agitated and said things about not having had a patient like this for over 25 years.  The Claimant stated that the procedure lasted about two hours “and was one of the most horrendous, painful and traumatising experiences” of her life.  Due to the pain, the First Defendant said she would not complete the procedures, which left them unfinished.  An x-ray was taken, the First Defendant indicating that she wishes to check the placement of the implant given the Claimant’s pain.  The First Defendant prescribed painkillers and another antibiotic in addition to that which the Claimant was already taking.  When asked why she prescribed antibiotics if there was no infection, the First Defendant replied that it was “just in case” and that she would have prescribed them in any event.  An appointment to complete the root-canal treatment was arranged for 4 June 2018.  There was no charge for this appointment (or subsequent appointments) and no advice as to what to do in the interim.
The Claimant instead booked an emergency appointment at another dentist, being hesitant to return to the First Defendant given her recent experience.  This dentist could not obtain an x-ray due to the pain the Claimant was in.  The dentist was concerned about the amount of swelling and the infection.  He extended the course of one of the antibiotics and added another (the previous additional one having been completed).  The Claimant saw her General Practitioner, who prescribed stronger painkillers.  On 7 June 2018, the Claimant attended a further emergency appointment at the Cambridge Dental Hub.  As a result of tests and examination, she was referred urgently to Addenbrookes Hospital as the implant had been drilled into the adjacent tooth.  The hospital prescribed Oramorph but could not drain the infection due to the level of pain, so the Claimant was asked to come back the following day.  An appointment with a maxillofacial consultant on 8 June 2018 led to surgery on 11 June 2018 to remove the implant and the damaged tooth.
On 7 June 2018 the First Defendant sent a text to the Claimant asking how she was and to call her as she was concerned.  The Claimant replied with details of the pain and infection and requested the model and implant number for the post used.  There was no further communication from the Claimant, despite receiving messages from the First Defendant.  On 8 June 2018, the Claimant remained in significant pain and was taking a number of painkillers, in addition to the antibiotics.  The medication was adjusted to try to control the pain.  On 9 June 2018, the Claimant awoke in the middle of the night with extreme pain in her abdomen, pelvis and lower back.  She was experiencing rectal bleeding, sweating and vomiting.  She went to Accident and Emergency.  She was very weak.  She underwent an x-ray and a CT scan, the latter revealing ischaemic colitis and necrosis in her intestine.  The Claimant was admitted to hospital, where she remained for ten days.  Attempts to treat the colitis were successful, although the alternative involving significant surgery was only narrowly avoided.  Following discharge, the Claimant required care and assistance from her husband and daughter in relation to all tasks, personal and household.  This lasted for two to three weeks.  The inability to tolerate NSAI medications meant that the Claimant had to take copious amounts of antibiotics which caused unpleasant side effects.  Colitis-related issues continued, although they are now well-controlled by diet and the Claimant can still have flare-ups.  The Claimant explained about her earlier abdominal pain episode and what she told Dr Leigh about it.  There was no obvious connection to colitis.
On 17 July 2018, the implant post and LL2 were removed.  On 17 August 2018, LR2 was removed due to heightened sensitivity caused by the incomplete root canal treatment.  The Claimant was left with a very large gap at the front of her mouth.  In the subsequent months, the Claimant received advice and significant remedial treatment.  The precise details were contained in the Claimant’s statement.  The statement also addressed the consequences of having developed colitis in terms of food intolerances that have required significant changes to diet.  Bowel problems, which developed only after the onset of colitis, have continued.  The statement referred to other health issues by way of context.  The Claimant’s statement also described her work and the plans to move to Cambridge in October 2018 and seek work locally.  The experiences around the dental treatment detrimentally affected the Claimant’s ability to seek work, especially due to her appearance and she was finding it difficult to speak and pronounce words.  A pre-booked holiday in the summer of 2018 had to be cancelled.  She had not experienced difficulties with pain management in subsequent treatments and procedures.
Mr Jim Bailey, the Claimant’s husband, adopted his statement and gave evidence that his wife had been generally in good health and although she had attended the general practitioner for various reasons, there had been nothing that required ten days’ hospitalisation.  Very shortly after his return from America, which is where he was when the Claimant was being treated by the First Defendant, she was admitted to Addenbrookes.  He became her carer in a sense after discharge.  The Claimant’s daughter, Holly Bailey, also gave brief evidence, having adopted her statement.
First Defendant’s evidence
The First Defendant qualified as a dentist in the early 1990s, subsequently training in oral and maxillofacial surgery and then completing a three-year post-doctoral programme in implant dentistry.  Her statement detailed her various qualifications and awards.  The First Defendant is the sole director of Brilliant Dental Limited (BDL) trading as Dr Monica’s Dental Clinic, and by which she was employed.  She only gets a percentage of fees paid to BDL, by way of dividend or salary.  She has had a special interest in dental implants and cosmetic dentistry and has been carrying out such treatments since 1998.  She has used the 3D CEREC method of producing 3D scanned, designed and milled/printed veneers, crowns and restorations.  She referred to having surgically placed and restored several thousand implants, and even more veneers and crowns.
The First Defendant described the 2016 appointment with the Claimant.  Although the general dental notes for that appointment are not dated they were done on 25 May 2016.  She insisted that there was discussion about the bridge and an implant.  Notes in green pen were done at the same time – this is something the First Defendant said she had been doing for years, to make the writing stand out.  She did not note the discussions about the bridge and the implant in 2016 because that was not a procedure that the Claimant had come for.  The bridge was just chatted about but not so formally, but implant procedure planning was done at the 2016 appointment.  The First Defendant’s evidence was that the decision to replace the bridge with an implant was made in 2016, to be done on the next occasion, even though sometimes she might never see the patient again.
As to the appointment on 25 May 2018, the First Defendant said that she checked the medical history as it had been two years since the previous visit.  The Claimant wished the removal of the bridge and replacement with an implant as well as a number of crowns.  The First Defendant said that the options, with associated risks and benefits, were made known to the Claimant.  As the Claimant wished to proceed with CEREC veneers and crowns, the First Defendant drew up a treatment plan and quote for removal of the bridge and replacement with two crowns and an implant.  The First Defendant read out the contents of the consent form, which she eventually accepted was a generic consent form for implantology, receiving express verbal consent.  A paper copy of the consent form was handed to the Claimant, which she signed and dated.  The First Defendant denied that she failed to obtain informed consent.  The First Defendant described the analgesia and the work done to prepare veneers/crowns.
The First Defendant said she conducted her usual diagnostic assessment and pre-treatment investigations, including an eight-point ridge/bone mapping as an alternative to a CBCT scan, as this was a single implant placement in the anterior mandible.  She said that bone-mapping in the way she described is a recognised and accepted alternative, allowing her to be satisfied with the integrity of the sectional bone profile.  Relying on her 25-years of experience, the First Defendant concluded that a 3D CBCT scan was not required and it would have exposed the Claimant to additional radiation and cost.  In oral evidence, she said she did recommend a CBCT scan, and gave the Claimant the option of having it done close by.  It was asserted that the Claimant said she trusted the First Defendant’s advice and accepted “the added risk as she did not like x-rays”.  In hindsight, the First Defendant recognised that perhaps she should have insisted on the sectional CT tomogram and generated a rigid 3D surgical template based on the scan.  Her statement said that “this would probably have prevented the slight angulation error of the implant”.
Again in oral evidence, the First Defendant said that the 2016 clinical examination and treatment plan were enough to go ahead with the procedure, because of her experience in dental implants and x-rays showed adequate bone.  An OPG was ample for a simple case like this.  She could have taken a PA radiograph, but she “did not see the need”.  A 3D scan was not required as this was not a difficult site and there was excellent access.  She said she could feel with her hands that there was no concern about bone width.  The First Defendant described the bone mapping she undertook, which was not measuring, but feeling the whole bone profile.  She did not record the results of the bone mapping as she would only do this if there was something untoward.  The fact that is it not recorded means that it was done and she was happy with it.  The First Defendant said that she could not recall specifically advising the Claimant that the implant procedure could damage adjacent teeth.  Asked whether she advised of the risk of the implant being likely to fail, the First Defendant responded that “anything in dentistry can fail”.  She said that she definitely conducted a periodontal examination in 2018, but it was not documented in the clinical notes.  She recalled that the readings were two or below, compared with the readings recorded in her 2016 periodontal examination, as there had been improvement in oral hygiene.  The possibility of RCT was also not documented, but would have been advised about.  The performance of vitality tests was also not documented.  The First Defendant was not saying that her planning was gold standard, but it was adequate with her experience.  Although the plan had been to insert the implant at the same appointment, the Claimant “looked tired” after the bridge-removal procedure and it was agreed to complete the implant the following week.
At the appointment on 30 May 2018, the First Defendant said she reassessed the Claimant, and administered prophylactic antibiotics and then anaesthetic, as documented in the records.  She repeated the detailed bone mapping assessment.  She recalled the procedure, carried out she insisted in sterile conditions, took longer than usual as the Claimant was experiencing pain, requiring pauses to administer additional anaesthetic or to reassure her.  The First Defendant’s diary indicated that the appointment was two hours, but she did not specifically challenge the Claimant’s evidence that it was more like six hours.  Even if it was, the First Defendant described this as “not an unreasonable amount of time to complete the work”, although she appeared to accept in evidence that it was eight to ten times longer than a single implant should take.  Although ideally one required 1.5mm either side of the implant, the First Defendant said that one can actually manage with 1mm either side, so 5.7mm was adequate.  The distance between LL2 and LR2 was roughly 6mm from her measurement, although this was not documented.  Asked whether she had advised the Claimant about there only being 1mm and any greater risk, the First Defendant said “no, definitely not”, this was not something she discussed with the patient.  Nevertheless, she considered the advice given and consent obtained was adequate.
She had warned the Claimant that she may experience some discomfort.  She instructed the Claimant to raise her left hand if the pain became too severe.  She said the Claimant kept stopping her “claiming to be in excruciating pain from the outset”.  However, every time the First Defendant checked the site for numbness, there was no response from the Claimant, so she provided reassurance and continued.  The First Defendant surmised that the Claimant’s pain was perhaps “psychological” or psychosomatic and although she accepted that she could have administered more local anaesthetic, she did not think this was in the Claimant’s clinical best interests at the time.  The Claimant was given Ibuprofen and antibiotics, in addition to the medication from the emergency dentist, of which the First Defendant was aware.  She accepted “on reflection and in hindsight” that a periapical x-ray should have been taken, but the Claimant was in a lot of pain and “adamant” that she would not allow any intraoral radiograph.  She apologised for the damage to LL2, which she described as “unintentional human error” in not managing to place the implant fixture straight as planned.  In oral evidence, she said the error was not due to a lack of planning, but because the Claimant was “very mobile, non-compliant” and her moving too much was the problem.  The First Defendant was asked about stopping the procedure if the patient is not compliant, but she said she did continue although it was not ideal.  It was a very difficult procedure but not one that she felt she could not do.  The First Defendant accepted that she did not conduct a 3D CBCT scan, whilst asserting that she offered this twice to be taken in a next door office, but that it was the Claimant who declined.  She said the Claimant also refused a PA radiograph.  As to pain, all patients, she said, have discomfort after surgery.  She accepted that the implant post into the root of the neighbouring tooth would be painful.  There was no indication that implant itself failed, only that it was likely to compromise the neighbouring tooth.
In respect of the appointment on 31 May 2018, the First Defendant responded to the Claimant’s email about being told of an infection by the emergency dentist, that this was “scientifically impossible”.  She advised the Claimant to come in immediately and reorganised her diary to help ease the Claimant’s pain.  She advised the Claimant of treatment options as in the clinical records.  She again reassured the Claimant that there was no infection, which was “in any case not likely” one day after the implant procedure.  The First Defendant checked the Claimant’s pain level, which she described as demonstrating “an extremely low and exaggerated pain threshold”.  She considered that LR2 was less sensitive than LL2.  She highlighted “how easily the implant could be removed”.  She denied saying that removal of implant would be futile.  The Claimant wished to stop the pain, but, the First Defendant said, did not want the implant removed unless absolutely necessary.  Elective RCT could be used on the symptomatic teeth, removing the nerve to take away the pain.  The First Defendant stated that the Claimant opted for RCT on LL2 and monitoring of LR2.
The First Defendant denied performing any RCT on LR2, although this was one of the options presented.  She said the Claimant would not know if she was working on one or both teeth.  She accepted that the x-ray from 30 May showed no RCT on LR2, but that it was present on 4 June, but neither her notes nor her recollection was that she carried out the second RCT.  The Claimant was advised to see her GP and seek advice on pain control.  Despite recommending endodontists, the First Defendant continued the agreed treatment because “the Claimant insisted”.  The RCT was conducted in accordance with the First Defendant’s usual practice, but only stage 1 was completed, with the Claimant due to return a week later (although the First Defendant’s statement also stated that she wished to complete the treatment on the day).  The procedure was offered free of charge as a gesture of goodwill.  The Claimant was said to have been grateful when she left after the treatment.  The First Defendant apologised for the discomfort, which she had not experienced in a patient in over 25 years.  Whatever medication the First Defendant did or did not prescribe, she said she was unaware of the Claimant’s having seen four other dentists and receiving medication from each.  The First Defendant accepted that the loss of LL2 was directly related to the implant, but she had no idea why LR2 or any other tooth was lost.
Expert evidence
Dr Timothy Leigh is a Consultant Gastroenterologist and Hepatologist.  He examined the Claimant remotely and provided a report dated 19 January 2022, following a full review of dental expert reports, hospital medical notes and radiology reports.  He did not consider a physical examination necessary or he would have said so.  For the first report he did not have the general practitioner records.  He noted that, whilst in Addenbrooke’s Hospital following admission on 9/10 June 2018, ischaemic colitis secondary to the use of NSAIDs was raised as a possible diagnosis.  There was slow progress while an inpatient but, after a few days, there was a steady improvement.  The Claimant was discharged on 19 June 2018.  Thereafter there was a further five-week course of antibiotics in order fully to treat the dental infection.
It was Dr Leigh’s opinion that, on the balance of probabilities, the episode of ischaemic colitis was precipitated by NSAIDs used as an analgesic in the weeks before admission.  The need for the NSAIDs was brought about as a consequence of the dental work and subsequent, related infection.  Without the excessive pain caused by the dental work and infection and requiring the NSAIDs, the Claimant would not have developed ischaemic colitis, suffered associated pain and been hospitalised.  Ongoing bowel disturbance is a direct consequence, described as post-traumatic and stress-related irritable bowel syndrome.  Care and treatment at Addenbrookes Hospital was timely and competent.  The condition and prognosis section of the report described specific aspects of bowel changes, which have also led to significant stress and anxiety.  The Claimant’s past history revealed no other cause for the colitis.  Dr Leigh’s examination noted the Claimant to appear quite self-conscious about her appearance in relation to her lower jaw.
Dr Leigh explained that NSAID-induced ischaemic colitis is a rare but well-recognised clinical condition.  With the correct dietary and gastroenterological input, he opined that the Claimant’s symptoms should improve substantially over the two to three years following his examination.
The Second Defendant posed additional questions for Dr Leigh, in accordance with Part 35 CPR, arising from entries in the Claimant’s medical records from 2009 and 2016.  These made reference to abdominal and/or bowel difficulties.  Further questions were posed seeking clarity about Dr Leigh’s opinion on matters of NSAIDs and any connection with ischaemic colitis.  Dr Leigh responded by explaining that at the time of his first report he had not had sight of the Claimant’s General Practitioner medical records.  He highlighted entries from 2005/6, 2009/10 and 2015/16, but expressed the opinion that the symptoms associated with her episode of ischaemic colitis were quite different in nature from the earlier problems she experienced, and more consistent with a functional diagnosis of irritable bowel syndrome.  In answer to the NSAID-related questions, Dr Leigh stated that ischaemic colitis can occur even if the NSAIDs are taken in the correct dosage, depending on the sensitivity of the individual to them.  A clinician prescribing medication ought to be aware of any other medications being taken.  Dr Leigh had seen no evidence that the Claimant had not followed the correct dosing regime and instructions.  Asked specifically about pseudomembranous colitis due to infection, Dr Leigh described the evidence as “strongly in favour” of ischaemic colitis.  He stated in evidence that his opinion had not changed following receipt of the general practitioner records.  He clarified that he had asked about previous bowel problems and whether the Claimant had any prior to the dental treatment.  There was one short-lived bowel disturbance that did not reveal a severe underlying condition.  Neither this nor other abdominal complaints were, in Dr Leigh’s opinion, the same condition as the colitis, at least on balance of probabilities.  Although ischaemic colitis is a very rare complication, Dr Leigh has himself witnessed NSAIDs causing it.  It is a condition which is often misdiagnosed, but once diagnosed the treatments are well understood.  He repeated that on the balance of probabilities the NSAIDs caused the ischaemic colitis and he explained how he came to that opinion in some detail.  He did not consider that hypertension was the likely cause.  He added that the clinicians at Addenbrookes also thought that NSAIDs were the cause.
Dr Roger Goulden is a Dental Surgeon and a specialist in restorative dentistry, who provided a report dated 30 December 2020.  He recorded that a denture fitted in November 2018 as part of remedial treatment had fractured more than a year before his appointment with the Claimant, and she can only wear it on a temporary basis, which she does when in company.  There appeared to be no medical history relevant to the delivery of dental treatment.  The Claimant reported significant embarrassment from the lack of lower front teeth as well as the difficulties in eating certain foods.  There was also some tenderness in the lower gum.  Dr Goulden was clear that the Claimant required urgent replacement of her missing lower front teeth and he provided details of a number of treatment options, together with likely costs.
Professor Harding is a Professor of Dentistry, as well as Dean of the City of London Dental School.  In his report he recounted the history of the First Defendant’s treatment of the Claimant in 2016 and then the appointments in May 2018.  The report undertook a review of the Claimant’s clinical records from her regular dentist, Epping Dental.  The report then considered the First Defendant’s clinical records, which were described as “handwritten in black or green ink and some of the entries being illegible”.  There were two OPG radiographs available, which were photographs taken from a computer screen and difficult to read.  Professor Harding’s report noted the findings of examination in 2016, including the OPG radiograph, for which there was no report of the findings, but did not show any obvious pathology associated with LL2 and LR2.  However, superimposed was a tracing of an implant between these teeth, which showed that the implant diameter and trajectory would be close to the roots of both teeth with the impression of cutting into the root of LR2.
On 25 May 2018, the records state that consent was given to the removal of the lower bridge and the placement of an implant.  In evidence, Professor Harding made the point that the failure to conduct a proper assessment, including measurement of the bone, meant that the Claimant was not properly advised about risks and therefore not properly consented.  The absence of details in the records also undermined the consent – the First Defendant acknowledged that everything was not documented, saying “it is what it is”.  No periapical radiographs were taken.  On 30 May 2018, bone mapping was carried out at the site of LL1/LR1 with an implant placed.  A post-operative OPG was taken, reporting the implant position as “ok”.  The Claimant was to return for review after one month, but she returned on 31 May 2018, following an emergency appointment with her general dentist.  The records list the options presented to the Claimant.  RCT commenced at this appointment on LL2, the notes saying that advice was given that it may be necessary on LR2, which was also tender to percussion.  The radiograph from Blue Sky Dental of 4 June 2018 showed the tip of the implant to be associated with radiolucency.  The implant body was in very close proximity to the neighbouring tooth and gave the impression of touching the side of the LL2 root.  The LR2 had a partial root filling that did not reach the apex of the tooth and was poorly condensed.  Professor Harding also reviewed the records from the Cambridge Dental Hub on 7 June 2018.  The Claimant was advised about the need for a CT scan, which showed that the implant was large and was touching LL2, with radiolucency seen around the implant.  The Claimant was told that it would be very difficult to remove the implant and this should be done only in hospital.  Subsequently, the implant and both LL2 and LR2 were removed.  Professor Harding’s report reviewed the subsequent treatment of the Claimant by various dentists.
Professor Harding’s opinion began by noting that the Claimant’s account was consistent with the records he reviewed.  He was concerned that some aspects of the First Defendant’s records may have not been contemporaneous but added to later.  Even if this was not the case, the records do not satisfy the General Dental Council requirements for detail.  He also highlighted discrepancies in the records that caused him to conclude that they could not be factually relied upon.  These included a lack of mention of any distress or pain management, including an absence of dosages for top up anaesthetic.  The 2016 BPE score and presence of bleeding and calculus indicated periodontal disease, which should have been diagnosed and treated appropriately.  Implant treatment was contraindicated until such disease was stabilised.  A competent assessment by a dental surgeon specialising in implant dentistry ought to have found that such treatment was not appropriate for the Claimant.  In response to the First Defendant’s assertion that in 2018 the BPE was 212 212, Professor Harding responded that this was not documented and it would not have mattered if the BPE was 0.  Implantology is appropriate for carefully selected and assessed patients, but that the Claimant was not suitable for it.  He said in the Claimant’s case, he did not think that an implant would make a significant difference to oral health and a bridge remained a better option.  The referral by the other dentist was for a second opinion from a specialist.  He rejected the suggestion that a number of dentists would have put in an implant as the First Defendant had.
The implant tracing superimposed on the 2016 OPG showed the implant diameter and trajectory would be close to the roots of LL2 and LR2, if not actually cutting into them.  A radiograph from Addenbrookes showed that the space between LL2 and LR2 was 5.92mm.  The implant diameter to be inserted was 3.7mm, requiring a minimum space of 6.7mm.  In addition to the periodontal disease, there was insufficient space safely to accommodate the implant.  As there had never been a tooth at the LL1/LR1 space, the alveolar ridge width would on the balance of probabilities have been very narrow and unlikely to have been the 7mm needed.  Professor Harding did not agree with the First Defendant that 1mm either side of the implant site was sufficient.  Although narrower implants are available, they are considered in some circles to have a lower success rate.  Given the lack of bone width and space between the existing teeth, a CBCT scan should have been taken properly to plan the case and determine the amount of available bone safely to house the implant and minimise the risk to adjacent teeth.  The First Defendant’s assessment through superimposing an implant template on the 2016 OPG should have alerted her to the need for a CBCT scan and to the significant risk of damage to LL2 and LR2.  The OPG radiographs were not reported on in the notes and the lack of width was not recorded or calculated.  A competently conducted clinical examination of the Claimant would have flagged up the discrepancy in tooth widths and obvious lack of space at LL1/LR1 for an implant.  Without a proper assessment it would not have been possible to explain and discuss the risks of benefits of implant treatment and to advise the Claimant of the best options in her specific case.
Professor Harding disagreed with the First Defendant’s suggestion that she was not wrong to rely on the 2016 panoramic x-ray.  He said two years had elapsed and building a whole new treatment plan on such an out of date x-ray was wrong.  Even if treatment had been discussed in 2016, nothing was actually done.  Pathology may have developed around the bridge teeth over that time, which may not be apparent from a mere clinical examination.  The OPG radiograph was also not providing the necessary view to assess bone.  Any reasonable dentist would have taken a PA radiograph to check for the health and pathology around the relevant teeth.  This could have been done in the clinic, it did not require going elsewhere.  These were also not spelt out in the generic consent form.  The report set out appropriate options for the Claimant.
Having embarked on the implant procedure on 30 May 2018, there was ineffective management of pain during the procedure.  The severe pain described by the Claimant was unsurprising given the “low dose of local anaesthetic given”.  The First Defendant topped up the anaesthetic to what she said was the maximum, but did not record the dosage of each top-up.  Lack of pain control would be one reason why it would be prudent to abandon implant treatment and, before insertion of the implant, without detriment to the patient.  Continuing the procedure with a patient moving and in pain is dangerous as it increases the chances of complications, such as poor implant positioning, implant failure or harm to the patient.  In the circumstances of the Claimant, the First Defendant should have stopped the procedure.  It was not possible to confirm whether the pain felt by the Claimant was due to infection but on the balance of probabilities there would have been pain due to the damage caused to LL2 from the implant cutting into its root.
On the balance of probabilities the sensitivity of LR2 arose because of bone and gum loss caused by the inappropriate and poorly executed implant treatment and post-operative management of the complications.  The OPG radiograph of 30 May 2018 should have resulted in a PA radiograph to determine the extent of the damage caused to LL2.  The correct course of treatment would have been removal of the implant, avoiding unnecessary prolonged stress and pain for the Claimant.  This would on balance have reduced the amount of bone loss from the ridge.  The First Defendant put to Professor Harding that she provided the Claimant with various options at this stage, to which he pointed out that the Claimant did not have the experience to know which option to choose.  Had things been explained properly, most reasonable patients would have said to remove the implant to avoid risk of being in continuing pain.
Due to the damage to LL2 and the possibly unnecessary and inadequate RCT of LR2, they had to be removed.  The use of LL3 and LR3 as supports for a long span bridge was reasonable in the Claimant’s circumstances, though there is a slightly increased risk of nerve death in such teeth.  This happened with LL3 which was root filled following removal of a fractured instrument, a recognised complication of the procedure.  This has also led to tooth weakening, and although it is presently supporting the bridge, there is an increased risk of fracture in the future.  Therefore, to preserve LL3, the bridge should be replaced with an implant supported bridge.  Bone grafting will also be needed where there has been bone loss.  Professor Harding also dealt with long-term prognosis and future treatment costs.
As to liability, Professor Harding opined that the First Defendant’s treatment of the Claimant was below the standard she could reasonably have expected under a number of headings:
The Claimant was advised to undergo implant treatment which was not a viable treatment option;
A failure to make, keep and make available full, comprehensive and accurate clinical records;
A failure to assess fully and plan the proposed implant treatment;
A failure to obtain the necessary pre-operative radiographs;
A failure to obtain informed consent from the Claimant;
A failure to recognise that the placement of an implant at LL1/LR1 would inevitably fail;
A failure to assess the risks and consequences associated with the provision of implant treatment;
A failure to report on the OPG radiographs;
Unnecessary and inadequate RCT to LR2;
A failure to manage the Claimant’s interoperative and postoperative complications and pain;
A failure to remove the failed implant once the poor positioning had been seen on the OPG radiograph and given the Claimant’s symptoms.
As to causation, Professor Harding was of the opinion that the above breaches of duty directly caused the Claimant:
To undergo an unnecessary surgical operation which caused her pain and suffering both during and after the procedure;
Tooth LL2 required root treatment solely due to the damage caused by the implant and for the same reason eventually required extraction;
Tooth LR2 required extraction as it was painful and associated with periapical infection, due to the substandard RCT, which was not required;
Loss of bone and gum tissue from the anterior mandible resulting in tooth sensitivity and the inability to wear or tolerate a removable denture;
A long span bridge had to be inserted to restore the lost incisor teeth, placing the abutment teeth at LL3 and LR3 at risk of nerve death;
LR3 became sensitive and painful;
LL3 nerve died and required RCT;
The Claimant will require an implant supported restoration which would not have been the case;
The Claimant will require a bone graft prior to implant placement which would not otherwise have been the case;
The Claimant underwent a long period of pain as a result of the inadequacies identified, in addition to having two teeth removed (LL2 and LR2).  These had been free of pathological change prior to the First Defendant’s intervention and should have functioned for a lifetime;
The Claimant also required LL3 and LR3 to be crowned so they could be used as support for her long span bridge.  They would otherwise never have been involved in supporting the bridge, had LL2 and LR2 not needed extraction, and they should then have had normal function for a lifetime.
In relation to the above findings, Professor Harding accepted that if the First Defendant did not perform the RCT on LR2 then point (i) under liability and point (c) under causation would not apply.  LR2 could then be removed from points (k) and (l) under causation.  He pointed out, however, that the loss of LR2 was according to Addenbrooke’s because of infection, which was not present prior to the First Defendant’s work on the Claimant’s teeth.
As to psychosomatic pain, this was possible, but if having exhausted anaesthesia options a patient is still not able to lie still and be compliant then it is not safe to proceed.  In these circumstances, the dentist is in charge and must make the call to stop the procedure.
Factual conclusions
In reaching factual findings in this case, I have reminded myself of the need for the Claimant to establish her claim on the balance of probabilities against either or both of the Defendants.  In assessing the oral evidence of witnesses I have taken account of what they said in writing and during the trial in the context of all the evidence, for example how consistent it is with other evidence not in dispute or which I find to be reliable.  I have also taken into account how well the witness’ evidence withstood challenge in cross-examination.
Having listened with care to the evidence of the Claimant and the First Defendant, I am satisfied that I prefer the Claimant’s evidence wherever there is a conflict.  The Claimant’s ability to recall, at times with vivid detail, her appointments and experiences at the First Defendant’s clinic in 2016 and 2018 is to be contrasted with the First Defendant’s reliance on her usual practice as well as on factual assertions that, on her own admission, should have been but were not documented in her clinical records.
As to the expert evidence, although the First Defendant made reference to some opinions from other clinicians, there was no formal, properly admissible evidence to counter the detailed opinions of, in particular, Professor Harding and Dr Leigh.  Both of these experts were cross-examined in some detail about the conclusions they had reached and I am satisfied that their opinions were cogent, balanced and informed by all the available and relevant professional records.
With these introductory remarks, I have reached the following conclusions:
For the appointments in May 2018, the Claimant contracted with BDL for the provision of dental services.  The documentary evidence supports the contracting parties being the Claimant and BDL, as does the First Defendant’s evidence about the way in which she is remunerated by the company.  The fact that she is the sole director of the company does not detract from this finding.
The dental services were provided on behalf of BDL by the First Defendant, as a qualified dentist and dental surgeon (and arguably by such dental nurses as were employed by BDL, although no negligence is alleged against them);
As a result, the First Defendant owed a duty of care to the Claimant in the provision of dental services; any suggestion to the contrary is untenable.  The necessary contractual relationship was established to make the Second Defendant potentially liable for any breach, pursuant to the implied contractual term under section 49 Consumer Rights Act 2015 and section 75(1) Consumer Credit Act 1974.
The First Defendant breached her duty of care in a number of significant respects, causing pain, suffering and loss of amenity as well as other losses to the Claimant.  The First Defendant specifically failed to undertake a full and proper assessment of the Claimant’s suitability for the proposed implant procedure.  The suggestion that some general undocumented discussions had in 2016 about an implant, together with reliance on a scan taken at that appointment two years earlier, could found a proper assessment and treatment plan was completely unsound and professionally unjustifiable.  Had there been any substance in the First Defendant’s account of her reliance on what happened in 2016, the BPE results would have made the Claimant an unsuitable candidate for an implant at that time.  I accept Professor Harding’s evidence as to the need to have up-to-date scans for the reasons he gave.  Furthermore, the very specific presentation of the Claimant with a small, single tooth space where two teeth would normally have been, was another contraindicator to the suitability of an implant and certainly to suitability without the most careful and detailed contemporaneous assessment of the intended site.
By her own admission, the First Defendant did not inform the Claimant that the proposed implant procedure, which normally requires 1.5mm clearance either side of the implant post, was to be attempted with the lower 1mm clearance on either side – and not with the reduced diameter post of 3.3mm but the more usual 3.7mm post.  This alone vitiates any consent obtained as there would be an increased risk of failure and or damage to the adjacent teeth about which the Claimant had not been informed.  The First Defendant eventually in evidence accepted that the consent form was merely generic, without any specificity directed to the Claimant and her personal situation.
The First Defendant therefore failed to advise the Claimant properly or at all about the inappropriate nature of an implant in her circumstances and failed to advise properly or at all about the actual risks inherent in the procedure for this Claimant.  The First Defendant therefore failed to obtain informed consent for the removal of the bridge and for the implant procedure.
In respect of the bone mapping that the First Defendant undertook to be satisfied about bone integrity and size to take the implant post, she accepted with hindsight that what she did may not have been enough.  Professor Harding’s view is that what was done, whatever it is called and whether or not it is a generally recognised technique for some forms of bone assessment, was quite inadequate in the circumstances of the Claimant to be satisfied that the procedure was safe and could proceed as intended.  I accept his evidence on this point.  Just because the concept of bone mapping may be a technique used by some professionals in some circumstances does not mean that its use in all circumstances will be defensible under the Bolam test.  What the First Defendant did to assess bone in the specific situation presented by this Claimant is what must be judged, not whether a technique used is or is not one in general use.
Having nonetheless proceeded with the poorly planned treatment, the First Defendant inserted the post in such a way that it was angled and impinging on the root of LL2.  Whether the poor positioning of the post was due to the First Defendant’s lack of sufficient planning, due to the lack of sufficient care in carrying out the procedure, due to the Claimant’s understandable inability to remain static due to the significant pain she was experiencing or due to a combination of these and/or other reasons, matters not.  They are all the responsibility of the First Defendant as she was the one who should have appreciated that one or more of the risks involved must be manifesting itself/themselves.  The First Defendant in oral evidence seemed to ascribe responsibility to the Claimant for not staying still, but her dismissive attitude to what she called psychosomatic pain and the Claimant’s vivid description of the procedure on 30 May 2018 lead me to find that the First Defendant ignored the obvious signs of pain and distress that continued to be shown by the Claimant, despite increased anaesthesia.  As Professor Harding said, if the patient cannot stay still so that the procedure can be undertaken safely, the onus is on the dentist to stop the procedure.  The failure of the First Defendant to cease the procedure resulted in the damage to LL2 and much of the excruciating pain suffered by the Claimant at the time.
The First Defendant was equally dismissive, if not more so, of the suggestion that the Claimant developed infection.  I am satisfied that she did refer to the Claimant’s dentist as an “idiot” for making the suggestion.  This is not something the Claimant misremembered.  The First Defendant’s reaction was over the telephone, before she had even had the chance to examine the Claimant and to see for herself whatever it was that gave cause for concern.  This was most unprofessional and, indeed, her absolute assertion about the impossibility of it being an infection turned out be misguided.  The Claimant did indeed develop an infection, which in due course contributed to the demise of LR2 as well as to significant pain and discomfort.
As to the treatment of the Claimant’s presentation on 31 May 2018, I am satisfied that the First Defendant was responsible for the RCT (at least to the extent that it was attempted and partially completed) on both LL2 and LR2.  The precise motivation for the First Defendant’s denial of responsibility for the poor quality RCT of LR2 is unclear, but the x-ray evidence provides only a very small window of four days within which it could have been done.  There is no evidence of any other dentist undertaking the RCT of LR2, despite dental records from various dentists etc being made available.  The Claimant’s evidence was dismissed by the First Defendant on the grounds that the Claimant would not know which teeth were being worked on.  This is another example of a confident assertion by the First Defendant that does not stand up to scrutiny.  It is the First Defendant’s notes that have been found to be incomplete and, as Professor Harding suggested, therefore unreliable as a comprehensive, contemporaneous record.
I am satisfied that the very significant pain and discomfort and the need to keep consulting with emergency and other dentists was the direct result of the First Defendant’s breaches of duty.  I am further satisfied that the loss of LL2 and thereafter LR2 is directly related to the Defendant’s negligence in treating the Claimant.  LR2 was damaged either by infection and/or by poorly executed, attempted RCT.
I am also satisfied that damage to the Claimant’s bone was also a direct consequence of the negligence of the First Defendant.  This applies equally to actual and planned remedial work which has and will remain significant in terms of scope and cost.  This includes the word done on LL3 and LR3 to allow them to shoulder the wide span bridge.
As regards the gastrointestinal matters for which the Claimant was admitted to hospital, I am satisfied on the clear and well-supported evidence of Dr Leigh that the Claimant developed ischaemic colitis and that it arose as an albeit rare but known complication from the taking of NSAIDs.  I reject the Second Defendant’s challenge to the Claimant’s case on this, which seems to ignore the direct evidence on the point from Dr Leigh that (i) his questions were about bowel dysfunction not abdominal pain; and (ii) his opinion did not alter at all following receipt of the general practitioner records.  It was open to the Second Defendant to serve expert evidence to challenge the findings of the experts relied on by the Claimant.  The Second Defendant did not do so and was unable to undermine the cogent evidence and opinion of the experts who did give evidence.
It follows that I find that the Claimant succeeds against both the First and Second Defendants on liability, including for the ischaemic colitis.
Quantum
The Claimant was 54 years and four months’ old at the time of the May 2018 appointments.
The Claimant and Second Defendant addressed quantum in detail in their closing submissions.
General damages
I have considered the competing arguments as to damages relating to the loss of teeth and the ischaemic colitis and have reached the following conclusions:
In respect of the Claimant’s dentition, she lost LL2 and LR2, she has lost the nerve in LL3 and both LL3 and LR3 have had to be significantly altered to act as shoulders for the longer bridge.  The work on these two teeth is known to weaken them and the risk of fracture is increased.  There was excruciating pain during the initial treatment over an extended period of time, much remedial treatment already and a continuing need for more, all due to the First Defendant’s negligence.  In all the circumstances, I agree with the submission of the Claimant that the award for this aspect of general damages should be £11,410, that is the top of the bracket in the Judicial College guidelines.
In respect of the ischaemic colitis, the Claimant developed this as a rare but known complication of the taking of NSAIDs.  She did not have a pre-existing condition involving colitis and I reject the Second Defendant’s submissions about a failure to disclose previous abdominal pain, which are inconsistent with the evidence of the Claimant and Dr Leigh at trial and my findings above.  The Claimant was sufficiently unwell that she required a hospital admission for 9/10 days and there is a continuing condition, albeit she manages it in the main through diet and the avoidance of triggers.  The rubric of the Judicial Guideline leads me to agree with the Claimant’s submission that there should be an award between the two specified brackets.  I acknowledge that there may be some limited crossover between the teeth award and the colitis award, and have taken this into account.  In the circumstances, I assess the appropriate award for the colitis as £30,000.
The total award for general damages is therefore £41,410.
As to special damages, I deal with these in the table below:
Description
Amount awarded
Reasoning
Initial treatment cost
£3,416
Already discounted to allow for treatment that Claimant should have received and paid for.  Claimant’s submissions adopted.
Past remedial treatment
£7,938
Costs reasonable and recoverable, having considered individual invoices and costs.  Claimant’s submissions adopted.
Medication
£580
No failure to mitigate established.
Travel
£375
The Claimant accepts this is an estimated rather than detailed cost.  Having considered submissions, I make this award.
Holiday transfer cost
£0
This is precisely the type of loss that is so easily capable of being supported by documentary evidence. Although the Claimant gave evidence about it, it should have been supported by documentary evidence.  No explanation was given as to why it was not so evidenced.
Care
£594.30
This figure is not disputed by the Second Defendant and it does relate to the period after the Claimant’s husband returned from America and effectively became the Claimant’s carer.  It is reasonable and recoverable.
Loss of earnings
£11,500
I accept it is likely that (a) the Claimant would have sought work; (b) would have sought and found at least part-time work, given her work history and experience; (c) would have been remunerated at at least the minimum wage, on balance part-time work being less likely to replicate her previous managerial role and income; and (d) the problems preventing her working would have persisted for a couple of years, but must be seen in the context of the onset of Covid restrictions in spring 2020 and that this may have reduced or curtailed her employment.  This is a loss of chance case and I make a modest reduction to reflect this.  I have calculated the minimum wage payment for 20 hours per week over the course of 18 months (= £12,807.60) discounted to £11,500.
Future remedial treatment
£16,050
I accept the Claimant’s submissions based on the future treatment costs provided for by Professor Harding and based on my assessment of his evidence at trial.
Repeating costs
£5800
Once the future remedial treatment has been completed the Claimant will have broadly been put into the position that she would have been if there had been no negligence, save in respect of LL3 and LR3.  As Professor Harding noted “all dental restorations have a finite life expectancy” and the Claimant would have had one type of dental restoration or another, irrespective of the First Defendant’s negligence.  The crowns at LL3 and LR3 will require replacement as a direct result of the negligent treatment (£900 x 2).  There will be an extra cost every ten years for three-unit implant bridge instead of a one-unit one (£2000 x 2).
Possible future and repeating costs
£0
These projected costs in Professor Harding’s report are based on a 25% risk that LL3 will require an implant within 10-15 years.  I am not satisfied that this is recoverable as a potential future cost.
Total for special damages
£46,253.30
Total damages
£87,663.30
For the avoidance of doubt, the Second Defendant is entitled to an indemnity and/or contribution from the First Defendant in respect of damages and costs.  Insofar as damages are concerned such indemnity/contribution would be on a 100% basis.  In respect of costs, the Court will need to consider the form of order, and any relevant submissions, before determining the issue (albeit in principle the Second Defendant is likely to be entitled to recoup costs that it is required to pay on 100% basis).  Though jointly and severally liable, there was no suggestion that the Second Defendant was liable other than through the mechanism of the Consumer Credit Act 1974.

SUMMARY
Practice and Procedure
This judgment concerns nine appeals against decisions of the Employment Tribunal (“ET”) to transfer the proceedings in the underlying cases to the ET office at Watford.  When communicating these decisions, in all but the case relating to Wolf Data Systems, there had been a failure to identify the relevant decision-taker and/or to provide reasons for the decision and, to that extent, the appeals in question would be formally allowed.  When considering disposal, however, it was clear that no injustice arose from the transfer decisions and, applying the overriding objective, there could only be one answer: dealing with the proceedings fairly and justly required that the claims be transferred to the Watford office of the ET.  As the errors identified could thus have no material effect on the result, it was appropriate, pursuant to section 35 Employment Tribunals Act 1996, to exercise the powers of the ET and to confirm each of the transfer decisions made (Jafri v Lincoln College [2014] EWCA Civ 449 applied).
THE HONOURABLE MRS JUSTICE EADY DBE, PRESIDENT:
Introduction
This appeal concerns the transfer of Employment Tribunal (“ET”) proceedings between different regions.
In this judgment, when addressing the individual cases, we refer to the parties by name; more generally, however, we use titles (claimant; respondent) as before the ET.  Each of these cases comes before us as an appeal against a decision of the ET to transfer the proceedings in the claim in question to the ET office at Watford.  Five of the respondents to these appeals have been debarred as having failed to enter a respondent’s answer; communications sent to the respondent in EA-2022-001155-AT have been returned undelivered and no representation from the respondent has been received in relation to the appeal in that case.  At the hearing before us, the claimant has appeared in person, as he has at all stages of the proceedings save when he was represented by leading counsel (acting under the Employment Law Appeals Advice Scheme; “ELAAS”) at a hearing under rule 3(10) Employment Appeal Tribunal Rules 1993 on 23 November 2023, which concerned the first five appeals before us.  The respondent in EA-2022-000639-AT has been represented by counsel, and the respondents in EA-2021-001131-AT and EA-2023-000834-AT have appeared by non-professional representatives of those entities.
Applications made by the claimant at, and after, the hearing
Application to reinstate grounds of appeal
In the early hours of the morning of the hearing, the claimant emailed the EAT, attaching a document described as “a submission about requests due to the fact that Regional Employment Judge Foxwell has not complied with the order of Judge Shanks because he has failed to provide the documents requested by his order” (what was said to be an “improved submission” was then sent at 9.01am).  The submission was in fact an application (albeit not made on the relevant application form) for permission to reinstate grounds of appeal previously rejected by His Honour Judge Shanks in relation to the first five appeals before us (and, we should add, by other Judges of the EAT when permitting the remaining appeals to also proceed to a full hearing), by which the claimant had sought to allege that the decisions made by the ET demonstrated victimisation and bias on the part of Regional Employment Judge (“REJ”) Foxwell.  We addressed this application at the outset of the hearing of the appeal, providing our reasons for rejecting it at that stage, which are now set out in this judgment.
To provide context, when permitting the first five appeals to proceed to a full hearing on 23 November 2022, HHJ Shanks had requested the ET to supply copies of any letters containing requests made to other REJs for claims involving the claimant to be transferred to the ET’s Watford office.  Due to delays on the part of the EAT administration, however, HHJ Shanks’ order was only seal dated (and sent out) on 29 April 2023.
REJ Foxwell responded to that request by letter of 8 June 2023 (explaining that this was when the EAT’s request was drawn to his attention).  We return to the content of that response in our substantive judgment, below.  It was, however, the claimant’s submission that REJ Foxwell had failed to provide the documents required by the EAT and that his account was not accurate as minutes of meetings of the ET national user group do not record any requests being made to other REJs regarding the claimant’s claims.  The claimant also says that it is unlikely that the London REJs would have been aware of his claims as, at the relevant time (January 2021), he had “lodged only a limited number of claims in each of the three other London Employment Tribunals”.  The claimant contends that REJ Foxwell’s delay in responding to the EAT’s order dated 23 November 2022 (and what he describes as REJ Foxwell’s failure to “say the truth” in saying it had only been drawn to his attention in June 2023), and his failure to then properly comply, provides “a new and further evidence of victimisation and bias against me”.  The original source of this “victimisation and bias” is said to derive from the fact that the claimant had previously made a complaint against an employment Judge sitting at Watford; as the relevant REJ, that complaint would have been dealt with by REJ Foxwell.
We have no hesitation in rejecting this application to reinstate grounds of appeal dismissed at a hearing in November 2022, as confirmed by order sent to the parties on 29 April 2023.  Although it would seem that the EAT only sent REJ Foxwell’s response of 8 June 2023 to the parties on 11 October 2023, the claimant has still waited over a year before making this application.  Certainly there is nothing “new” that would warrant an application being made on the morning of the full hearing to reinstate grounds of appeal that the claimant knew had been dismissed over two years ago.  We are, moreover, satisfied that the application is misconceived.  REJ Foxwell’s explanation makes clear why no further documents were sent in response to HHJ Shanks’ request: the subject of the claimant’s various ET claims was raised orally at a meeting on 4 January 2021 of London and South East REJs (not the national user group); thereafter the transfers took place administratively by email.  As for why the London REJs might have been aware of the claimant’s claims, the print-out we have obtained from the ET suggests that some 12 claims had been lodged by the claimant in the London regions at the relevant time and, given the nature of the claims we have seen (written in the same manner, making claims in respect of job advertisements for which no application had been made), it would be appropriate for issues of case management to come to the attention of the relevant REJs.
Had the claimant wished to challenge the dismissal of the grounds of appeal that he now seeks to reinstate, the appropriate course would have been for him to make the necessary application for permission to appeal to the Court of Appeal within 21 days of the seal date of the relevant EAT order (as was made clear in HHJ Shanks’ order seal dated 29 April 2023).  To the extent that the claimant says it was only after receiving REJ Foxwell’s response of 8 June 2023 that he considered there was a proper basis for applying to reinstate those grounds of appeal, it would then have been open to him to either apply (out of time) to the EAT for review, or to apply (out of time) for permission to appeal to the Court of Appeal.  Instead, the claimant has waited over a year after receiving REJ Foxwell’s response to make this application.  For the reasons we have provided, the application to reinstate previously dismissed grounds of appeal is dismissed as being totally without merit.
Application for further information from the ET
Notwithstanding our preliminary ruling on the claimant’s application relating to REJ Foxwell’s response of 8 June 2023, the claimant then returned to this issue at various points when making his submissions, continuing to repeat his contention that REJ Foxwell failed to comply with HHJ Shanks’ request.  This ultimately culminated in the claimant requesting that the EAT should now order REJ Foxwell to provide further documentation and/or clarification.  We decided to treat this as a separate application, reaching our decision after hearing the claimant’s submissions in this regard.  For reasons given orally at the hearing, we also refused this application, finding that it was totally without merit.  Again, we have set out those reasons in this judgment for ease of reference.
The claimant’s application for the EAT to order REJ Foxwell to provide further documentation/information – in particular, minutes of the REJ meeting of 4 January 2021 - was made on largely the same grounds as his application to reinstate previously dismissed grounds of appeal: it was his contention that REJ Foxwell had not been honest in his explanation and that there must be documentation available that he had failed to disclose.  Again the claimant suggested that REJ Foxwell had delayed in responding to the EAT and he further complained of the EAT’s delay in forwarding the response to the parties.
While we can see that the delays on the part of the EAT were unhelpful, we have not been able to investigate why this occurred and have to bear in mind the heavy workload faced by the administrative staff.  In any event, the seal date on HHJ Shanks’ order makes clear that this was not sent to the ET until 29 April 2023, so it is not correct to say (as the claimant has maintained) that REJ Foxwell’s delay was from 23 November 2022 (the date of the rule 3(10) hearing) to 8 June 2023.  Moreover, given our experience of the administrative delays in both the EAT and ET, we find it entirely plausible that the EAT’s request did not then find its way to REJ Foxwell until early June 2023.  We do not draw any inference of undue delay on the part of the REJ.  The same cannot, however, be said of the claimant.  As the record makes clear, REJ Foxwell’s response of 8 June 2023 was sent out to all parties on 11 October 2023; if the claimant considered this raised legitimate concerns as to the content of that response, he could have made an application to the EAT at that stage.  We can see no proper reason for the delay in making an application for disclosure of any minutes from the REJ meeting of 4 January 2021.  In any event, it is apparent to us that a written record of what transpired at that meeting was sent to the claimant by letter from REJ Foxwell on 19 January 2021, and there is no reason to consider that does other than set out the nature of the discussion, providing an explanation for why the claimant’s claims before the different London ET regions were then transferred to the Watford office.  For all these reasons, we refuse this application for an order that the ET provide further disclosure/information; we are satisfied that this is an application that has been pursued vexatiously and is totally without merit.
Application for recusal and re-hearing
Subsequent to the oral hearing in these appeals, by email sent at 4.41pm on Sunday 15 December 2024, the claimant applied for me to recuse myself, asking that his appeals should be re-listed to be heard afresh by another Judge, with new lay members.  The grounds relied on in support of that application were put on the following bases (I summarise): (1) I had previously heard appeals brought by the claimant when sitting in Edinburgh in July 2023 (Ramos v Lady Coco Ltd [2023] EAT 99), when I dismissed the appeals as being totally without merit and found the claimant’s conduct of that litigation to have been vexatious; (2) as President of the EAT, I decided which Judge would hear an appeal and, therefore, had chosen to preside over the hearing of the current appeals; (3) a Judge should not choose to deal with an appeal because she already knows the appellant; (4) my behaviour during the hearing on 11 December 2024 confirmed the appearance of bias (in this regard, the claimant alleges that I spoke to him in a hostile manner, and on one occasion replied to him in an aggressive way, shouting at him to “Not bring this back again”).
As this is an application that has been made when the appeals were already before the full panel, I have sought the views of Mr Aziz and Mr Torrance; the following constitutes the unanimous decision of the three of us.
First, it is a matter of record that I presided over the hearing of the claimant’s appeals in Lady Coco.  The claimant would, of course, have been aware of that fact when the EAT cause list was published (in the normal course, the cause list is published towards the end of the week preceding any listing), making it clear that I was due to preside over the current appeals; no application for recusal was made in advance of the hearing.  Similarly, the claimant made no application for recusal at the hearing on 11 December 2024 itself;  rather he waited until after the weekend after the hearing, notwithstanding that it had been made clear that the panel would be starting its deliberations immediately after the oral submissions had been completed.  Most pertinently (and in any event), as is apparent from my judgment in the Lady Coco case, my rulings in those appeals related to the claimant’s conduct of that litigation.  I was not required to form any view as to the merit of the appellant’s appeals (or his conduct of the litigation) in the nine matters that are now before us, and I did not do so.  In the circumstances, there were no proper grounds on which I was required to recuse myself from sitting on the EAT panel in the current appeals.
Secondly, it is incorrect to say that I chose to preside over these appeals.  Although the listing of cases is a judicial function, the day-to-day compilation of the list is delegated to the administrative staff of the EAT.  On permitting an appeal to proceed to a full hearing, a Judge will assign it to a category and will make other directions, which will enable the listing staff to allocate the matter – in accordance with the directions that have been given - to a Judge available to preside over the hearing on the day or days in question.   As is entirely standard, this matter was duly allocated to me as one of the available Judges for this listing.
As for the suggestion that the claimant was treated in a hostile manner and/or that I was aggressive towards him or shouted at him, this is not the perception of any member of the panel nor is it demonstrated by listening to a recording of the hearing: I maintained the same volume and tone throughout the hearing and, notwithstanding the need to ensure that Mr Okcu (who was positioned some way back in the court in order to be able to sit next to the translator) could hear what I was saying, I did not raise my voice in any way that could be construed as shouting.  Although I announced our two decisions, adverse to the claimant, during the course of the hearing, that was not treating the claimant in a hostile manner; it was merely explaining the decisions reached on his applications.  Similarly, although there were occasions when I had to ask the claimant not to interrupt me, this was part of the case management of the hearing, it could not reasonably be construed as hostility towards the claimant.
We note that the complaints made to support the application for recusal could have been, but were not, made during the hearing itself.  The lack of any proper basis for the allegations made (the claimant would have been aware, for example, that no-one shouted at him during the hearing) would have been apparent to the claimant.  In the circumstances, the application for recusal is refused, and we can only conclude that it has been made vexatiously and is again to be characterised as being totally without merit.
The relevant history
The background
As the list of appeals before us makes clear, the claimant has brought a large number of ET claims against a variety of businesses.  The respondents are usually (although not exclusively) small businesses that have advertised a vacancy using language that might suggest discrimination on the basis of a protected characteristic.  In an earlier case, Ramos v Nottinghamshire Women’s Aid Ltd and anor [2024] EAT 67, in dismissing the claimant’s three appeals in those proceedings as totally without merit, His Honour Judge James Tayler described the position as follows:
“Mr Lorenzo Ramos, also known as Lorenzo Garcia, is a serial litigant in the Employment Tribunals and the EAT. His modus operandi has been to find advertisements on the internet, that appear to be discriminatory, for jobs up and down the British Isles, and then bring claims in the Employment Tribunals, often without having applied for the job. It might be said that employers who do not take care with their job advertisements have only themselves to blame. But Mr Ramos does not act for the public good, he claims loss of earnings and injury to feelings. The wide geographical scope and variety of roles for which Mr Ramos applies puts in question whether he really wishes to be appointed. That question was answered firmly in the negative by the Employment Tribunal in Scotland in Mr L Ramos v Lady Coco Ltd t/a Shamela's Fresh Hot and Cold Food 4110531/2021 where the three members of the Employment Tribunal unanimously concluded (para 32):
“In short, the Tribunal was satisfied from the evidence presented that the claimant had no genuine desire of applying for the role the respondent had advertised. He was solely using the Tribunal process to seek money from the respondent.””
As that extract from HHJ Tayler’s judgment makes apparent, the claimant has brought a large number of ET claims throughout Great Britain.  The present appeals all relate to claims filed in one of the three London regions (London East, London Central, London South); each case was transferred to the ET South East Region.  As at March 2023, 52 claims brought by the claimant were held by the ET South East region.  Following a request made by the EAT to the Watford ET office for the purposes of this hearing, we understand that some 66 claims by the claimant appear on the records.  We understand that these relate to claims brought by the claimant in London and the South East, and do not include claims brought in other regions, or claims brought before the ET in Scotland.  In addition, according to the records held by the EAT, some 42 appeals have also been pursued by the claimant.
Although, as illustrated by the judgment in the Nottinghamshire Women’s Aid case, many of the claimant’s claims and appeals have been dismissed (some being held to be totally without merit), that is not true of all.  In the cases that are now before us, no decision has been taken on the merits and the summary that we provide in each instance is simply taken from the claimant’s ET1 and statement of claim.
The claims in these appeals
In the claim against Wolf Data Systems Ltd (presented on 27 November 2020, and initially assigned to the London Central ET), the claimant complains about what are said to have been two discriminatory advertisements, one for the position of “Female Telesales Agents” and another for the position of “Female Managed print & IT Telesales Agent”.  It does not appear that the claimant applied for either position, but he makes clear his case that that would not have been necessary in order for him to make a claim under the Equality Act 2010.  In setting out his claim, the claimant refers to various authorities, showing (as he put it): “that awards for injury of feelings for direct sex discrimination are very high”.  Within his ET1, the claimant claims some £8,100 by way of financial losses over a six month period, with an additional £4,850 for injury to feelings.  His statement of claim ends as follows:
I advise the Respondent to conciliate for the following reasons:
The Respondent should be realistic and accept that he has made a mistake by posting these two discriminatory adverts and accept to conciliate
The Respondent should understand that any money paid to me within an Acas conciliation agreement would not be money wasted because of the feedback it has received from me which enable him to improve his recruitment process
The Respondent has posted two discriminatory adverts and not only one i.e. one for the position of “Female Telesales Agents” and another for the position of “Female Managed print & IT Telesales Agent”
It is direct discrimination and not only indirect discrimination”
The claim against Chalcot House Services (presented on 9 December 2020, and also initially assigned to London Central ET) is said to relate to a “discriminatory advert for a female domestic cleaner”.  It would again seem that the claimant made no application for the position in question, complains about the content of the advertisement.  Having again referred to what he describes as the “very high” level of awards for injury to feelings, the claimant claims £4,775 by way of financial losses over a six month period, plus £4,850 for injury to feelings.  The statement of claim in this case ends with the claimant again advising the respondent to conciliate, repeating the points made at paragraph 9 a) and b) in the Wolf Data proceedings.
As for the claim against Maid Solutions (presented on 4 January 2021, and initially assigned to the London South ET region), the claimant’s case relates to what are said to have been “two discriminatory advert [sic]”, the first made on 18 August 2020, the second on 5 October 2020, which stated that the company was looking for “a Polish or Bulgarian female cleaner”.  As before, the claim seems to be limited to the content of the advertisements; it does not appear that the claimant applied for either position.  The details of the claimant’s case are set out in a statement in almost identical terms to the earlier cases we have described, with a similar reference to the “very high” awards for injury to feelings made in such proceedings and similar advice to the respondent to enter into conciliation.  In this instance, the claimant seeks financial losses of £2,808 for a period of six months loss of earnings, plus (once again) an award of £4,850 for injury to feelings.
In his claim against Lulu’s Bistro (presented on 4 October 2021, and also initially assigned to London South region), the claimant complains about what is said to have been an advertisement for a “Female Hot Dog Vendor”.   In the statement of claim in this case, the claimant says he was “deterred from applying to this position by the discriminatory contents of the Respondent’s advert”, explaining that he would not apply for a post where he does not meet all the criteria as this would risk misuse of his confidential information and would also take up his time (“I cannot afford to waste time replying to discriminatory adverts for positions”).  Again referring to the “very high” awards made for injury to feelings, the claimant submits that he suffered financial losses for a six month period, in the sum of £8,125, and again claims £4,850 for injury to feelings.
The claim against Hello Services (presented on 15 November 2021, and, similarly, initially assigned to the London South ET region) is said to relate to an advertisement for a “Office administrator job at a home servicing company (female worker needed)”.  In his statement of claim, the claimant again makes clear that he has not applied for the position, explaining that this was because he was not female, because he considered data safety issues would arise in relation to his confidential information, and because it would not be cost effective in terms of his time.  Having again referred to the “very high” awards made for injury to feelings in discrimination claims, on this occasion the claimant makes no claim for financial losses but seeks £8,800 for injury to feelings.  The claimant further states that the director of the company should be added as an individually named respondent “in case the Employment Tribunal awards me a compensation and the company Hello Services Limited does not have enough money to pay me this compensation I can claim also against its director”.
In his claim (presented on 31 August 2022, and also initially assigned to the London South region) against Murat Tchoukour (who seems to have been the director of a company called “The Cooffee Club Ltd”), the claimant states that his complaint relates to an advertisement for a “Female Waitress”.  His statement of claim also seems to refer to a requirement of speaking Bulgarian, Romanian or Albanian, although it is unclear whether this actually relates to the advertisement in issue or whether it is imported from a different claim; certainly large parts of the statement are taken from other proceedings, with similar points being made to those we have already referenced above.  Again the claim in this case is limited to injury to feelings, although this time the level of award is put at £9,100.
The proceedings relating to Clean Therapy Ltd and others (presented on 28 July 2022, again initially assigned to the London South region) involve a complaint about and advertisement for “a reliable, trustworthy, energetic local females who likes cleaning and take pride in their job”.  The claimant’s statement of claim is written in similar terms to the other cases we have referenced and again limits the claim for damages to an injury to feelings award in the sum of £9,100.
The claim against Thoughtful Supermarket Ltd (presented 2 March 2023, also initially assigned to the London South region) is said to relate to an advertisement for “Female Kitchen Staff”.  In his statement of claim the claimant says that he saw the advertisement on 22 September 2022, and applied the same day, only to be rejected on 24 September 2022 “because I am not a female”.  Making no claim for financial losses, the claimant again claims the sum of £9,100 for injury to feelings.
Finally, in his claim against Cafe on the Hill (presented on 14 January 2023, initially assigned to the London South region), the claimant complains about an advertisement for a “Female Waiter”.  This would again seem to be a claim arising from the content of the advertisement, without the claimant having actually applied for the job, and the statement of claim is written in similar terms to the previous cases we have referenced, with compensation being limited to the sum of £9,100 for injury to feelings.
The transfer decisions
As we have already noted, in each of these cases, the claimant’s appeal relates to the transfer of the ET proceedings from one of the ET London regions to the office at Watford, which falls within the South East region.  The background to these transfers is made apparent from the explanation provided by REJ Foxwell (the REJ for the ET South East region) in his letter to the EAT of 8 June 2023 (this resulted from the request from the EAT, made as part of the current proceedings, to which we have referred above), as follows:
“I had raised a question about an unusual pattern and quantity of claims from the claimant at an REJ meeting on 4 January 2021 and asked whether other REJ’s [sic] had received similar claims.  The then REJ’s [sic] for the three London regions responded positively identifying similar claims in their regions.  I offered to accept them so that they could be managed together; this was done by exchange of email.  These discussions are reflected in my letter of 19 January 2021.  Subsequently, the REJ’s [sic] from these Regions transferred other of the claimant’s claims to the South East Region without specifically seeking my consent to accept them (which I would have given in any event).  I cannot say whether this process captured all of the claimant’s claims presented in the London regions as this would depend on each claim coming to the attention of the REJ’s [sic] ...”
The letter of 19 January 2021 to which REJ Foxwell refers was sent to the claimant under his name “Mr Garcia”.  That letter is not, of itself, the subject of an appeal before us and it does not specifically relate to any of the cases with which we are concerned.  It is, however, an important communication, which sets out the reasons for transferring cases brought by the claimant in the London ETs to the office at Watford.
The background to the letter of 19 January 2021 is provided by some of the other correspondence filed by the claimant when lodging the current appeals.  From that material, it is apparent that, by letter of 26 August 2020, REJ Foxwell communicated his decision that three separate claims brought by the claimant in the Watford ET were to be combined for hearing together.  Subsequently, in January 2021, four claims brought by the claimant in the London East ET were transferred to the Watford ET and were consolidated with the proceedings that had already been combined for hearing.  That transfer appears to have been questioned by the claimant, by email of 15 January 2021 (which we have not seen).  The letter of 19 January 2021 then provided REJ Foxwell’s response, which explained (so far as relevant for present purposes) as follows:
“Your email of 15 January 2021 to the East London office of the Employment Tribunal has been referred to me as the judge who requested the transfer of the above cases here.
I have asked Regional Employment Judges Taylor, Wade and Freer for your claims currently proceeding in the London East, London Central and London South Regions respectively to be transferred here. I have done so as these claims do, or may show common features with the claims you have brought in the Employment Tribunal’s South-East Region.
I consider that, at the very least, the respondents to your claims should be aware that you have other similar claims in the system and of the possibility, therefore, that you may achieve double-recovery in respect of any successful claim for loss of earnings (which you pursue in each of the cases I have seen so far).
It is concerning that you have not voluntarily disclosed the fact of your other claims in your various proceedings because of their obvious relevance to any remedy you might receive.
I have directed that the claims ... are to be consolidated ... to be heard by a judge to determine whether all or any part of them should be struck out or made the subject of a deposit order having regard to the following:
each claim involves similar facts;
the claimant in each case gives the same PO Box address but the claimant’s name given in the claim forms differs between Mr Ramos or Mr Garcia; the Tribunal must consider whether this is just one person and, if so, why he uses different names in different claims;
Mr Garcia made a similar claim in case 3318988/2019 (Garcia v The Gift Corner 3 Wishes Limited) which was dismissed and in which adverse findings were made about his credibility and the genuineness of the claim;
the claimant in the current claims makes no reference to the other current ones despite their relevance due to the obvious risk of double-recovery were he to succeed in more than one of them;
while it will be a matter for the judge hearing the case to decide, the above factors suggest that these claims are not based on genuine job applications and should therefore be struck out as an abuse of process or, alternatively, made the subject of a deposit order because they stand little prospect of success. Such orders cannot be made without a hearing.
The Tribunal has made these orders of its own motion because it is unlikely that the individual respondents will be aware of one another, of the similarities between their cases and/or the link between Mr Garcia and Mr Ramos.”
In the case relating to Wolf Data Systems, on 15 July 2021 the parties were told that REJ Wade (REJ for London Central region) had directed that hearings would be postponed and the case transferred to Watford ET for case management purposes; the reasons for that decision were said to be those provided in REJ Foxwell’s letter of 19 January 2021 (which was also attached).
At 11.30 pm that evening, the claimant applied to the ET for the transfer to be cancelled, saying that REJ Foxwell’s decision of 19 January 2021 was “an old order”, only concerning “a small number of claims”:
Hence, a recent order is needed to transfer my claims
And as a consequence this old order cannot justify that REJ Wade persecutes me for the rest of my life by disrupting the normal processing of any claims that I need to issue by transferring them to Watford ...”
And further contending that REJ Foxwell’s reference to “double recovery” could not justify the transfer of the claims as it was “highly hypothetical”.
In responding on 16 July 2021, REJ Wade explained:
“The original January letter concerned only those cases which were known about at the time, but the principle remains the same which is to avoid a risk of double recovery. You (Mr L Garcia/ L Ramos) have brought a number of claims since January, not all of which have been transferred because the Regional Judges were not aware of them, but in future all claims will be transferred to Watford.”
On 19 July 2021, a letter was sent to the parties confirming the transfer of the proceedings to the ET office at Watford.  The claimant’s appeal is made against this letter.
Subsequently, by email of 15 August 2021 to the London Central ET, the claimant set out what he said characterised as “Further evidence concerning my request dated 15 July 2021 to cancel the transfer ... of my claim to Watford [ET]”.  The claimant then set out his assertion that REJ Foxwell had victimised him for having previously made a complaint about an Employment Judge at Watford ET.  We do not know if the claimant received a response to that email but it would be unsurprising if there was no response from the London Central ET given that the proceedings had been transferred to Watford by that stage.
Also by letter of 19 July 2021, the parties were notified that the file in the claim against Chalcot House had been transferred to the ET office at Watford.  Letters confirming the transfer of the claims brought against Maid Solutions, Lulu’s Bistro, and Hello Services Ltd were sent out on 23 March 2022 ; that relating to the case against Clean Therapy and others on 2 September 2022, and that relating to the claim against Murat Tchoukour on 6 September 2022 (the letter in this regard confirming that the claim was being transferred to the Watford office “as directed by Judge Balogun”).  The transfer of the proceedings brought against Thoughtful Supermarket Ltd was confirmed by letter of 20 March 2023, and that relating to Cafe on the Hill by letter of 22 June 2023.
In each of these cases, the claimant’s appeal is made against the letter confirming the transfer of the proceedings to Watford ET.  Save as we have expressly set out above, those letters did not identify the name of any Employment Judge making the decision on transfer, and did not provide any reasons for the transfer.
As we have already noted, in the case involving Wolf Data, the claimant emailed to protest against the transfer of the proceedings, receiving the response from REJ Wade of 16 July 2021, prior to the letter confirming the transfer.  We have also seen emails from the claimant, dated 6 and 9 May 2022, relating to the transfer of his claim against Hello Services Ltd, in which he requested that the “order of transfer” be revoked.  The claimant has told us that he never received any response to that request.  We also understand the claimant says that he made similar requests in other proceedings, similarly without receiving any response.  We will return to this point below.
The issues raised by these appeals
At a hearing under rule 3(10) EAT Rules 1993 on 23 November 2022, His Honour Judge Shanks permitted the appeals in the first five matters before us to proceed to a full hearing.
At the rule 3(10) hearing, the claimant was represented by leading counsel, appearing under ELAAS, who advanced grounds of appeal as follows: that the decisions to transfer these five claims (i) do not name the Judge who made the decision; (ii) do not give any reasons; and (iii) should not have been made without affording the claimant a reasonable opportunity to make representations.  These points have also been permitted to proceed in relation to each of the other appeals before us.  It is convenient to refer to these points  as Ground 1.
HHJ Shanks also allowed some additional grounds, as set out in the original notices of appeal, to proceed in the cases involving Lulu’s Bistro and Hello Services.  These largely make the same points as those identified in Ground 1, but, also make the following complaints: (1) that the transfer did not include any reference to an order from Watford ET requesting the transfer (something we consider can sensibly be addressed as an additional part of Ground (1)); and (2) that the transfer had disrupted the normal processing of the claims, extended the length of the proceedings, increased costs, and could lead to the disclosure of confidential information about the claimant - we have grouped these matters together as Ground 2.
HHJ Shanks otherwise dismissed the claimant’s proposed grounds of appeal, specifically rejecting the following points of complaint:
the suggestion that the transfers were due to victimisation or bias, whether relating to a complaint the claimant had made about a particular Employment Judge at Watford or otherwise: HHJ Shanks found there was no proper basis for this suggestion;
the claimant’s contentions that (i) hearings could not be listed together unless there was a common respondent, (ii) he could not be required to disclose claims he might have against other respondents; (iii) claims were allocated to specific ET offices according to the residence of the respondence, and (iv) that there was no legal basis for a transfer of his claims to the South East region: HHJ Shanks finding these arguments were “just wrong”;
that: (i) he could not receive a fair hearing in Watford from a Judge dealing with numerous claims, (ii) a case cannot be transferred if it will extend the proceedings, and/or (iii) fairness requires his claims be dealt with by different ETs and Judges: HHJ Shanks again finding there was no basis for these suggestions.
The remaining appeals were similarly permitted to proceed to a full hearing by other Judges of the EAT on the same grounds as those allowed by HHJ Shanks (similarly dismissing all other grounds).  In each case, it was directed that the appeal should be combined for hearing with the original five.
In EA-2023-000834-AT, however, by order seal dated 15 September 2023, Judge Stout initially stayed the appeal, to allow the claimant the opportunity to make a reconsideration application to the ET and to apply (out of time) for written reasons for the decision (as communicated by letter of 22 June 2023).  In so directing, Judge Stout identified that this was an appeal against a case management decision (albeit one that could only be made by the ET President or REJ), and explained:
“... it seems to me that the proper course, and that most consistent with the overriding objective including avoiding delay, expense and unnecessary use of tribunal time, is for the claimant first to write to the London South asking for a review of the decision and reasons for the decision. ... Providing that London South does review its decision and produce a new decision within that timeframe, the present appeal is likely to be rendered academic (pointless) so that permission to appeal would then be refused (if the appeal was not withdrawn by the appellant). ...”
The claimant did not, however, adopt the course suggested, and (by email of 21 October 2023) requested the order be revoked or amended “because it asked me to do something which is impossible to do”:
“it is impossible for me to make these two applications at the same time because before I made the application for reconsideration I need to be provided with the reasons ... to decide whether or not to make an application for reconsideration ...
Moreover, we have to accept the reality which is that my application for reconsideration will be very out of time ...”
By further order, seal dated 6 November 2023, Judge Stout lifted the stay and directed that this appeal proceed to a full hearing, along with the eight earlier appeals before us.  Addressing the points made by the claimant, however, Judge Stout opined:
“I initially considered that the proper course, and that most consistent with the overriding objective including avoiding delay, expense and unnecessary use of tribunal time, was for the claimant first to write to the London South asking for a review of the decision and reasons for the decision and I stayed the appeal for 28 days to allow that to happen. Unfortunately, the claimant failed to take that course for reasons that I consider were spurious. He took the view that he could not make an application for review without first obtaining the Tribunal’s reasons, but that was clearly no obstacle as it did not prevent him appealing or setting out his submissions to the Tribunal as to why the transfer order should not have been made. He also considered he would have been out of time, but he would not as the application is for a review of a case management order under Rule 29 to which no time limit applies. Despite the claimant’s failure to take the opportunity I gave him, which is to be deprecated, as I am now aware that there are other appeals proceeding to a full hearing on this point, I grant permission for this appeal to join those other cases.”
The legal framework
Proceedings before the ET are governed by the Employment Tribunals (Constitution and Rules of Procedure) Regulations 2013 (“the 2013 Regulations”).  By regulation 4 it is provided that:
“There are to be tribunals known as employment tribunals.”
Regulation 5 then establishes the office of President of Employment Tribunals for England and Wales (making separate provision for the President of Employment Tribunals for Scotland).  By regulation 6, provision is made for the appointment of Regional Employment Judges.
By regulation 7, the responsibilities of the ET President and REJs are set out as follows:
The President shall, in relation to the area for which the President is responsible, use the resources available to- (a) secure, so far as practicable, the speedy and efficient disposal of proceedings; (b) determine the allocation of proceedings between Tribunals; and (c) determine where and when Tribunals shall sit.
The President ... may direct Regional Employment Judges ... to take action in relation to the fulfilment of the responsibilities in paragraph (1) and the Regional Employment Judges ... shall follow such directions.”
By regulation 11, it is provided that the President may make practice directions about ET procedure; such practice directions supplement the rules that are contained within the 2013 Regulations.
Schedule 1 to the 2013 Regulations sets out the rules of procedure that apply to all ET proceedings (“the ET Rules”).  By rule 1(1) “Employment Tribunal” is defined as meaning:
“an employment tribunal established in accordance with regulation 4, and in relation to any proceedings means the Tribunal responsible for the proceedings in question, whether performing administrative or judicial functions.”
By rule 8, provision is made for the presentation of a claim, stating that:
A claim shall be started by presenting a completed claim form (using a prescribed form) in accordance with any practice direction made under regulation 11 ...”
Rule 85 further provides:
A claim form may only be delivered in accordance with the practice direction made under regulation 11 which supplements rule 8.”
At the relevant time, for claims brought in England and Wales, by presidential practice direction it was duly provided that a claim form might be presented on-line, or by post to the ET central office in Leicester, or in person to one of the regional tribunal offices listed in the schedule.  There was (and is) no requirement that the claim was to be presented to any particular office based on the regional location of one or more of the parties.  Upon receiving a claim, rule 85 then provides:
The Tribunal shall notify the parties ... of the address of the tribunal office dealing with the case ... and all documents shall be delivered to either the postal or the electronic address so notified.  The Tribunal may from time to time notify the parties of any change of address, ...”
The ET Rules are silent as to how the allocation of a claim to a particular office will be determined.  The guidance provided on the www.gov.uk website states (under the sub-heading “Going to a tribunal hearing”) that:
“Cases are normally held at the employment tribunal office closest to where you worked. ...”
but this is not the subject of any rule and, as made clear by the case-law, there is no right to have a claim managed, or heard, in any particular office or region.
In Berrendero v Suffolk Area Health Authority UKEAT/0365/81 the claimant sought to challenge the refusal by the ET at Bury St Edmunds to transfer the case back to the London ET, where it was originally presented.  Dismissing the appeal, the EAT (Browne-Wilkinson P (as he then was) presiding) made clear that:
“... the power to fix the venue of a hearing is within the discretion of the regional chairman. ...”
stressing that the EAT:
“... will not interfere with the exercise by the regional chairman of his discretion, unless it is demonstrated that he has exercised his discretion in a way which no chairman, properly directed, could have done on the basis of the information before him.”
Similarly, in Faleye and anor v UK Mission Enterprise Ltd and ors UKEAT/0359/10, the EAT (Underhill P (as he then was) presiding) again emphasised the broad discretion afforded to the ET in determining where claims are to be located for case management and hearing purposes:
In any event, however, even if it were thought that the case for transferring the two London South cases to London Central was rather thin, the decision would have to give rise to a real risk of injustice before this Tribunal would intervene.  The practice whereby claims are required to be presented to a particular office by reference to the postcode of the claimant's place of work, and are thereafter managed and heard in that office, is no more than that - a practice.  It is not prescribed by the Employment Tribunal Rules, or any other statutory instrument.  It is not even, as I understand it, the subject of a formal Practice Direction.  It gives rise to no question of jurisdiction.  It follows that transfers between regions can be freely made for any reason that seems good to Regional Employment Judges, subject only to any question of the transfer giving rise to injustice.  Such injustice can sometimes arise when the prima facie correct tribunal office is remote from where one or both parties reside or are based.  But there is nothing of that kind here.  ...  Neither before the Tribunal nor before me has Mr Ogilvie [for the claimants] been able to identify any specific prejudice to the Appellants in having their case heard in Kingsway rather than in Croydon.  He seemed to think that there was some fundamental right in a claimant in the employment tribunal to have his or her case managed and determined in the tribunal region which covers his place of work, and that on that basis the appeal raised, as he put it in his skeleton argument, “a point of fundamental importance which affects tens of thousands of cases right across the country”.  With all respect to him, this is a nonsense.  There is no such right.”
In oral argument, Mr Kohanzad initially relied on this passage in Faleye to support his submission that issues of allocation to, and transfer between, ET offices were purely administrative acts, giving rise to no judicial decision requiring reasons to be provided by the ET.  Upon further reflection, however, he accepted that might not be an accurate characterisation of the position relating to the transfer of proceedings, noting, in particular, that the decision in Faleye took the form of a case management order made by the ET.
In any event, however, it is clear that the ET is afforded a broad discretion in its case management of proceedings, and by rule 29 ET Rules it is provided:
“The Tribunal may at any stage of the proceedings, on its own initiative or on application, make a case management order.  … the particular powers identified in the following rules do not restrict that general power. A case management order may vary, suspend or set aside an earlier case management order where that is necessary in the interests of justice, and in particular where a party affected by the earlier order did not have a reasonable opportunity to make representations before it was made.”
A “case management order” is defined under rule 1(3), as being:
“an order or decision of any kind in relation to the conduct of proceedings ...”
Where the ET makes a decision without a hearing, it is required to communicate that decision to the parties in writing, identifying the Employment Judge who has made it (rule 60).  As for the obligation upon the ET to give reasons, by rule 62 it is provided:
The Tribunal shall give reasons for its decision on any disputed issue, whether substantive or procedural (including any decision on an application for reconsideration ...).
In the case of a decision given in writing the reasons shall also be given in writing. ...
...
The reasons given for any decision shall be proportionate to the significance of the issue and for decisions other than judgments may be very short.
...”
More generally, in exercising its powers under the ET Rules, an ET (assisted by the parties) is required to seek to give effect to the overriding objective, as provided by rule 2:
“The overriding objective of these Rules is to enable Employment Tribunals to deal with cases fairly and justly. Dealing with a case fairly and justly includes, so far as practicable— (a) ensuring that the parties are on an equal footing; (b) dealing with cases in ways which are proportionate to the complexity and importance of the issues; (c) avoiding unnecessary formality and seeking flexibility in the proceedings; (d) avoiding delay, so far as compatible with proper consideration of the issues; and (e) saving expense.
A Tribunal shall seek to give effect to the overriding objective in interpreting, or exercising any power given to it by, these Rules. The parties and their representatives shall assist the Tribunal to further the overriding objective and in particular shall co- operate generally with each other and with the Tribunal.”
The claimant’s submissions
In his submissions, the claimant has focused on the account provided by REJ Foxwell (as set out in his letter of 8 June 2023), objecting that there were no orders, only “secret and private correspondences”; as such, these were only “personal decisions” made by REJ Foxwell, “not official orders”.  Relying on points made at the rule 3(10) hearing, the claimant complains that each of the decisions under appeal were local implementations of a general request made by REJ Foxwell to the REJs of the three London regions, but, in each case, his view was not sought prior to the decision to transfer, and the letters confirming the transfer did not identify the relevant decision-taker (contrary to rule 60 ET Rules) and (contrary to rule 62) did not provide reasons for that decision.  The claimant says that case management orders made without giving a party a reasonable opportunity to make representations must be capable of meaningful challenge; that was consistent with the rulings of the EAT in Berrendero and Faleye, and was in keeping with the open justice principle.  He further contends that the decision made by REJ Foxwell was unlawful and should be treated as void: he had been prejudiced because he had been unable to appeal against the decision as he did not know when it had been made, and similarly he was unable to apply for a reconsideration.
Resisting the arguments of Mr Kohanzad for Maid Solutions, the claimant submitted that a transfer from one ET region to another was different to the initial assignment of a case to a particular ET office.  He further contended that it was in the interests of justice that his claims were dealt with by different ET offices, not least as it would be difficult for one ET to deal with a large number of claims, and argued that the reasons for the original transfer decision, as set out in the letter of 19 January 2021, could not withstand scrutiny: the issue of double recovery did not arise at this early stage of the proceedings, and there was no requirement on a claimant to disclose the fact that he had made other claims when these had not been brought against the same employer.  Moreover, the claimant pointed out that the transfer decisions had led to the postponement of hearings and had caused delay in the proceedings, which would not be in the interests of justice as it would mean that witness memories would fade.
Subsequently replying to points made orally by Mr Kohanzad, the claimant said it was wrong to say that the letter of 19 January 2021 was not an order when it was clear that it was communicating a case management decision.  Standardly, when the ET sent out an order, this would be accompanied by a letter explaining rights of appeal and reconsideration; that was not done in this case.  This, the claimant says, had a real consequence for him: although Mr Kohanzad had argued that he ought to have applied for reconsideration, the letter of 19 January 2021 was not accompanied by guidance as to the right to make such an application, and the later letters confirming the various transfers did not identify the Judge, still less give reasons for the decision/s.  In any event, the claimant says that he did make applications for reconsideration but received no response (in this regard, the claimant produced the correspondence in the Hello Services case to which we have referred above, but said he had been prejudiced by not being put on notice of this point earlier (saying he would have put all the relevant documents before the EAT if this had been raised earlier)).
The position of the respondents
Addressing the objection that the letter of  23 March 2022 (confirming the transfer in Maid Solutions) had not given the name of the relevant Employment Judge (contrary to rule 60), Mr Kohanzad said that would depend on whether this was a “decision” of the ET.  Initially submitting that it should not be seen as a case management order but merely an administrative function (akin to the initial allocation of a case to a region), Mr Kohanzad said that even if that was not correct, then the letter of 19 January 2021 should be seen as communicating the case management decision in issue, with the subsequent letter (as the claimant would have understood) being merely the administrative execution of that decision.  As for any failure to give reasons: (1) initially there was no reason to consider that the claimant should take issue with the transfers, so, as there was no dispute, rule 65 was not engaged; (2) in any event, the letter of 19 January 2021 did provide the reasons.
Turning to what were said to be the consequences of the transfer decision(s) for the claimant, Mr Kohanzad said that, to the extent that any transfer of proceedings might give rise to a real injustice, it would be open to the party concerned to apply for a reconsideration; that was the course that ought to have been adopted by the claimant in these cases.  Otherwise, the ET ought to be able to get on with the progression of the claims before it, addressing objections as and when they were raised by the parties.  The letter confirming the transfer of the proceedings could be seen as akin to the provision of a formal judgment, such that the parties could, if considered necessary, then ask for written reasons and/or could apply for the ET to reconsider the underlying decision.
Ms Petrovic (for Chalcot House) and Mr Okcu (in the Cafe on the Hill case) did not seek to make any separate submissions.
Analysis and conclusions
In addressing the points raised by these appeals, the starting point has to be to identify the decision (or decisions) under challenge.  In each case, the claimant’s appeal is against the letter sent out to him confirming the transfer of his claim to the ET Watford office.  It is apparent, however, that in each instance, the transfer implemented a decision taken in the early part of January 2021, when the REJs for the three London regions and for the South East region agreed that similar claims issued by the claimant in those regions would all be case managed together at the ET Watford office.  That decision had been communicated to the claimant, in the letter from REJ Foxwell of 19 January 2021.  Although that letter was specifically addressed to the claimant’s claims “currently proceeding in the London East, London Central and London South Regions”, it is clear that the subsequent transfers of other claims (including each of the nine that are the subject of these appeals, albeit, as at 19 January 2021, only three of them had been issued) followed this earlier decision and were made for the same reasons.
In seeking to resist the claimant’s appeal, Mr Kohanzad initially submitted that the transfers were to be viewed in the same way as the initial “fixing of a claim”, which was an “administrative decision” and, save where a transfer was made as a result of specific application, did not require the giving of any reasons.  Without wishing to over-complicate matters, we are, however, not convinced that the position is quite so straightforward.
We can accept that the initial allocation of a claim to a particular ET office is likely to be a purely administrative action, no doubt following the convention (albeit this is not the subject of any presidential direction, still less any provision under the ET Rules) that claims will be allocated by reference to the postcode of the claimant’s place (or former place) of work.  The location of ET offices, and the way in which work is allocated to particular locations, is a matter within the very wide discretion afforded to the ET President (which may be delegated to REJs) under regulation 7 of the 2013 Regulations.  Plainly, however, the particular allocation of an individual claim will require no decision on the part of the ET President (or any REJ); unless and until an issue arises in relation to the proceedings in question, this will be a purely administrative function that will not engage the provisions of rules 60 and 62.  Indeed, as rule 85 ET Rules makes clear, the only requirement is that the ET notify the parties of the address of the office that will be dealing with the case (and of any change in that address); there is no suggestion that this involves a judicial decision that will engage the requirements of rules 60 or 62.
We can also see that there may be instances where the transfer of a case from one office to another is similarly a purely administrative function; that would no doubt be the case, for instance, if an office had to be closed and its case-load transferred.  Where, however, the transfer results from some active judicial intervention, then we consider that is a case management decision which should thus be communicated in writing to the parties (assuming the decision to have been made without a hearing), identifying the Judge who made it (per rule 60).  In the claim brought against Wolf Data Systems, that was done.  Although the claimant appeals against the subsequent letter (of 19 July 2021), confirming the transfer, it is apparent that the decision made by REJ Wade was communicated to him in writing on 15 July 2021, not only identifying the relevant decision-taker but also providing the reasons for that decision.  Similarly, in relation to the claim against Murat Tchoukour, the letter informing the claimant of the transfer also identified the relevant decision-taker (“as directed by Judge Balogun”), albeit it did not set out any explanation of the reasons for the decision.  In the other cases before us, however, we have not seen any letter identifying the Judge who made the transfer decision.  The question is whether that amounts to an error of law.  Additionally, save in the Wolf Data Systems case, was it wrong for the communications to the claimant to merely state the fact of the transfer without providing reasons?
In answering these questions, we consider the communications sent to the claimant have to be seen in context.  It is, therefore, relevant that the claimant had already received REJ Foxwell’s letter of 19 January 2021 and was aware that the decision had been taken (identifying REJ Foxwell as the relevant decision-taker) that his claims in the London and the South East regions should be dealt with together at the ET office at Watford.  The reasons for that decision had been explained and, on one view, the information required under the ET Rules had thus been provided.  Having regard to the overriding objective, and the need to try to avoid unnecessary formality, we can see that it might be thought that this should be sufficient.  On the other hand, however, it is also relevant to note that, other than the specific cases referenced in the letter of 19 January 2021 (not any of the cases now before us), other parties to the proceedings in question would not have known who had made the decision to transfer the case and would not have been aware of the reasons for that decision.  Moreover, as REJ Foxwell’s letter to the EAT (of 8 June 2023) makes clear, claims that post-dated the discussion on 4 January 2021 were subsequently transferred without prior consultation with him, such that he could not properly be described as the relevant decision-taker in each of those cases.  Other than in the cases involving Wolf Data Systems and Murat Tchoukour, we therefore agree with the claimant that it was wrong that the letters sent out confirming the transfer did not identify the name of the Judge who had made this direction.  Moreover, other than the claim brought against Wolf Data Systems, it was wrong that no explanation was provided for the transfer decision, albeit (pursuant to rule 62(4)) need only have been very short.
Although we thus consider the claimant has identified errors on the part of the ETs in these cases, it is hard to see that any injustice arises.  As we have observed, the claimant was in fact well aware of the decision that underpinned each of these transfers: the letter of 19 January 2021 had clearly explained to him why his claims in London and the South East were being combined for case management purposes and had told him who had made this decision.  Although the respondents to the claims in question did not have the same advantage, we are not aware that any of those concerned ever raised an objection.  As the EAT made clear in Faleye (see paragraph 19 of that judgment), even if some injustice arose in the way the matter was handled by the ET, if no substantive injustice can be said to arise from the actual decision to transfer the proceedings it will be entirely appropriate for the EAT to exercise its powers under section 35 of the Employment Tribunals Act 1996 to simply re-make the transfer order, rectifying the earlier error/s.
The claimant contends, however, that he has suffered a real injustice as a result of the errors made by the ET.  Under his first ground of appeal, he also complains that he ought to have been given a reasonable opportunity to make representations before each of the transfer decisions was made and that, in each case, a reference ought to have been made to the order from the Watford ET requesting the transfer.  In his oral argument, he has said that the failure to identify the decision-maker and to provide reasons for each of the transfer decisions meant that he was unable to properly appeal or to seek a reconsideration of those decisions. Moreover, by the second ground of appeal, the claimant says that he has suffered injustice as the transfers disrupted the progress of his claims, leading to hearings being postponed and to the proceedings being delayed; he has also complained that the combination of the proceedings might lead to his confidential information being disclosed.
We can deal shortly with the complaint that the transfer decision did not, in each instance, refer back to an order made by the Watford ET.  As we have already observed, the claimant was aware of the original decision made by REJ Foxwell, as explained in the letter of 19 January 2021.  Although we agree that the subsequent transfer letters ought properly to have provided brief reasons for the decision made in that case (which might well have simply involved attaching a copy of the 19 January 2021 letter), it cannot properly be said that the claimant suffered any prejudice in this regard.
We equally do not consider there is anything in the claimant’s complaint that he was unable to pursue an appeal or an application for reconsideration because of any failure by the ET to identify the decision-taker or to provide reasons for the transfer decisions in issue.  As a matter of fact, the claimant has pursued appeals against each of these decisions.  It is also apparent that he sought a reconsideration of the transfer decision in the Wolf Data Systems case, and we have seen correspondence in which he similarly made a request that the transfer in the Hello Services claim be revoked.  Indeed, at the hearing before us, the claimant emphasised that he had made a number of reconsideration applications, albeit he did not have all the relevant documentation available, as (he argued) he had not had proper forewarning that this might be an issue on his appeals.  We do not accept that the claimant can reasonably say he was unaware that the question whether he had applied for reconsideration of the transfer decisions might be a relevant issue at this hearing: Judge Stout’s directions in EA-2023-000834-AT (relating to the proceedings involving Cafe on the Hill) had made clear that it was.   In any event, however, it is plain that the claimant was well aware that he was able to apply for the decisions to be varied or revoked and, notwithstanding any errors on the part of the ET, had sought to do so in at least two of the cases before us.
As for whether any error of law arose from the fact that the claimant was not afforded the opportunity to make representations in advance, we note that these were decisions made as part of the ET’s case management of the proceedings.  As rule 29 ET Rules makes clear, this provides the ET with a very broad discretion in how it manages the claims before it, expressly allowing that such decisions may be made without affording the parties concerned a prior opportunity to make representations, providing that, in such cases, the ET may then vary, suspend or set aside its earlier order where that is necessary in the interests of justice.  Thus, as Judge Stout pointed out, to the extent that he considered it to be in the interests of justice, the course the claimant ought to have adopted was to apply to the ET for the transfer decision in issue to be set aside.
It is, of course, the claimant’s case that he did ask the ETs for the transfers to be revoked; he complains that he did not receive responses to his emails.  As this was a point advanced for the first time at the hearing before us, and without all the relevant documentation being available, it is not possible for us to be certain as to what happened in each of the cases before us and we have, therefore, decided to proceed on the basis that the claimant may well have made applications for the ET/s to re-visit these transfer decisions and that he did not receive a response.  Adopting this course, we have therefore considered the matters raised by the claimant under his second ground of appeal, in support of his argument that the transfers have given rise to a substantive injustice.
Approaching this question, we note that it is clear that a claimant has no right to choose where their ET claim is to be heard.  Other than distinguishing between claims in England and Wales, on the one hand, and in Scotland, on the other, the 2013 Regulations do not specify that ETs are to be located in any particular place, and, by regulation 7, the President is afforded a very wide discretion (which may be delegated to the REJs) to determine where ETs are to sit, and how work is to be allocated between them.  The requirements for the presentation of a claim make no reference to the location of the parties, and the ET Rules (and the relevant presidential direction) are silent as to how cases are to be allocated once received.  Where a decision is subsequently made for a case to be transferred, save that regulation 7 makes clear that this will either need to be a decision of the President or the relevant REJs, this can be freely done for any reason subject only to any question of the transfer giving rise to injustice (per Faleye at paragraph 15; and see Berrendero).
In the present case, where the transfer decisions meant that hearings had to be postponed, we can see that this might have been a relevant factor.  Equally, the transfer of proceedings to Watford might have given rise to some inconvenience for the parties in terms of travelling to the ET (although, we note that none of the respondents seems to have objected, and this is not a point that the claimant has identified or could reasonably complain about given that a number of his claims had been allocated to the Watford ET without him raising any concern).  It is less clear to us that case managing a larger number of claims should otherwise give rise to particular delays, or additional costs; on the contrary, given that the claimant’s claims are put on almost identical bases, there would seem to be an obvious saving in time and costs if these were case managed together.  As for the question of the claimant’s confidential information, we are unable to see that this could give rise to a legitimate concern.  No orders have been made anonymising any information in any of these cases, and we cannot see any basis on which such a derogation from the open justice principle could properly be made.  On the other hand, however, compelling reasons have been provided for transferring all the claims made in the London regions to the Watford office, to be combined for case management purposes with claims in the South East region.  As REJ Foxwell explained in his letter of 19 January 2021:
each claim involves similar facts;
the claimant in each case gives the same PO Box address but the claimant’s name given in the claim forms differs between Mr Ramos or Mr Garcia; the Tribunal must consider whether this is just one person and, if so, why he uses different names in different claims;
Mr Garcia made a similar claim in case 3318988/2019 (Garcia v The Gift Corner 3 Wishes Limited) which was dismissed and in which adverse findings were made about his credibility and the genuineness of the claim;
the claimant in the current claims makes no reference to the other current ones despite their relevance due to the obvious risk of double-recovery were he to succeed in more than one of them;
while it will be a matter for the judge hearing the case to decide, the above factors suggest that these claims are not based on genuine job applications and should therefore be struck out as an abuse of process or, alternatively, made the subject of a deposit order because they stand little prospect of success. Such orders cannot be made without a hearing.
The Tribunal has made these orders of its own motion because it is unlikely that the individual respondents will be aware of one another, of the similarities between their cases and/or the link between Mr Garcia and Mr Ramos.”
Notwithstanding the earlier dismissal of his grounds of appeal in these further respects (and our ruling on the application to reinstate those grounds), in his arguments before us the claimant has again repeated his complaints that the transfer of the proceedings to be case managed together by the Watford ET will mean he will be victimised for having previously made a complaint about an Employment Judge in that region.  There is, however, no basis for such an assertion.  The reason why REJ Foxwell determined that these claims should be case managed together is because that would best serve the overriding objective, dealing with these cases fairly and justly by ensuring all parties are on an equal footing (with the respondents thus being aware of the other claims brought), that the proceedings are dealt with in a proportionate way, and avoiding the expense and delays that would occur in the claims being considered across a number of ET offices.
Notwithstanding the errors that we have identified in relation to the failure to identify the relevant decision-taker (in all but two of the cases before us) or to provide reasons for the decision (in all but one of the cases), we are clear that no injustice arises from the transfer decisions in these cases.
Disposal
Given the failure to identify the relevant decision-taker and/or to provide reasons for the decision in all but the claim against Wolf Data Systems, we formally allow the claimant’s appeals in EA-2021-001131-AT; EA-2022-000639-AT; EA-2022-000642-AT; EA-2022-000645-AT; EA-2022-001155-AT; EA-2022-001484-AT; EA-2023-000357-AT; EA-2023-000834-AT.  We are, however, satisfied that no injustice arose from the transfer decisions, and, applying the overriding objective, that there can be only one answer in each of these cases, which is that dealing with the proceedings fairly and justly requires that the claims be transferred to the Watford office of the ET.  In these circumstances (having regard to the guidance of the Court of Appeal in Jafri v Lincoln College [2014] EWCA Civ 449, [2014] ICR 920), we are clear that the errors identified can have no material effect on the result and that it is appropriate to exercise our powers under section 35 Employment Tribunals Act 1996, to duly exercise the powers of the ET and confirm each of the transfer decisions made, for the reasons provided in REJ Foxwell’s letter of 19 January 2021.
No errors arose in relation to the proceedings involving Wolf Data Systems, and the appeal in that case is duly dismissed.

.............................
JOANNE WICKS KC sitting as a Deputy Judge of the High Court:
Introduction
This is my judgment on a number of applications concerned with issues of service and jurisdiction, namely:
an application by the Second Defendant (“Mr Hofgren”) for a declaration that the Claimant failed to serve the claim form on him in accordance with CPR Part 6 within the period required by CPR 7.5 and therefore that the court has no jurisdiction to try the claim against him;
an application by the Fourth Defendant (“Mr Ahmad”) seeking to set aside an order of Master Pester dated 11 October 2023 giving permission for service on Mr Ahmad out of the jurisdiction and by alternative means, on the grounds (a) that the claim against him does not have a reasonable prospect of success; (b) that England and Wales is not the proper place in which to bring the claim; (c) that there were neither exceptional circumstances nor good reason to grant permission for service by alternative means; and (d) the Claimant failed to make full and frank disclosure to Master Pester;
an application by Mr Hofgren, Mr Ahmad and the Third Defendant (“Mr Cheek”) (to whom I shall refer together as “the Individual Defendants”) pursuant to CPR 11(1)(b) for an order that the court should not exercise its jurisdiction and for a stay of the claim against them on the grounds that the courts of the Bailiwick of Guernsey are a more appropriate forum (“the Appropriate Forum Application”); and
an application by the First Defendant (“D1”) that, in the event that the court decides that it should not exercise jurisdiction against the Individual Defendants, the court should also grant a stay pursuant to CPR 11(1)(b) in respect of the claims against D1 (“D1’s Application”).
The Claimant is a Guernsey non-cellular company incorporated on 10 March 2017. It is beneficially owned by GFG Funds PCC Limited (“GFG PCC”), a Guernsey protected cell company which was authorised by the Guernsey Financial Services Commission (“GFSC”) as an open-ended collective investment scheme. Under Guernsey law, a protected cell company is a single legal entity, comprising a core with core assets and cells with cell assets, such assets being ring-fenced both within the protected cell company and as against third party creditors of that company. The Claimant was the special purpose vehicle through which one of GFG PCC’s cells, Xenfin Securities Debt Fund 1 Cell (“Xenfin Cell”), made investments.
D1 is a Guernsey non-cellular company licensed and regulated by the Guernsey Financial Services Commission (“GFSC”). The Claimant contends that D1 acted as the Claimant’s investment manager.
The Claimant, D1 and GFG PCC are all now in liquidation.
Mr Hofgren and Mr Cheek were directors of the Claimant and GFG PCC and the ultimate beneficial owners of D1. Mr Hofgren was also a director of D1.
The Claimant alleges that Mr Ahmad was a de facto director of the Claimant.
The Claimant’s case is that D1 owed it contractual duties to act in the Claimant’s best interest and with reasonable care, skill and diligence in managing the Claimant’s investments; that the relationship between the Claimant and D1 was one of trust and confidence such that D1 owed the Claimant a fiduciary duty to avoid conflicts of interest and that D1 owed the Claimant a duty in tort to exercise reasonable care, skill and diligence in managing the Claimant’s investments. There is a potential dispute as to whether the relationship between the Claimant and D1 is governed by English or Guernsey law, as I shall explain in more detail below.
The Claimant’s pleaded case is that Mr Hofgren and Mr Cheek, as directors of the Claimant, and Mr Ahmad as a de facto director of the Claimant, owed it duties under Guernsey law to act in what they honestly believed to be in the Claimant’s best interests, to avoid conflicts of interest and to exercise reasonable care, diligence and skill.
The Claimant contends that the Defendants acted in breach of these obligations (a) in causing the Claimant to enter into a loan of £9.55m to Dolphin Capital 158 Projekt GmbH & Co KG on 11 May 2017 (“the DC158 Loan”); (b) in causing the Claimant to enter into a loan of £3.2m to 7.EP Projekt GmbH Co. KG on 10 May 2018 (“the 7EP Loan”) (the DC158 and 7EP Loans being together “the Loans”); (c) in the conversion of the Claimant’s security under the Loans into shares in Vordere Limited (“Vordere”) in June 2019 (“the Vordere Transaction”); and (d) in causing payments to be made to two companies associated with Mr Ahmad, Aurora Capital Limited and Core Properties Limited.
For the purposes of these applications, it was common ground between the Claimant and the Individual Defendants that the relevant Guernsey limitation periods (applicable to the claims by virtue of the Foreign Limitation Periods Act 1984) should be taken to be six years. This is on the basis that, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, foreign law should be presumed to be the same as English law: Brownlie v FS Cairo (Nile Plaza) LLC [2021] UKSC 45, [2022] AC 995 and that, under English law, the limitation period for claims of breach of duty against directors, except in cases involving a misapplication of pre-existing corporate assets or fraud, is six years: Davies v Ford [2020] EWHC 686 (Ch) at [319]. Consequently, I approach these applications on the basis that the limitation period for the claims against the Individual Defendants in respect of the DC158 Loan and 7EP Loan expired on 11 May 2023 and 10 February 2024 respectively.
Mr Hofgren’s service application
The claim form in these proceedings was issued on 5 May 2023, shortly before the expiry of the limitation periods referred to above. Under CPR 7.5, it was valid for service until 5 September 2023. The claim form was amended on 29 August 2023.
Under CPR 6.9(2), the claim form was required to be served on Mr Hofgren at his “usual or last known residence”. “Last known” refers to the serving party’s actual knowledge, or knowledge that he could have acquired exercising reasonable diligence: Collier v Williams [2006] EWCA Civ 20, [2006] 1 WLR 1945 at [71]. By CPR 6.9(3), if the Claimant had reason to believe that the address was one at which Mr Hofgren no longer resided, it was obliged to take reasonable steps to ascertain the address of his current residence. By CPR 6.9(6), a claimant may serve the claim form on a defendant’s usual or last known residence where it cannot ascertain the defendant’s current residence and cannot ascertain an alternative place or alternative method by which service may be effected.
The Claimant contends that service was effected upon Mr Hofgren, in accordance with CPR 6.9, by sending the amended claim form by first class post on 30 August 2023 to Flat 4, 28 Cleveland Square, London W2 6DD, that being Mr Hofgren’s “last known residence”. Mr Hofgren disputes that as good service, on the basis that (a) the letter sending the Claim Form was not “properly addressed” within the meaning of section 7 of the Interpretation Act 1978, because the address contained a mistake: the package was addressed to “Flat 4, 28 Cleveland Square, Thomas More Street, London W2 6DD”. Thomas More Street is a road in East London, rather than Paddington, which is where 28 Cleveland Square is; and (b) 28 Cleveland Square was not Mr Hofgren’s “last known residence” because the Claimant could, with reasonable diligence, have found a more recent residence, namely 42 Kyrle Road, London SW11 8BA. It is not suggested that there was any alternative method by which Mr Hofgren could have been served, he having chosen (in response to the Claimant’s request) not to instruct his solicitors to accept service on his behalf.
Mr Hofgren’s evidence as to where he in fact lived from time to time is set out at paragraphs 7-10 of his witness statement dated 27 September 2023. He had lived with his ex-wife at 28 Cleveland Square until February 2020, following which it had been rented out. The Kyrle Road address was the house of a friend for whom Mr Hofgren had been house-sitting between 15 November 2022 and 27 July 2023. At the time of his witness statement (and when the claim form was served), Mr Hofgren says he had no permanent residence.
The Claimant’s evidence as to what steps it took to ascertain Mr Hofgren’s address for service is set out in paragraphs 12-18 of the second witness statement of Thomas Edward Clark dated 1 May 2024 (“Clark 2”).
Mr Phillips, for Mr Hofgren, took me to authorities warning claimants of the dangers of waiting until the last moment to serve proceedings: Anderton v Clwyd Council Council (No 2) [2002] EWCA Civ 933, [2002] 1 WLR 3174 at [2], [3]; Barton v Wright Hassall LLP [2020] UKSC 12, [2020] 1 WLR 1119 at [22], [23]; R (Good Law Project) v Secretary of State for Health and Social Care [2022] EWCA Civ 355, [2022] 1 WLR 2339 at [41], [83]. He also relied on White v Weston [1968] 2 QB 647 at 661-662 for the proposition that a prospective defendant is under no obligation to inform the prospective claimant of any change in his address.
Mr Phillips also submitted that it would have been open to the Claimant to have effected service on Mr Hofgren in other ways, including by reliance on section 1140 of the Companies Act 2006. However, I agree with Mr Brown for the Claimant that the existence of alternative methods of service does not take the matter much further. What I have to decide is whether service was properly effected via the method the Claimant chose to use.
I deal first with the issue as to whether the package containing the claim form was “properly addressed”. Mr Phillips contends that, by sections 21 and 23(1) of the Interpretation Act 1978, section 7 of that Act applies to service under the CPR. This provides:
“Where an Act authorises or requires any document to be served by post (whether the expression “serve” or the expression “give” or “send” or any other expression is used) then, unless the contrary intention appears, the service is deemed to be effected by properly addressing, pre-paying and posting a letter containing the document and, unless the contrary is proved, to have been effected at the time at which the letter would be delivered in the ordinary course of post.”
I am myself doubtful whether section 7 applies to service under the CPR. The CPR have their own regime for service: CPR 7.5(1) sets out the steps which must be completed by midnight on the calendar day four months after the date of issue of the claim form. Where the method of service is first class post, document exchange or other service which provides for delivery on the next business day, the relevant step is “posting, leaving with, delivering to or collection by the relevant service provider”. CPR 6.14 deems service of a claim form served within the United Kingdom in accordance with CPR Part 6 to take place on the second business day after completion of the relevant step in CPR 7.5(1). These provisions may be said to sufficiently cover the field to constitute a “contrary intention” for the purpose of section 7. However, Mr Brown was content to accept that the requirement in section 7 that the letter be “properly addressed, pre-paid and posted” applies to the service of claim forms. Moreover, it seems to me that even absent any application of section 7, there must be some implication, in the reference to “posting” in CPR 7.5(1), that what is posted bears the appropriate address.
In my judgment, the package containing the claim form was “properly addressed” for the purpose of section 7 of the Interpretation Act 1978 or any such implication in CPR 7.5(1). A letter or package may be “properly addressed”, even though it contains an error, if the error would not have been likely to affect the place to which Royal Mail would deliver it. In this case, the flat number, the house number and street and the postcode were all correct. Royal Mail will have ignored the reference to a street which was not in that postcode. Indeed, the Claimant’s evidence is that the Post Office generates a delivery sticker using only the flat number and the postcode. That the addition of the reference to Thomas More Street made no difference is evidenced by the fact that Royal Mail twice attempted delivery to the correct address in Cleveland Square: it was unable to deliver the package because it was “not called for” (i.e. not collected following attempted delivery), rather than because there was no such address.
I turn then to the question whether Cleveland Square was Mr Hofgren’s “last known residence” or whether, as he contends, the Claimant could with reasonable diligence have discovered that he had lived more recently at the Kyrle Road address. Having considered the evidence on both sides, I am satisfied that the Claimant’s solicitors took all reasonable steps to identify Mr Hofgren’s residence. Their enquiries indicated that Mr Hofgren lived at 28 Cleveland Square with his wife and her son; the Claimant did not know that Mr Hofgren had been divorced until he served his evidence for these applications and there is nothing to suggest that they could have found out about the divorce any earlier. Property records indicated that 28 Cleveland Square was owned by Mr Hofgren’s wife. The Claimant’s solicitors reviewed emails, diary entries, Uber receipts and KYC documents which repeatedly referred to 28 Cleveland Square as Mr Hofgren’s residence. Moreover, proceedings commenced against Mr Hofgren by Vordere in December 2021 gave Cleveland Square as his address on the claim form. The Claimant found that there was an association between Mr Hofgren and his wife with a residence in Wiltshire, which the Claimant reasonably understood to be a second home, but in any event Mr Hofgren does not argue that service should have been effected at the Wiltshire address.
Mr Hofgren contends that the Claimant should have realised that the Kyrle Road address was more recent than the Cleveland Square address because a search at Companies House would have revealed it as a correspondence address for RW Capital Limited, of which Mr Hofgren was appointed director in July 2023 and a Google Maps search would have shown that to be a residential property. Mr Brown submits that Kyrle Road was not even a “residence”, since Mr Hofgren’s evidence is that he was only house-sitting for a friend there. I do not accept this latter submission, since Mr Hofgren was living at Kyrle Road in a settled way for a number of months, sufficient to constitute that property his “residence” for the purposes of service. However, I agree with Mr Brown’s submission that a Companies House search is intended to show corporate correspondence addresses, not a residential address for Mr Hofgren. Given that a search would have revealed that Mr Hofgren had eight different appointments, each giving a different correspondence address, there was no reason for the Claimant to conclude that he was living at Kyrle Road rather than Cleveland Square. Since he was occupying only as licensee, a search at HM Land Registry would not have shown any connection between Mr Hofgren and the property.
Mr Phillips also submits that the Claimant could have asked Mr Hofgren for his address, as it did Mr Cheek. I do not consider that there is any force in this argument. The Claimant had sent letters before action to Mr Cheek and Mr Hofgren in April 2023 both by post and email. The letter to Mr Hofgren used the Cleveland Square address. Mr Hofgren had responded acknowledging receipt of the email, but did not say that he no longer lived at the Cleveland Square address. In contrast Mr Cheek had said that there had been a delay in him receiving the letter before action because the Claimant had used an old physical address and a defunct email address. Mr Cheek’s solicitors were therefore asked in August 2023 to provide an up-to-date address for him, but the same request was not made of Mr Hofgren. This was because the correspondence with Mr Hofgren gave the Claimant no reason to think that he was not still living at Cleveland Square. In any event, I cannot see how it can be said that enquiries of Mr Hofgren would be likely to have revealed the Kyrle Road address, since by August 2023, Mr Hofgren was no longer living at Kyrle Road and, indeed, his position appears to be that he did not have any residence at which service could be made at that time.
I therefore conclude that service of the claim form was properly effected on Mr Hofgren in accordance with the CPR.
Mr Ahmad’s application
By an application notice dated 9 October 2023, the Claimant applied without notice for permission to serve the proceedings on Mr Ahmad out of the jurisdiction and for permission to serve Mr Ahmad by alternative means, namely by SMS, WhatsApp or similar means to a stated telephone number and by email to a stated email address. That application was granted by Master Pester’s order of 11 October 2023. Mr Ahmad applies to set aside Master Pester’s order (in so far as it relates to him).
On an application for permission to serve out of the jurisdiction, a claimant must establish (1) a good arguable case that the claims fall within one of the gateways in CPR PD 6B, paragraph 3.1; (2) a serious issue to be tried on the merits; and (3) that England is the appropriate forum for trial and the court ought to exercise its discretion to permit service out of the jurisdiction: FS Cairo (Nile Plaza) LLC v Brownlie, above, at [25]. Mr Ahmad challenges the existence of the second and third conditions. The third condition, appropriate forum, overlaps with the Appropriate Forum Application and D1’s Application and I shall address it in that context below, albeit recognising that if England is not the appropriate forum, that is a ground for setting aside the order for permission to serve out and not merely a ground for a stay of proceedings.
As regards the application for service by an alternative method, Mr Ahmad is resident in the United Arab Emirates, with whom the United Kingdom has entered into a treaty on Judicial Assistance in Civil and Commercial Matters dated 7 December 2006 (“the Treaty”). This allows for requests for service to be made by the Senior Master of the King’s Bench Division, transmitted through diplomatic channels to the UAE, which will effect service.  In Cesfin Ventures LLC v Al Ghaith Al Qubaisi [2021] EWHC 3311 Master Kaye held that the Treaty does not preclude service by alternative means. She noted a debate in the authorities as to whether it was necessary to find special or exceptional circumstances to justify an order for alternative service or whether there simply needs to be a good reason to permit service by alternative means, saying at [30]:
“It seems to me that when one considers the authorities in the round, including the decision in Abela v Baadarani [2013] UKSC 44, that when the Treaty does not make service by the Diplomatic Channels exclusive the court may not need to go as far as exceptional circumstances even if the appropriate test is exceptional circumstances rather than good reason.”
In Caterpillar Financial Services (Dubai) Limited v National Gulf Construction LLC [2022] EWHC 914 (Comm) Miss Julia Dias, sitting as a Deputy High Court Judge, treated Cesfin as establishing that it was not necessary to show exceptional circumstances, although I do not read Master Kaye’s judgment as quite that unequivocal, not least since she decided that there were, in fact in that case, exceptional circumstances (see [33]). In any event, Mr Ahmad seeks to set aside Master Pester’s order on the basis that there were no good reasons (let alone exceptional circumstances) for departure from the Treaty’s methods of service.
On any application made without notice, the applicant owes a duty to give full and frank disclosure of all matters relevant to the application, including all matters of fact or law adverse to the applicant. In 4VVV Ltd v Spence [2023] EWHC 1 (Comm) at [90], HHJ Pelling KC, sitting as a judge of the High Court summarised the principles as follows:
“the duty of the applicant is to make a full and fair disclosure of all the facts which it is objectively material for the judge to know in dealing with the application as made: materiality is to be decided by the court and not by the assessment of the applicant or his legal advisers; the duty is a strict one and includes not merely material facts known to the applicant but also additional facts which he would have known if he had made proper enquiries—see Konamaneni v Rolls Royce Industrial Power (India) Ltd [2002] 1 WLR 1269, per Lawrence Collins J as he then was at [180]. Material facts are those which a judge would need or want to take into account in deciding whether to make the order sought—see Alliance Bank JSC v Zhunus [2015] EWHC 714 (Comm) per Cooke J at [65] and National Bank Trust v Yurov [2016] EWHC 1913 per Males J as he then was [18(a)]. However, there are limits to this and there is no obligation to disclose points there is no reason to anticipate that the other side would raise if present and more generally, the principle should not be carried to extreme lengths in the hope of obtaining the discharge of injunctions in cases where there is little hope of doing so on the substantial merits of the case—see Brink’s Mat Ltd v Elcombe [1988] 1 WLR 1350 per Slade LJ at 1359B-E…The ultimate touchstone is whether the presentation to the judge was fair in all material respects—see Federal Republic of Nigeria v Royal Dutch Shell Plc [2020] EWHC 1315 (Comm) per Butcher J at [90].”
Mr Ahmad contends that the Claimant failed to give sufficient disclosure of various points in his favour and for that reason, too, the Master’s order should be set aside.
Serious issue to be tried on the merits
The requirement to show a “serious issue to be tried on the merits” requires the applicant for permission to serve out of the jurisdiction to show that its claim has a reasonable prospect of success. The test is essentially the same as that for resisting summary judgment, the well-known principles for which were set out in Easyair Ltd v Opal Telecom Ltd [2009] EWHC 339 (Ch) at [15]. In Lungowe v Vedanta Resources Plc [2019] UKSC 20, [2020] AC 1045 at [9]-[11] and Okpabi v Royal Dutch Shell Plc [2021] UKSC 3, [2021] 1 WLR 1294 at [20]-[23], the Supreme Court has warned about the importance of observing proportionality in determining the question as to whether there are reasonable prospects of success (and other issues) in the context of a jurisdiction dispute. Judicial restraint, and the need to avoid a mini-trial, are vital. In Okpabi, Lord Hamblen JSC said at [22]:
“Where, as will often be the case where permission for service out of the jurisdiction is sought, there are particulars of claim, the analytical focus should be on the particulars of claim and whether, on the basis that the facts there alleged are true, the cause of action asserted has a real prospect of success. Any particulars of claim or witness statement setting out details of the claim will be supported by a statement of truth. Save in cases where allegations of fact are demonstrably untrue or unsupportable, it is generally not appropriate for a defendant to dispute the facts alleged through evidence of its own. Doing so may well just show that there is a triable issue.”
I commend Mr Phillips for heeding the Supreme Court’s guidance and properly concentrating his fire, in respect of this issue, on the case which is pleaded against Mr Ahmad. The complaint is that paragraphs 16 and 17 of the Particulars of Claim, where the facts on which the Claimant relies for the contention that Mr Ahmad was a de facto director are set out, fail to plead a proper case that Mr Ahmad undertook functions that can only be discharged by a director. Whilst the Claimant has adduced a substantial volume of evidence to support its case on this issue (Clark 2 at paragraphs 93-189), the evidence adduced by Mr Ahmad is confined to two witness statements from his solicitors. A statement from Roland James Ellis essentially sets out the submissions about the effect of the pleadings and documents which Mr Phillips has elaborated at the hearing. A statement from John Francis Bechelet produces various agreements under which Mr Ahmad’s companies were appointed to be an adviser and states Mr Ahmad’s denials of any activity which would constitute him a de facto director.
Mr Phillips referred me to the law on de facto directors in England and Guernsey as set out by Her Honour Hazel Marshall QC, Lieutenant Bailiff of Guernsey, in Carlyle Capital Corporation Limited (in liquidation) v Conway, judgment of the Royal Court of Guernsey 38/2017 and by Millett J in Re Hydrodan (Corby) Limited [1994] 2 BCLC 180. In the words of Millett J,
“To establish that a person was a de facto director of a company it is necessary to plead and prove that he undertook functions in relation to the company which can properly be discharged only by a director. It is not sufficient to show that he was concerned in the management of the company’s affairs or undertook tasks in relation to its business which can properly be performed by a manager below board level.”
Mr Phillips laid emphasis on the need for a claimant to “plead and prove” that the defendant was undertaking directorial functions, which language is also picked up in the judgments of Lords Walker and Clarke in Revenue and Customs Commissioners v Holland [2010] UKSC 51, [2010] 1 WLR 2793 at [111] and [128] respectively. However, I note that the ratio of that decision, which concerned alleged breach of duty by causing the payment of dividends without making provision for liabilities, is given in the judgment of Lord Collins (see Smithton Ltd (formerly Hobart Capital Markets Ltd) v Naggar [2014] EWCA Civ 939, [2015] 1 WLR 189 at [26]). At [93] Lord Collins said:
“It does not follow that “de facto director” must be given the same meaning in all of the different contexts in which a “director” may be liable. It seems to me that in the present context of the fiduciary duty of a director not to dispose wrongfully of the company's assets, the crucial question is whether the person assumed the duties of a director. Both Sir Nicolas Browne-Wilkinson V-C in In re Lo-Line Electric Motors Ltd [1988] Ch 477, 490, and Millett J in In re Hydrodam [1994] 2 BCLC 180, 183, referred to the assumption of office as a mark of a de facto director. In Fayers Legal Services Ltd v Day (unreported) 11 April 2001, a case relating to breach of fiduciary duty, Patten J, rejecting a claim that the defendant was a de facto director of the company and had been in breach of fiduciary duty, said that in order to make him liable for misfeasance as a de facto director the person must be part of the corporate governing structure, and the claimants had to prove that he assumed a role in the company sufficient to impose on him a fiduciary duty to the company and to make him responsible for the misuse of its assets. It seems to me that that is the correct formulation in a case of the present kind. See also Primlake Ltd v Matthews Associates [2007] 1 BCLC 666, para 284.”
In Naggar at [27]-[29], Arden LJ noted that in Holland’s case, the issue was whether Mr Holland had acted as de facto director of the relevant companies, or as de jure director of their corporate director, that is to say, that the question was the capacity in which he had carried out acts which were plainly directorial in nature. In other cases the issue will be whether the acts relied on are actually the acts of a director at all. In a passage adopted and applied by the Lieutenant Bailiff in the Carlyle case and relied upon by Mr Brown for the Claimant, Arden LJ helpfully summarised the effect of the authorities as follows:
“Practical points: what makes a person a de facto director?
Lord Collins JSC sensibly held that there was no one definitive test for a de facto director. The question is whether he was part of the corporate governance system of the company and whether he assumed the status and function of a director so as to make himself responsible as if he were a director. However, a number of points arise out of Holland's case and the previous cases which are of general practical importance in determining who is a de facto director. I note these points in the following paragraphs.
The concepts of shadow director and de facto are different but there is some overlap.
A person may be de facto director even if there was no invalid appointment. The question is whether he has assumed responsibility to act as a director.
To answer that question, the court may have to determine in what capacity the director was acting (as in Holland's case).
The court will in general also have to determine the corporate governance structure of the company so as to decide in relation to the company's business whether the defendant's acts were directorial in nature.
The court is required to look at what the director actually did and not any job title actually given to him.
A defendant does not avoid liability if he shows that he in good faith thought he was not acting as a director. The question whether or not he acted as a director is to be determined objectively and irrespective of the defendant's motivation or belief.
The court must look at the cumulative effect of the activities relied on. The court should look at all the circumstances “in the round” (per Jonathan Parker J in Secretary of State for Trade and Industry v Jones [1999] BCC 336).
It is also important to look at the acts in their context. A single act might lead to liability in an exceptional case.
Relevant factors include: (i) whether the company considered him to be a director and held him out as such; (ii) whether third parties considered that he was a director.
The fact that a person is consulted about directorial decisions or his approval does not in general make him a director because he is not making the decision.
Acts outside the period when he is said to have been a de facto director may throw light on whether he was a de facto director in the relevant period.
In my judgment, the question whether a director is a de facto or shadow director is a question of fact and degree…”
Paragraphs 16 and 17 of the Particulars of Claim plead as follows:
Mr Ali Ahmad performed the functions of a director of [the Claimant] and was therefore a de facto director of [the Claimant], at least in relation to the DC158 and 7EP Loans and the Vordere Transaction. In particular:
Mr Ali Ahmad was sent extensive information about the Company’s activities by Mr Hofgren and other and, in particular, sent and received a large number of significant emails in relation to the DC158 Loan, the 7EP Loan and the Vordere Transaction;
Mr Ahmad was consulted about significant decisions in relation to [the Claimant] (including in the emails referred to in paragraphs 26 and 35 below);
Mr Ali Ahmad appears to have had the final say in relation to certain major decisions made by [the Claimant], including decisions as to the amount to be advanced under the DC158 Loan and whether the Company should enter into the Vordere Transaction;
Further, it appears from such emails that Mr Hofgren deferred to Mr Ali Ahmad’s judgment in relation to key decisions concerning the affairs of [the Claimant], including decisions as to the terms of the DC158 Loan and the Vordere Transaction;
Mr Ali Ahmad participated with Mr Hofgren in meetings on behalf of [the Claimant] with Dolphin and Vordere, at which the key commercial terms of the DC158 Loan, the 7EP Loan and the Vordere Transaction were negotiated and agreed ([the Claimant] relies in particular in this regard on the meetings referred to in paragraphs 27 and 53 below).
As a de facto director of [the Claimant], Mr Ali Ahmad owed the same duties to [the Claimant] as a de jure director, being those duties set out at paragraphs 15(1) to 15(3) above. In the alternative, Mr Ali Ahmad’s involvement with [the Claimant], as set out in the preceding paragraphs, was such that, in all the circumstances, he owed [the Claimant] the duties set out at paragraphs 15(1) to 15(3) above.”
Although the second part of paragraph 17 of the Particulars of Claim puts an alternative basis on which Mr Ahmad is alleged to have owed the Claimant the same duties as Mr Hofgren and Mr Cheek, Mr Phillips points out that the witness evidence put before Master Pester only characterised the claim against Mr Ahmad as one of de facto director.
Mr Phillips takes each set of particulars set out in paragraph 16 and submits that none of the matters pleaded in paragraphs 16(1), (2), (4) or (5) are sufficient to establish that Mr Ahmad was acting as a director. As to paragraph 16(3), in which it is alleged that Mr Ahmad had the “final say” in relation to major decisions, including as to the amount to be advanced under the DC158 Loan and whether the Claimant should enter into the Vordere Transaction, Mr Phillips submits:
that the only pleaded allegation that Mr Ahmad was involved in the decision about the amount to be advanced under the DC158 Loan is a reference in paragraph 26 to an email exchange in which it is said to be “a question for Ali” to determine the currency conversion rate, which is not sufficient evidence of Mr Ahmad performing directorial acts; and
that the only pleaded allegation against Mr Ahmad in relation to the Vordere Transaction is at paragraph 53 of the Particulars of Claim, in which it is alleged that in around March 2019, Mr Hofgren and Mr Ahmad “held discussions” with Dolphin Group in relation to a proposal to convert the Claimant’s security under the DC158 and 7EP Loans into shares in Vordere. “Holding discussions” is not, submits Mr Phillips, a directorial act.
Mr Brown submits that paragraph 16 pleads the essential fact, namely that Mr Ahmad performed the functions of a director of the Claimant. Following the guidance given in Okbapi, I should assume that fact to be true. What follows in paragraph 16 are only particulars of that central factual allegation. Some of those particulars, for example at paragraph 16(3) and (4) are in themselves evidence of Mr Ahmad performing directorial functions. Other particulars will have to be seen in their overall context at trial. This hearing is not, he submits, the place to determine the proper interpretation of, for example, the emails which Mr Phillips has referred me to. He also refers me to the evidence adduced by the Claimant which I have referred to above, and to the likelihood of further evidence becoming available by the time of a trial. In particular he notes that the GFSC has carried out an investigation into D1, GFG PCC and Mr Hofgren and produced a report. Whilst I have not permitted that report to be adduced in evidence on these applications, its existence indicates the likelihood of there being further material available to the parties by the time of a trial, which is not currently before the court.
I consider that the Claimant has shown that there are reasonable prospects of success in its claim that Mr Ahmad was a de facto director (or otherwise owed the Claimant the same duties as Mr Hofgren and Mr Cheek), essentially for the reasons given by Mr Brown. Whether a person has become a de facto director is a question of fact and degree: a judgment will need to be made in the round on all the evidence available at trial, which will include disclosure and witness evidence not currently available to the court. Whilst I accept Mr Phillips’ submission that not all of the particulars under paragraph 16 of the Particulars of Claim, viewed individually, constitute evidence of Mr Ahmad acting as a director of the Claimant, some of them, particularly paragraph 16(3), do. The other particulars may, or may not, support the general proposition which is pleaded at the beginning of paragraph 16 when they are properly considered together and in context at a trial. The central proposition of fact which is pleaded in paragraph 16 is that Mr Ahmad performed the functions of a director of the Claimant, at least in relation to the relevant transactions, and that is supported by Mr Clark’s evidence. The fact that Mr Ahmad, through Mr Bechelet’s evidence, disputes that he acted as director merely shows that there is a triable issue. The advisory agreements produced by Mr Bechelet are clearly relevant and it may be that when the matter comes to trial Mr Ahmad will be able to show that he was acting only in an advisory capacity, pursuant to those agreements. However, the existence of the agreements is not conclusive: Henderson & Jones Ltd v Ross [2023] EWHC 1276 (Ch) at [400]. This is not a case where there is an obvious answer in law to the Claimant’s claim or the Claimant’s pleaded case is so obviously unsustainable that there is no need for a trial to determine whether it can be made good.
No good reason/exceptional circumstances for service by alternative means
Mr Ahmad contends that there was no good reason (or exceptional circumstance) justifying an order for service by alternative means in circumstances where the Treaty would have allowed for service. Mr Phillips argues that, pursuant to Articles 7-10, the UK may request a particular method of service and the UAE may serve by that method if it does not contravene its own domestic law. It would therefore have been open to the Claimant, he contends, to apply for the UK authorities to have requested that the UAE serve by SMS/WhatsApp or email, as Master Pester’s order permitted.
It might be thought that this is a somewhat odd position for Mr Ahmad to adopt, since he is arguing that he should have been served by SMS, WhatsApp or email, as he in fact was served, but only after the lengthy processes under the Treaty had taken place, rather than more speedily pursuant to Master Pester’s order. Proper service of proceedings is undoubtedly important, but this is clearly a technical argument, rather than one of substantial justice.
In support of its application to Master Pester, the Claimant adduced evidence from Nicola Jackson, a Legal Director of Clyde & Co in Dubai. She explained that she had been instructed by the Claimant to effect personal service on Mr Ahmad at an address given (with misspellings corrected) as “Unit 6, Diamond Building, Tiara Residence, Palm Jumeirah, Dubai, United Arab Emirates”. Not having been able to get an answer at either Apartment G06 on the ground floor or Apartment D06 on the deck level (first floor), Ms Jackson sought help from the security personnel to identify Mr Ahmad’s apartment and showed them a photograph of him. This led to a security guard telephoning Mr Ahmad, who passed the phone to Ms Jackson. When Ms Jackson explained that she had a package for him from iLaw in the UK (the Claimant’s previous solicitors), the person on the phone became irate and started shouting “return to sender” repeatedly. He refused to provide his apartment number and ended the call. The person on the phone subsequently called the security guard back and said that he should tell Ms Jackson to go and not give her any information.
Ms Jackson’s witness statement refers to the Treaty and notes that it is arguable whether or not it is mandatory, referring to the discussion in the Cesfin case. She also gave evidence that the Central Authority in the UAE ordinarily serves documents by hand. Historically this had been by a court bailiff, but is now done by an authorised courier company. The courier will attend the recipient’s address and, if there is no answer, may either affix the documents to the door of the premises or return them to the Central Authority for return to the UK. Where service is to be effected on an individual, the latter is more likely. Ms Jackson expressed the view that, given Mr Ahmad’s behaviour when she attempted service, it was highly likely that the Central Authority in the UAE would not be able to complete service on Mr Ahmad by hand in Dubai.
Before Master Pester, the Claimant also adduced evidence from Mr Clark (witness statement 9 October 2023 (“Clark 1”), paragraphs 85-96) that Mr Ahmad had refused to give any current address but that the telephone number it had was likely to bring the proceedings to his attention. He also explained that the Foreign Process Section were then experiencing a three-month backlog in the processing of claims and that service in Dubai was likely to take several months. Whilst acknowledging that delay on its own might not be a sufficient reason for attempting to serve in Dubai, he suggested that when it was coupled with the likelihood that service under the Treaty was unlikely to be effective, the extended period was a further factor in favour of permission to serve by alternative means.
On these applications, Mr Ahmad has, through Mr Ellis, contended that he was not the person to whom Ms Jackson spoke by telephone, who may have been a former employee. Mr Clark however notes that he received a phone call from Mr Ahmad himself on that number on 7 November 2023.
On the application of the Treaty, Mr Ellis says that he had made enquiries of a lawyer practising in the UAE as to whether service by the Central Authority by SMS, WhatsApp or email would be unlawful. Mr Ellis says that he does not waive privilege in his communications with this lawyer, but that it is his understanding that there would be nothing unlawful in this. It seems to me that very little weight can be placed on this as evidence of UAE law or practice. The lawyer is not identified and Mr Ellis specifically says that he is not waiving privilege in his communications with them. He does not purport to relay the contents of the communications he has had, but rather to offer his own opinion or understanding of UAE law (in which he does not claim to be qualified).
In contrast, the Claimant relies upon a letter from Clyde & Co in Dubai, which disagrees with Mr Ellis’s evidence. The letter states that it is unlikely that service can be effected in the UAE via the Central Authority by SMS, WhatsApp or email, although there is no express provision stating that it is not possible. The Clyde & Co dispute resolution team are not aware of the Central Authority ever serving documents electronically; there is no express provision for it to do so and they are not aware of any practice of doing so. Further, the relevant law (Article 10(6) of the UAE Federal Law No. 42 of 2022) implies that if a serving party can serve proceedings electronically with permission of the foreign court, it is required to do so, with service through diplomatic channels being a last resort.
In all the circumstances, it seems to me that the Claimant has shown good reason (or, to the extent necessary, exceptional circumstances) justifying an order for service by alternative means under CPR 6.15 rather than under the Treaty. This is because:
there is clear evidence that Mr Ahmad has sought and would seek to evade service of the proceedings on him. This comes, not only from Ms Jackson’s evidence, but from evidence of other evasive behaviour on his part. He refused to give the Claimant’s solicitors his current address and even on the application to set aside Master Pester’s order, offers no details as to where he lives or what his contact details are. Mr Bechelet’s witness statement states his instructions that Mr Ahmad is a resident of Dubai, but does not give an address. Further, in response to the submission that Mr Ahmad had not offered to submit to the jurisdiction of the Guernsey court (with which I shall deal further below), Mr Bechelet says that “Mr Ahmed tells me he does not welcome litigation in any jurisdiction”. This is a polite way of saying that Mr Ahmad would not undertake to submit to the submission of the Guernsey court. Consequently, in my judgment, there is a high chance that any attempt to serve Mr Ahmad personally in Dubai would be unsuccessful; and
there is, to put it at its lowest, very significant doubt as to whether electronic service could be effected by the UAE authorities under the Treaty. Given the backlog at the Foreign Process Section and the time it would likely take for the UAE authorities to process any request, once made, there is a high chance that it might be finally ascertained only after many months had passed that the UAE authorities were unable or unwilling to accede to any request to serve by electronic means. Expecting the Claimant to wait until that process had resulted in a dead end before making an application for permission under CPR 6.15 would not serve the ends of justice. It is part of Mr Phillips’ complaint, on behalf of Mr Ahmad, that this claim was issued at the very end of the limitation period. It would not be in the interests of any of the parties or conducive to the proper administration of justice for the proceedings to have been prolonged by a failed attempt to utilise the Treaty service procedures.
Failure to give full and frank disclosure
Mr Ahmad contends that the Claimant failed to make full and frank disclosure to Master Pester in the following ways:
in relation to the strength of the claim against Mr Ahmad, it is said that there was no discussion before Master Pester of the law relating to de facto directors and no analysis of paragraphs 16 and 17 of the Particulars of Claim, also that no reference was made to any other capacity in which Mr Ahmad may have been acting;
in relation to the issue of forum, it is said that the Claimant needed to, and failed to, ensure that the points which Mr Hofgren and Mr Cheek were by then making on jurisdiction were properly brought to the court’s attention, including their reliance on an Investment Management Agreement dating from April 2014 (“the 2014 Agreement”), the relevance of which I shall address below;
in relation to service under the Treaty, it is said that there was really no reference to the possibility of service by electronic means under the provisions of the Treaty; and
that there was no sufficient attempt to address the issue as to whether Mr Hofgren had been properly served.
Clark 1 addressed the obligation to give full and frank disclosure over 31 paragraphs, dealing with a number of different topics.
In relation to the claim that Mr Ahmad was a de facto director, Mr Clark referred at paragraph 10 of his witness statement to Mr Ahmad being an adviser to D1 and the ultimate beneficial owner of two advisory companies. He made clear that the Claimant was contending that Mr Ahmad was also a de facto director of the Claimant and, at paragraphs 16-17 of the witness statement and by reference to supporting documents, set out the basis for this claim. I do not consider the Claimant was required to go further and analyse the Particulars of Claim (which were shown to Master Pester) or refer to authority. When a claimant contends that a defendant occupies a certain position or plays a certain role, it is obvious that the defendant may contest the facts on which that contention is made or that they meet the legal test required. I do not consider that the Claimant was required to go further than it did to present the claim fairly to Master Pester in all material respects.
In relation to the forum arguments, Mr Clark referred (at paragraph 66) to Mr Hofgren and Mr Cheek’s challenge to jurisdiction. At paragraphs 80-84 he set out why the Claimant contends that England is the appropriate forum, and in doing so referred (at paragraph 82) to the arguments which Mr Hofgren and Mr Cheek had made in pre-action correspondence. He specifically referred to the 2014 Agreement and noted that it contains Guernsey arbitration, governing law and non-exclusive jurisdiction clauses. At paragraph 83(5), he set out the Claimant’s rebuttal. This was sufficient for Master Pester to understand that there was a real issue as to proper jurisdiction and that the arguments to be had would include arguments about the application of the 2014 Agreement: more was not, in my view, necessary to present the position fairly.
In relation to the Treaty, both Ms Jackson and Mr Clark expressly referred to the Treaty and to the debate as to whether it provides a permissive or exclusive method of service, highlighting the issue as to whether the test for departing from the Treaty methods of service is one of “good reason” or “exceptional circumstances”. It is true that this evidence does not focus on the potential for service under the Treaty by electronic means, but in circumstances where (as shown by the Clyde & Co letter) Ms Jackson and her colleagues had no experience of the UAE authorities ever serving in that way, that is hardly surprising. An applicant without notice cannot be expected to anticipate every single legal argument which the respondent’s solicitors or counsel might subsequently land upon. Again, I do not consider that the way it was put to Master Pester involved a failure to give full and frank disclosure.
As regards service on Mr Hofgren, Mr Clark brought to the court’s attention (paragraphs 123-126 of Clark 1) Mr Hofgren’s application and the arguments which he was making. He did not specifically refer to caselaw, but did make Master Pester aware that if Mr Hofgren was right, he would not be an anchor defendant for the purposes of the relevant gateway (paragraph 123). That was the key material issue of which Master Pester needed to be aware. It is true that Mr Clark did not refer to the incorrect addition of “Thomas More Street” in the address, but that was because it had not been noted at that time: it was raised for the first time by Mr Bechelet in July 2024. Nothing more was required of the Claimant in my judgment to present the position fairly to Master Pester.
The Appropriate Forum Application and D1’s Application
The Individual Defendants argue that the appropriate forum for determination of this dispute is Guernsey. D1’s position is that it is entirely neutral on the question of forum, but that it is important that all claims are heard together, whether in England or in Guernsey.
The 2014 and 2017 Agreements
In this context there was a dispute about the applicability of two agreements, the 2014 Agreement I have briefly referred to above, and an agreement made in 2017 (“the 2017 Agreement”).
The 2014 Agreement is dated 3 April 2014 and is made between D1, referred to as the “Investment Manager” and GFG PCC, referred to as “the Company”. Clause 24 provides:
“This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Island of Guernsey and subject to clause 22 (Arbitration), the parties agree to submit to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the island of Guernsey.”
By clause 2.1 of the 2014 Agreement, GFG PCC appoints D1 to manage its investment affairs and, by clause 3.1, D1 is to manage the investment and reinvestment of the “Cellular Assets”. For these services, by clause 6, D1 is to receive a fee from GFG PCC. “Cellular Assets” is defined as:
“the assets of the Company attributable to a Cell…”
“Cell” is defined as:
“the cells listed in Schedule 2 together with each Additional Cell, each being a cell of the Company created in accordance with and subject to the provisions of [the Companies (Guernsey) Law 2008 as amended]”.
“Additional Cell” means:
“any additional cell of the Company for which the Investment Manager has, from time to time, agreed to provide the Services, as set out in Schedule 3 to this Agreement.”
Xenfin Cell is not listed in either Schedule 2 or Schedule 3.  At clause 19 is a provision which states that no amendment or variation of the agreement will be valid unless confirmed as agreed in writing by an authorised signatory of each party and, if required under Guernsey collective investment scheme rules, the GFSC.
The 2017 Agreement is dated 24 March 2017 and is made between D1, referred to as the “Manager”, the Claimant, referred to as the “SPV” and Xenfin Capital Ltd (“Xenfin Capital”), referred to as the “Advisor”. By clause 29.1:
“This Agreement shall be construed and governed in accordance with English law. Disputes arising under, out of or connected with this Agreement shall be subject to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the English courts to which the parties hereby submit.”
The 2017 Agreement has a series of recitals. By recital (A), it refers to the incorporation of GFG PCC, referred to as “the Company”, and its authorisation by GFSC as a Class B open-ended investment scheme. The recitals then continue:
The Manager was appointed as the investment manager of the Company, and by implication all protected cell sub-funds of the Company, on 3 April 2014.
Xenfin Securitised Debt Fund 1 (“Cell”) is a protected cell of the Company. The SPV is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Cell and is used as an investment vehicle for the benefit of the Cell. It is managed by the Manager.
The SPV has assets in an Account with the Bank.
In respect of the sums deposited by the SPV in the Account (or such sums as are otherwise agreed between the Manager and the Advisor), the Manager wishes to appoint the Advisor to present it with proposed investments and, following Manager approval, place those investments using its platform and the Advisor is willing to accept the appointment on the terms and conditions contained in this Agreement.”
For the purposes of the Appropriate Forum Application, the Claimant relies, as against D1, on the English law and English non-exclusive jurisdiction clause in the 2017 Agreement. On the other hand, the Individual Defendants rely on the Guernsey law and Guernsey non-exclusive jurisdiction clause in the 2014 Agreement as a connection to Guernsey. This is even though the Individual Defendants are not themselves parties to the 2014 Agreement. D1, which is a party to the 2014 Agreement, is, as I have said, neutral on the question of forum but keen to ensure that all claims are heard together. Consequently, because it was the Claimant’s position (at least up until the hearing before me) that the jurisdiction clause in the 2017 Agreement was sufficient to require the claims against D1 to be tried in England even if the claims against the Individual Defendants were heard in Guernsey, Ms Lucas addressed me on the two Agreements on behalf of D1.
In seeking to decide the question whether either jurisdiction clause applies, at this stage of the proceedings the court faces two issues. First, the Claimant is not named as a party to the 2014 Agreement, indeed it was not incorporated until after the 2014 Agreement. Whether the Claimant is bound by the jurisdiction clause is a matter of Guernsey law. On this point, I have been provided with expert reports from Advocate Gordon Dawes on behalf of the Individual Defendants and Advocate Robert Breckon on behalf of the Claimant, however at this interlocutory stage, neither of the experts have been subject to cross-examination. Moreover, it is apparent, reading the reports, that the Guernsey law analysis is likely to turn on questions of fact which will not be determined until the trial. Secondly, if the jurisdiction clauses in both the 2014 and 2017 Agreements potentially apply to the claims in these proceedings, then it is necessary to construe the two clauses to see which one applies. This construction process, however, may also turn on questions of fact (particularly the context in which each Agreement was made) and on questions of Guernsey law, which the expert reports do not address, as to the construction of the 2014 Agreement.
The parties were all agreed that it was necessary for me to consider the effect of the 2014 and 2017 Agreements in order to determine the applications before me but that any decision I may make can only be a provisional one and will not bind the trial judge.
In Goldman Sachs International v Novo Banco SA [2018] UKSC 34, [2018] 1 WLR 3683 at [9], the Supreme Court confirmed the test for dealing with a disputed fact in the context of a jurisdiction issue at an interlocutory stage:
“This is, accordingly, a case in which the fact on which jurisdiction depends is also likely to be decisive of the action itself if it proceeds. For the purpose of determining an issue about jurisdiction, the traditional test has been whether the claimant had ‘the better of the argument’ on the facts going to jurisdiction. In Brownlie v Four Seasons Holdings Inc [2018] 1 WLR 192 , para 7, this court reformulated the effect of that test as follows: ‘(i) that the claimant must supply a plausible evidential basis for the application of a relevant jurisdictional gateway; (ii) that if there is an issue of fact about it, or some other reason for doubting whether it applies, the court must take a view on the material available if it can reliably do so; but (iii) the nature of the issue and the limitations of the material available at the interlocutory stage may be such that no reliable assessment can be made, in which case there is a good arguable case for the application of the gateway if there is a plausible (albeit contested) evidential basis for it.’ It is common ground that the test must be satisfied on the evidence relating to the position as at the date when the proceedings were commenced.”
In Kaefer Aislamientos SA de CV v AMS Drilling Mexico SA de CV [2019] EWCA Civ 10, [2019] 1 WLR 3514 the Court of Appeal endeavoured to state how that test should be applied in practice. As summarised in Dicey, Morris and Collins on The Conflict of Laws 16th edn paragraph 12-083, Kaefer establishes:
“that, first, the party relying on the existence of the agreement must supply an evidential basis showing that it has the better argument (and not much the better argument); second, if there is an issue of fact about it, or some other reason for doubting whether it applies, the court must take a view on the material available if it can reliably do so; but, third, the nature of the issue and the limitations of the material available at the interlocutory stage may be such that no reliable assessment can be made, in which case there is a good arguable case for the existence of the agreement if there is a plausible (albeit contested) evidential basis for it.”
As regards competing jurisdiction clauses, Dicey, Morris and Collins at 12-082 says (this summary being adopted by Henshaw J in Clifford Chance LLP v Societe Générale SA [2023] EWHC 2682):
“The complexity of international commercial and financial transactions has resulted in the frequent use of inter-linked contracts. Because jurisdiction clauses are not generally the subject of close negotiation or scrutiny, it frequently happens that there are inconsistent jurisdiction clauses, or situations in which one or more contracts have jurisdiction clauses and others do not. Which, if any, jurisdiction clause applies to a dispute is entirely a matter of construction, and where English law governs the jurisdiction agreement, a matter of the application of established principles of contractual construction. It may be that the many decisions in this area have over-elaborated the application of familiar principles of construction, but the following propositions can be derived from them: (1) Jurisdiction clauses should be construed widely and generously. (2) An agreement which is part of a series of agreements should be construed by taking into account the overall scheme of the agreements. (3) It is generally to be assumed that just as parties to a single agreement do not intend as rational business people that disputes under the same agreement be determined by different tribunals, parties to an arrangement between them set out in multiple related agreements do not generally intend a dispute to be litigated in two different tribunals. (4) Where there are multiple related agreements, the task of the court in determining whether the dispute falls within the jurisdiction clauses of one or more related agreements depends upon the intention of the parties as revealed by the agreements (at the time when they were entered into) as against these general principles. (5) Rational business people are unlikely to intend that disputes between them should fall within the scope of two inconsistent jurisdiction clauses. (6) What is required is a broad, purposive and commercially-minded construction, in the light of the transaction as a whole, taking into account the overall scheme of the agreements and reading sentences and phrases in the context of that overall scheme. (7) This may include enquiring under which of a number of inter-related contractual agreements a dispute actually arises, and seeking to do so by locating its centre of gravity and thus which jurisdiction clause is closer to the claim. (8) Nevertheless the normal process of construction may not be able to avoid a degree of fragmentation and overlap.”
Because it comes first in time, I will consider first the 2014 Agreement. It is the Individual Defendants who rely on clause 24 in this contract and who therefore must show a good arguable case that it applies to the claims against D1, in accordance with the requirements set out above. Advocate Dawes provided an initial expert report dated 1 November 2023, in which he addressed (a) the nature of the legal relationship between a protected cell company, its cells and its cells subsidiaries and/or SPVs; and (b), in light of (a) and the 2014 Agreement, whether clauses 22 (arbitration) and 24 (governing law and jurisdiction) are binding on the Claimant. He says:
“In answer to the question posed, I believe it is strongly arguable that the [2014 Agreement] provisions (including clauses 22 and 24) bind [the Claimant] vis-à-vis [D1]. I am not aware that there was every any express contract made directly between the [Claimant] and [D1]. However, we know from the [2014 Agreement] that it was intended [D1] should be the investment manager for the whole structure given that [GFG PCC] is a single legal entity acting for all cells (which, as noted, have no separate legal personality and cannot themselves contract) and cell assets such as [the Claimant] (the existence of such entities being expressly contemplated by the 2008 Law as above) formed a part of that structure; see generally clauses 2.1 and 3.1 of the [2014 Agreement] and the reference to “Cellular Assets” and the definition of that term at clause 1.2. One could argue for GFG PCC acting both for Xenfin Cell (being a part of the same legal entity) and as agent for the [Claimant] as a (then future) Cellular Asset in making the [2014 Agreement]. And of course [the Claimant] did not exist at the time the [2014 Agreement] was made.”
He then refers to the Claimant’s resolution of 27 March 2017 which, he says, takes it as given that D1 is the Claimant’s investment manager and to the Xenfin Cell annual report for the year ended 30 April 2018. He also says that it could be inferred that the investment management fees are paid by reference to the Claimant and the management of its assets.
Advocate Breckon, in response, draws attention to the lack of any reference to Xenfin Cell in Schedule 2 to the 2014 Agreement. He says that, in order to adopt the 2014 Agreement, both Xenfin Cell and the Claimant would need corporate authority to approve accession thereto. He can find no appointment of D1 by the Claimant in the minutes dated 27 March 2017. Moreover, he says, the 2014 Agreement provides for a specific contractual route through which additional cells are appointed, pursuant to Schedule 3. Any accession by the Claimant, which is not a cell, would constitute an amendment to the 2014 Agreement, which, pursuant to clause 19 thereof, is only valid if agreed in writing. He concludes:
“On the evidence before me, the [2014 Agreement] does not amount to a legally binding agreement with [the Claimant].”
A further report from Advocate Dawes was produced in reply to that of Advocate Breckon and in response to witness evidence served by the Claimant. He states his opinion that the absence of Xenfin Cell from Schedule 3 is not conclusive and that it is a matter of fact as to whether D1 had “agreed to provide the Services” to any additional cells. The evidence which he had seen and referred to in his earlier report suggested that it had. The issue was why Schedule 3 was not added to and whether this was deliberate or an oversight. Having referred to the familiar principle of English contract law, also applicable in Guernsey, that contractual relations may be made or altered by conduct, at paragraph 15 he says:
“And again it is not strictly a question of whether the [2014 Agreement] became legally binding between [D1] and [the Claimant] (because [the Claimant] would not become a party even if the Xenfin Cell had been identified under Schedule 3) as opposed to [D1] owing duties as investment manager to [the Claimant] under [the 2014 Agreement], itself governed by Guernsey law, arbitration and jurisdiction.”
Similarly, in responding to the additional witness evidence he says at paragraph 27:
“…I do not say that [the Claimant] became a party to the [2014 Agreement] but I stand by the suggestion that it is at least strongly arguable that the [2014 Agreement] governed the investment management relationship between [D1] and [the Claimant].”
If the Claimant is bound by the 2014 Agreement and, in particular by its governing law and jurisdiction clause, then there is, as I understand it, no dispute that the claims which it brings against D1 would fall within the scope of that clause, subject to any later variation of the clause. It seems to me from the Guernsey law expert reports that there may be three different questions to be answered before it can be known whether the Claimant is so bound. The first is the question of fact, whether the relationship between the Claimant and the First Defendant was treated as governed by the 2014 Agreement. The second is whether clause 19 would, as a matter of Guernsey law, prevent the Claimant being bound by the 2014 Agreement even if it was. The third is, in any event, whether the Claimant would be treated as having submitted to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the Guernsey courts as a matter of the construction of clause 24, given that in that clause “the parties” agree to submit to that jurisdiction, and on any basis, it appears from Advocate Dawes’ evidence, the Claimant would not have been “a party” to the 2014 Agreement.
As to the question of fact, it seems to me that this is an issue on which I am able to take a view, albeit on the limited materials available to the court at this hearing and recognising that much more evidence will be available to the trial judge following disclosure and witness statements. In my judgment, the Individual Defendants have the better argument in contending that the relationship between the Claimant and D1 was treated as governed by the 2014 Agreement. Recitals (B) and (C) to the 2017 Agreement are strong evidence of this although, like Advocate Breckon, I find it difficult to see any such evidence in the minutes to which Advocate Dawes refers. Importantly, however, it is part of the Claimant’s pleaded case that the agreement between the Claimant and D1, under which D1 would act as the investment manager to the Claimant was made orally or by conduct soon after the Claimant’s incorporation (paragraph 10 of the Particulars of Claim). As Ms Lucas points out, the argument which is made in some of the Claimant’s evidence for this hearing, namely that D1 was appointed the Claimant’s investment manager by the 2017 Agreement, is made only as an alternative case in paragraph 11 of the Particulars of Claim. The Claimant has moved away from its own pleaded case in order to argue the points which the Individual Defendants have raised in relation to jurisdiction.
However, I am unable to make a reliable assessment as to the answer to the two points of Guernsey law referred to in paragraph 65 above, given the conflicting expert reports and absence of cross-examination. Treating evidence of foreign law as a question of fact, and therefore subject to the principles discussed in Kaefer, Advocate Dawes’ evidence provides a plausible evidential basis for the Claimant being bound by the jurisdiction clause of the 2014 Agreement, even though that evidence is contested by Advocate Breckon. Consequently, in my judgment the Individual Defendants have shown a good arguable case that (subject to any later effect of the 2017 Agreement), the contractual relationship between the Claimant and D1 is governed by Guernsey law and the Claimant is to be taken as having agreed to submit to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the Guernsey courts in relation to the claims against D1.
The next question is the effect of the 2017 Agreement. Here the burden of showing a good arguable case that the jurisdiction clause applies to the claims against D1 lies on the Claimant. Both the Claimant and D1 were parties to the 2017 Agreement, so there is no issue which arises in that respect. The question must be whether, applying the principles set out in paragraph 61 above, the jurisdiction clause in the 2017 Agreement was intended to cover the claims made against D1 and (if the Individual Defendants are right about the effect of the 2014 Agreement) supersede or vary clause 22 of the 2014 Agreement. There would appear to be no issue over the application of clause 19 of the 2014 Agreement, as any such variation made by the 2017 Agreement has been made in writing by an authorised signatory of the Claimant and D1.
Unlike the 2014 Agreement, the overriding purpose of the 2017 Agreement is not to appoint D1 as investment adviser to the Claimant. On the contrary, the recitals treat that appointment as having already occurred. Rather the purpose is to appoint Xenfin Capital to present D1 with suitable investments to be made by the Claimant and then to execute those investments on behalf of the Claimant.
Mr Brown’s argument is that the wording of clause 29.1 of the 2017 Agreement is substantially wider than clause 22 of the 2014 Agreement. It covers “disputes arising under, out of or connected with this Agreement”. Thus, says Mr Brown, this dispute is covered by the clause because it is “connected with” the 2017 Agreement, even if the 2017 Agreement does not govern the investment management relationship between the Claimant and D1.
In my judgment it is a necessary first step in this argument for the Claimant to show that the 2017 Agreement at least related to the Loans or the Vordere Transaction. I do not see how, even on the broad, purposive approach mandated by the authorities, the claim against D1 can even be said to be “connected with” the 2017 Agreement, if the transactions on which the claims are brought were not made on the advice of Xenfin Capital or executed by Xenfin Capital on behalf of the Claimant pursuant to the 2017 Agreement. On this point, the evidence is extremely thin. The most that Mr Brown can point to is a passage in Clark 2 (paragraph 65), in which he is describing individuals and entities relevant to the claim. In this context he refers to Xenfin Capital and its CEO and shareholder, Mr MacInnes, saying:
“Mr MacInnes helped raise funds which the Company eventually loaned out, including the DC158 and 7EP loans.”
This is not, as it seems to me, an assertion that Xenfin Capital was acting under the 2017 Agreement in respect of the three relevant transactions, but rather that Mr MacInnes assisted with the raising of funds for the Claimant. The Particulars of Claim do not plead that Xenfin Capital was involved in the transactions or that they were undertaken pursuant to the 2017 Agreement (which is pleaded). For the purposes of a jurisdiction dispute, I cannot see that this amounts even to a “plausible, if contested” evidential basis for the contention that the 2017 Agreement applies to the claims in these proceedings.
For that reason I do not need to consider the potentially difficult question as to whether the governing law and jurisdiction clause in the 2017 Agreement would, as a matter of construction, have superseded or varied the relevant clause in the 2014 Agreement, assuming that (on the facts and evidence at trial) it is shown that the 2014 Agreement applies to the claims against D1.
Appropriate Forum – Law
There was no real dispute between the parties as to the principles which I should apply to determine whether the court should decline to exercise the jurisdiction which it would otherwise be able to assert over the Defendants (or, in the case of Mr Ahmad, whether Master Pester’s order should be set aside). These may be summarised as follows:
the task of the Court is to identify the forum in which the case can be suitably tried for the interests of all the parties and for the ends of justice: Spiliada Maritime Corporation v Cansulex Ltd [1987] 1 AC 460 at 480G. That is the forum with which the action has the most real and substantial connection: Spiliada at 478A. The court is looking for a single jurisdiction in which the claims against all the defendants may most suitably be tried: Lungowe v Vedanta Resources plc [2019] UKSC 20 [2020] AC 1045 at [68];
that task generally requires a summary examination of connecting factors between the case and one or more jurisdictions in which it could be litigated: Lungowe at [66]. There are many potentially relevant factors and the weight to be given to them will vary from case to case: Spiliada at 465D, 481G. They may include (a) the connection between the factual elements of the dispute to the competing jurisdictions; (b) the law governing the transaction; (c) the location of the parties to the dispute, both at the time of the events giving rise to the dispute and also during the course of the proceedings; (d) whether proceedings relating to the dispute between the applicant and the respondent would be fragmented by any order for or against a stay which the Court might make, and whether there would be concurrent proceedings in more than one jurisdiction, with the risk of inconsistent judgments being obtained in those jurisdictions; (e) the location and availability of documentary evidence (although whether this is a material practical consideration depends on the ease with which such documents can be digitally copied and transferred and whether there are caches of documents which require review only at particular locations) and (f) the location and availability of witnesses (bearing in mind that this last consideration may be mitigated if evidence can or is to be given remotely consistent with the requirement of a just and fair proceeding): Boettcher v Xio (UK) LLP [2023] EWHC 801 (Comm) at [88]. What the court needs to do is stand back and ask the practical question as to where the fundamental focus of the litigation is to be found: Erste Group Bank AG v JSC ‘VMZ Red October’ [2015] EWCA Civ 379, [2015] 1 CLC 706 at [149];
where a defendant seeks a stay on the ground of appropriate forum, the burden is on it to demonstrate that another overseas jurisdiction is available and is clearly the appropriate forum: Spiliada at 476D. Where a claimant seeks permission to serve out the burden is on it to persuade the court that England is clearly the appropriate forum: Altimo Holdings and Investment Ltd v Kyrgyz Mobil Tel Ltd [2011] UKPC 7, [2012] 1 WLR 1804 at [88];
a defendant challenging jurisdiction must identify another candidate, which does have jurisdiction to determine the dispute, and the question will be tested by reference to the identified candidate: Unwired Planet International Ltd v Huawei Technologies (UK) Co Ltd [2021] 1 All ER 1141 at [96];
even when a foreign court would not otherwise have jurisdiction over the defendant, an undertaking by the defendant to submit to its jurisdiction can make the foreign court an appropriate forum. However, the absence of such an undertaking may mean that the identified foreign court is not an available forum: UniCredit Bank GmbH v RusChemAlliance LLC [2024] 3 WLR 659 (SC) at [102]-[104];
where a claim is time-barred in the foreign jurisdiction and the claimant’s claim would undoubtedly be defeated if it were brought there, practical justice should be done, so that if the claimant acted reasonably in commencing proceedings in England, and did not act unreasonably in not commencing proceedings in the foreign country, it may not be just to deprive the claimant of the benefit of the English proceedings: Spiliada at 483D-484C; Altimo at [88].
Appropriate Forum – Decision
Mr Phillips argued that the appropriate forum is Guernsey, on the following grounds:
the claims against the Individual Defendants are governed by Guernsey law;
the claims against D1 are governed by Guernsey law, by virtue of the 2014 Agreement or the general law;
the investment structure is Guernsey-centred and based on a concept of Guernsey law – the protective cell company – which has no counterpart in English law. GFG PCC, D1 and C are all Guernsey companies with the Claimant being in liquidation in Guernsey;
that investment structure is regulated by the GFSC, which has already taken action in relation to the matters complained of in Guernsey. Issues of admissibility of the GFSC’s report are best handled by the Guernsey court and the existence of the report indicates that some of the available documents will be located in Guernsey;
the place where damage has been suffered is Guernsey, because the place of the obligation to repay the money loaned was Guernsey; and
there is no difficulty with the enforcement of a Guernsey judgment in England.
In response to the Claimant’s argument that it had not been shown that the Guernsey court had jurisdiction over the Individual Defendants, Mr Phillips referred to undertakings which had been given, shortly before the hearing of these applications, by all three, to submit to the jurisdiction of the Guernsey court. In any event, he argued that it had been Mr Hofgren and Mr Cheek’s position from the outset, voiced in response to the letters of claim, that the appropriate forum was Guernsey.
By the time it came to making oral submissions at the hearing, Mr Brown for the Claimant put his case for England being the appropriate forum very firmly on the principle in paragraph 73(vi) above. He contended that it was reasonable for the Claimant to have brought proceedings in England, given the number of connections with this jurisdiction and the absence (until shortly before the hearing) of any undertaking from the Individual Defendants to submit to the jurisdiction of the Guernsey court, and it would be unjust now to stay these proceedings (or, in Mr Ahmad’s case, set aside Master Pester’s order) given that proceedings in Guernsey on the Loans would be time-barred. Shifting from the position in his skeleton argument, Mr Brown argued that this was a case where there would be proceedings in England or not at all (because of the limitation issues) and there was therefore no question of different defendants being sued in different jurisdictions.
In my judgment, there are a number of important connections between the claims and England:
the Claimant’s evidence (Clark 2, paragraphs 55-58) indicates that although the Claimant is incorporated in Guernsey, it was managed by Mr Hofgren and Mr Cheek from England, which is where they were both living. Both are English nationals with multiple directorships with English companies. Mr Phillips sought to undermine this evidence by referring to some documents in the bundle which indicate that some meetings were held in Guernsey. I agree with Mr Brown, however, that this is not sufficient to meet Mr Clark’s evidence. If the Individual Defendants wished to contend that Mr Clark was wrong, they should have put in evidence that the Claimant was managed from Guernsey. They did not do so. Moreover, the emails on which the Claimant relies as evidence that Mr Ahmad was acting as de facto director (Clark 2, paragraphs 97-171) were sent from three email addresses connected to English companies. Mr Ahmad also has a UK mobile phone and fax number.
As a consequence of the management of the Claimant from England, the key decisions, in relation to the relevant transactions, were made in England. Thus in so far as the claims are founded on those decisions constituting breaches of contract, of fiduciary duty or of a duty in tort to exercise reasonable care, skill and diligence (in the case of D1) and breaches of directors’ duties (in the case of the Individual Defendants), the wrongdoing took place in England. The question of where loss was suffered is more controversial. Mr Brown argued that the damage in this respect was suffered in England because the payments were made to English accounts. Mr Phillips argued that loss was suffered when the payments were made out of the Claimant’s account in Guernsey. It seems to me that the proper analysis may be that loss was suffered when the Claimant became bound, as a matter of contract, to make the Loans or to enter into the Vordere Transaction. In this respect, it is not clear where the documentation was signed on behalf of the Claimant.
Vordere, in which shares were acquired, is an English company.
The investors who invested in the Claimant – i.e. the Claimant’s customers - are almost entirely based in England.
A number of relevant people, including potential witnesses, are identified in Clark 2, paragraph 65. It is clearly more convenient if witnesses based in England give their evidence here; it may only be possible to obtain evidence from some of these witnesses in England, where they are compellable.
In this context, I do not consider that the Guernsey connections are so strong as to make Guernsey the more appropriate forum. Formally the corporate entities are incorporated and regulated in Guernsey but, as I have said, the evidence indicates that the real people making the real decisions were based in England. The fact that some or all of the claims are governed by Guernsey law is relevant, but it appears likely that on most points Guernsey law will be the same as, or similar to, English law and there is no difficulty with the English court receiving expert evidence of Guernsey law. It does not appear likely that there will be any hotly contested area of Guernsey law which ought, properly, to be determined by the Guernsey courts. Most documents are likely to be available electronically, so their location is of little significance. The jurisdiction clause in the 2014 Agreement is (despite the amount of time spent arguing about it) in my judgment of little weight, given that it is non-exclusive: Chopra v Bank of Singapore Limited [2015] EWHC 1549 at [145] and that D1, which is the only defendant which could take advantage of it, is neutral on the question of forum.
Moreover, it would, in my judgment, be a significant injustice for the Claimant to be barred from bringing some of its claims because, having brought these proceedings in England, it is now time-barred in respect of those claims in Guernsey. It was reasonable for the Claimant to have commenced these proceedings in England given the degree of connection to England and given that, at the time it started the proceedings and indeed at all times until shortly before the hearing of these applications, the Individual Defendants had not submitted to the Guernsey jurisdiction. Thus, despite Mr Hofgren and Mr Cheek arguing from the outset that the claims against them should be brought in Guernsey, it was not an available forum. Moreover, as I have indicated above, Mr Ahmad made it very clear, through his solicitor, that he “did not welcome litigation in any jurisdiction” and there was therefore no reason to think that he would be prepared to submit himself to the jurisdiction of the Guernsey court.
In conclusion, the forum in which the case can be suitably tried for the interests of all the parties and for the ends of justice is England.
In the circumstances, the basis on which D1’s Application is made (that the court decides that it should not exercise its jurisdiction in relation to the claims against the Individual Defendants) does not arise and I need not address that application further.
Disposition
In light of my findings above, I dismiss the applications of the Individual Defendants and make no order on D1’s Application.

.............................
LORD JUSTICE BAKER :
The principal issue on this second appeal is whether a judge was wrong to make a final order in private children’s proceedings at a Dispute Resolution Appointment (“DRA”).
Background
The proceedings concern the parties’ three daughters, whom I shall refer to as A, now aged 11, B, rising 9, and C, 7. The parents were married in Ireland, their home country, but later moved to England. In 2018, the parents’ marriage broke down and, in January 2019, the father started divorce proceedings, whereupon the mother told him that she wanted to return to Ireland. The father then filed an application for a child arrangements order under which he would be the principal carer, and a prohibited steps order preventing the mother removing the children from the jurisdiction. The mother responded by filing an application for a specific issue order that she be permitted to relocate with the children to Ireland. Case management directions included a direction for a s.7 report by an independent social worker (“ISW”). In the course of her inquiries, the ISW spoke to A, then aged 5, but not the younger children. In her report, she recommended that the mother’s application to remove the children permanently to Ireland be refused and that there should be a child arrangements order under which the children’s time would be divided equally between the parents.
A contested final hearing took place before Deputy District Judge O’Leary in September 2019. At the hearing, the mother withdrew her relocation application. At the end of the hearing, the deputy district judge made a “shared care” order with each fortnight being divided under a 5:2:2:5 arrangement. The order of 24 September 2019 included a recital in these terms:
“If the father is unable to collect the children from school/nursery, he shall contact the mother offering that she collect the children instead and retain them thereafter until the father is able to collect them from her home. In the event that the mother is unable to collect and/or retain the children beyond 3.30pm, the father shall make his own childcare arrangements.”
Nine months later, in June 2020, the mother filed a further application seeking a variation of the child arrangements order. The following month, the father filed an application also seeking a variation of the order. A further report from the ISW was ordered. Sadly, the ISW died in the course of these second proceedings and the report was prepared by a second ISW, Ms X. In the course of her investigation, the mother filed a second application to remove the children permanently to Ireland. The proceedings were delayed by the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic during which the children were homeschooled in the mother’s home from Mondays to Thursdays and in the father’s home on Fridays.
In her report, Ms X identified that the children were experiencing some problems. In particular, C, then aged 3, was said to display challenging behaviour and experience difficulties in social relationships. Ms X referred to counter allegations of abusive behaviour made by the parties. In the course of her report, she observed:
“A, B and C are in need of stability at this juncture in their young lives. Given the complexity of their parents’ conflict, characterised by their respective expression of anxiety about their futures with their children creating a sense of instability, changing their worlds by moving them from their current homes, schools and daily routines will be destabilising for them.”
She recommended that the mother’s second relocation application be refused and that the shared care be maintained in accordance with the existing schedule, with minor alterations.
In June 2021, a three day hearing took place before Recorder Trowell QC, (as he then was). At the end of the hearing, the recorder delivered a judgment dismissing the mother’s relocation application and maintaining the existing “5:2:2:5” child arrangements order, with minor variations.
In the course of his judgment, the recorder summarised the mother’s case as including that the children, in particular C, were not flourishing under the current arrangements, that young children should have one fixed home which in this case should be with her, that the father relied on nannies because of the demands of his work, and that this complicated matters for the children. The recorder made the following observations about the mother which are relevant to the issues arising on the present appeal:
[Ms X] had no doubt that the mother was a capable parent. She did however think that the mother was an intense and an anxious parent. [Ms X] also raised in her oral evidence a concern that there was a risk that unconsciously the mother might act so as to diminish the father’s role with the children. She used the word ‘alienation’. [The mother’s counsel] says that word is misused by [Ms X], and it is clearly a heavily loaded word, so I shall not use it here but it is necessary for me to consider the risk that unconsciously the mother might diminish the father’s role.
I have absolutely no doubt but that the mother loves each of her children keenly. I have no doubt that she genuinely thinks that each of the children is loved by the father and that they love the father. Further I have no doubt that she does consciously acknowledge the importance of the father to the children. Where I think [Ms X]’s observation has force is that the mother does put problems in the children’s behaviour down to wrong day-to-day parenting by the father. I reach this conclusion having listened to her cross examination by Ms Fottrell on complaints and comments made by her of the father over the course of these proceedings. There may of course be occasions when the mother is right, but I do find that her general approach is to assume she is right, that he is wrong, and the problem would disappear if only the court would have (as she believes it should have done) entrusted her with the primary care of the children.”
Throughout the period of these two Children Act proceedings, the parties were also engaged in contested financial remedy proceedings which concluded in a final order in May 2022.
In February 2023, the mother filed an application to disclose parts of the order dated 24 September 2019 to the children’s school, in particular the recital relating to collection of the children set out above. The following month, C was diagnosed as being on the autistic spectrum (‘ASD’). In May 2023, the mother filed a further application for variation of the child arrangements order. In August 2023, the father filed an application for an order under s.91(14) preventing the mother making further applications without the court’s leave. The DRA was initially listed before a circuit judge on 6 September, but on that day she transferred the case to Deputy District Judge O’Leary, who had made the original order in 2019 and was coincidentally sitting in the same court that day. She made directions for the filing of statements, including by the mother “setting out the events and changes in circumstances since June 2021 in support of her application for a variation of the current child arrangements orders”, with a statement from the father in response. She also directed that Cafcass should file a safeguarding report pursuant to paragraph 13 of the Child Arrangements Programme in FPR PD12B and adjourned the case to 13 November “with a time estimate of 2 hours which is a DRA at which the Court will consider the parties’ applications”.
Both parties duly filed statements, with exhibits, which in the mother’s case included copies of messages and other documents in which she had raised concerns about the father’s care of the children. Prior to the adjourned DRA, two safeguarding letters were sent to the court by Cafcass. In the first, written at a time when safeguarding checks were incomplete, the family court adviser suggested that court obtain certain further information from the police, GP and the children’s school. As to the need for a further s.7 report, she advised:
“I am mindful that the children’s voices are missing from these proceedings and the Court may have a view on the need for these to be sought. I have considered this, on balance with the issues in question in these proceedings, and at this time do not advise that a further welfare assessment is proportionate to the need for further professional intervention in their lives.”
In the second letter, after concluding safeguarding inquiries, she advised:
“The Court may wish to clarify how [the father’s] behaviour has worsened towards [the mother] prior to considering its next directions. However, with the appropriate safeguards in place, it may be possible for the Court to resolve this matter without the need for a Section 7 report.”
After receiving the two letters, the mother contacted the family court adviser in order, she said, to provide “clarifying” information.
The hearing before the deputy district judge
At the hearing on 13 November, the mother was represented by Dr Charlotte Proudman and the father by Ms Deirdre Fottrell KC. After hearing submissions on whether to order a s.7 report, the deputy district judge indicated that she was not minded to order such a report but adjourned the matter for one week to 21 November with a view to giving judgment that day. In the event, she was unable to do so and instead heard further submissions on the father’s application for an order under s.91(14). At the conclusion of that hearing, she made an order dismissing the mother’s applications for an order under s.7, an order varying the child arrangements order and for disclosure of parts of that order to the school, and made an order under s.91(14) prohibiting the mother from making any applications for child arrangements orders or any other orders under s.8 of the Children Act or variation in the existing orders and any applications under s.13 of the Act without the leave of the court for three years, any such application to be reserved in the first instance to the deputy district judge, if available.
On 22 January 2024, the deputy district judge handed down a written judgment setting out the reasons for her decision. Having summarised the background, she summarised the mother’s case in these terms:
“The mother’s case was that there are new things known about the children and that their wishes and feelings have not been ascertained and this should be done. The mother also makes many complaints about the father and his parenting all of which, she says, could be solved if the children were in her care as the primary care giver. She complains, among other things, that he leaves too much of the parenting of the girls to nannies. She complains that he has not ensured that medication… is properly applied. B had a viral infection in her genital area and it is the mother’s case that this was not treated properly with medication and appropriate medical creams and that it did not clear up as it should have done. She blames this on the father’s neglectful parenting and that he delegated the application of medication to nannies who did not do so correctly.”
The deputy district judge referred to the two safeguarding letters sent by Cafcass. She continued:
“After receipt of each safeguarding letter, the mother chose to contact the author to mention more complaints or concerns about the father’s deficient care of the children. This form of additional complaint is a feature of the way that this mother behaves. It is one of the reasons why the father seeks a s 91(14) order. There is a complaint about the father having thrown water over A one morning to wake her up. This complaint has been accepted to an extent by the father. He says it has been exaggerated and the water was not a cupful, but some drops. The mother’s statement within these applications is a litany of complaints about the father and not each and every one has been covered in this judgment. The mother does not accept what she is told by professionals and seeks to add to complaints. This is similar to the mother not accepting the decisions of two different judges who heard evidence and both came to the same conclusion about the children benefiting from spending equal time with each parent.”
The deputy district judge then set out details of the girls’ current circumstances. In respect of C, she noted that, as set out above at paragraph 9, she had been diagnosed with ASD. This was considered to be the explanation for her behavioural difficulties which had been evident at the time of the earlier proceedings. She recorded that the mother maintained that her behaviour was attributable to deficits in the father’s parenting. She continued:
“It is noted that the mother, on receipt of the draft report on C from Dr A [the psychologist who had diagnosed C’s condition], sent correspondence asking Dr A to include in the report a statement that C is suffering because she is away from the mother. Dr A did not adopt the mother’s suggestion and emphasised the importance of staying neutral in these proceedings. Here is another example of this mother trying to assert and impose her view on professionals. It is a consistent trait.”
She described this as an example of the mother’s style of parenting as observed by independent social workers in the earlier proceedings, where she had been described as “an intense and anxious parent”.
With regard to B, the deputy district judge noted that the health issues to which the mother referred were “also not new”, although again there was now a diagnosis, in her case of coeliac disease. B had also suffered from a genital infection. Although it was described by her GP as being common in children, the mother had “suggested very strongly that the father’s application of the appropriate medication was deficient”. The deputy district judge also noted issues raised by the mother about B’s health and behaviour at school, although adding that the school itself “does not appear overly concerned” and that she was doing well at school. She observed, however, that the mother presented B’s behaviours as worrying and should require her to spend more time with the mother. A also has some health issues and nervous habits but was seen as doing very well at school where the issues raised by the mother were not seen as problematic.
The deputy district judge then turned to another element in the mother’s case, namely the role played by nannies when the children were with the father. In particular, the mother complained that the father was in breach of the recital to the 2019 order. On this matter the judge said (paragraph 12):
“It is a theme of the mother’s complaint and the mother’s way of consistently blaming the father for any difficulties attaching to the children that the father is delegating too much care for the children to the nannies. This includes the father allowing a nanny to collect the children from school when she relies on a recital in the order from 2019 to the effect that if the father is unable to collect the children from school it should be the mother who undertakes this task and not a nanny. As this was the order which I approved after hearing evidence and giving a judgment in 2019 I am in a good position to say that the mother has been unrealistic about how it should be used. Disallowing the nannies to undertake collection duties from school when the children are spending time with their father was not the intention of the recital. Nevertheless the mother roundly accuses the father of breaching the order by so doing. The second point of significant concern was that the mother contacted Ofsted about an issue she had with one of the nannies. This resulted in a letter from Ofsted to the nanny which can only have caused considerable concern for this nanny.”
She continued (paragraph 13):
“This mother has never accepted the decision that the children should spend equal time with both of their parents. This was the decision that I made in 2019. In 2021 Mr Recorder Trowell heard the application – including an application to relocate with the girls to Ireland. He maintained the child arrangements that they should spend equal time with each parent. Two ISWs have spent time considering this case and five days of court time have been used to consider the same issues. A total of three judgments have been contained in the bundle going over these issues as they presented in 2019 and 2021.”
Turning to the factors in the statutory welfare checklist, the deputy district judge first referred to the children’s wishes and feelings. The mother had argued that a s.7 report was necessary to gauge their current wishes about the arrangements for their care, some time having passed since previous inquiries. The deputy district judge observed:
“These children are aged between 5 and 10. They are currently spending equal time with each parent. Their wishes and feelings have been ascertained already within these proceedings on two occasions. In my judgment there is no further assessment to be carried out and to investigate matters again could be harmful for them. It is inconceivable that any social worker is going to try to find out if they would prefer a different division of time as this is an adult decision or, in lieu of parents agreeing, a decision of the court.”
She referred to the other factors in the checklist and concluded that none of them warranted a further s.7 report. In doing so, she observed that the children had not suffered any harm that warranted yet another investigation. There were no safeguarding issues and, in her judgment, no outstanding welfare issues. She added (paragraph 16):
“Two experienced ISWs have reported on these children in the last four years. Inevitably, such reporting is intrusive into the girls’ lives. In my judgment no further report is necessary and I am not going to order one.”
She referred to the overriding objective in FPR 1.1 and noted the court time which had already been used for consideration of these children’s welfare needs. She also recorded that the costs in the case were “breathtaking … £1.6 million.” She concluded (paragraph 18):
“The issue before the court is the amount of time the children should spend with each parent. In my judgment the applications made by the mother have gone far enough. She is attempting to re-litigate matters that have been decided (res judicata) and not overturned on appeal. This is not an appropriate use of family funds and continuing such litigation is not a proportionate use of the court’s time.”
Turning to the father’s application for an order under s.91(14), the deputy district judge referred to the decisions of this Court in Re P (A Minor) (Residence Order: Child’s Welfare) [2000] Fam 15 and Re A (A Child) (Supervised Contact) (s91(14) Children Act 1989 Orders) [2021] EWCA Civ 1749. In the latter case, King LJ had stated, at paragraph 41:
“in many cases, but particularly in those cases where the judge  forms the view that the type of behaviour indulged in by one of the parents amounts to ‘lawfare’, that is to say the use of the court proceedings as a weapon of conflict, the court may feel significantly less reluctance than has been the case hitherto, before stepping in to provide by the making of an order under s91(14), protection for  a parent from what is in effect, a form of coercive control on their former partner’s part.”
After referring to the decided cases, the deputy district judge continued:
“unfortunately, the mother in this case has been carrying out such a campaign which can be seen by her statement prepared for this hearing as well as the highlighted attempts she has made to get professionals to add to their views that the children’s welfare would be better served if they spent more time with their mother. She sets out a catalogue of complaints about the father’s parenting and his use of nannies. Her tone creates the impression that her children are being harmed almost daily when that is not the position that can be seen from the children’s school reports. All of this is designed and aimed in order for her to argue that the children should spend the majority of their time with her and see their father for alternate weekends with one sleepover in the intervening week. Her complaints are clear examples of evidence gathering as was her effort to persuade Dr A to amend his report to suggest that the reason for C’s behaviour was all about the separation from her mother. This was not his / her view and Dr A was at pains to remain neutral.”
She described the mother as “engaging in evidence-gathering and is weaponizing the evidence she gathers”. She described the mother’s actions as “not child-focused” and added that “the volume and intensity of the complaints is out of the ordinary”. She concluded:
“I am entirely satisfied that this is one of those unusual cases where it would be right to impose a s 91(14) order in order to give the children a break from litigation.”
The first appeal
The mother filed a notice of appeal against the judge’s order putting forward the following grounds:
The judge was wrong summarily to dismiss the mother’s application to vary the child arrangements order and refuse to order a s.7 report in the context of a material change in circumstances and serious concerns about the children’s welfare and the current child arrangements not meeting the children’s welfare needs.
The judge was wrong to refuse a s.7 report, thus resulting in a gap in the evidence particularly in respect of the children’s wishes and feelings.
The judge was wrong to make findings against the mother without her being put on notice or having the opportunity to give evidence; furthermore, there was no evidential or factual basis upon which for the court to make such findings, which are unsafe.
The judge was wrong to refuse to allow the mother to disclose recital C of the 2019 order.
The judge was wrong to make a s.91(14) order against the mother for three years when the Cafcass safeguarding letter did not recommend this, where previous applications had been reasonable and also made by the father, and were genuine attempts to further the welfare of the children and where the section 91(14) prohibition is disproportionate to the harm it is seeking to avoid.
On 15 May 2024, permission to appeal was granted by HH Judge Harris. In a short judgment, she made some observations about the merits of the appeal on which the mother subsequently relied and which were considered in the appeal judgment as described below.
The appeal hearing took place before HH Judge Robertson on 19 July 2024. The parties were represented by the same counsel as before the deputy district judge. Judgment was reserved and handed down on 26 July.
Having briefly summarised the background, the judge set out the legal principles to be applied by an appellate court. She also cited case law concerning case management in family cases, including the observations of Sir James Munby P in Re C (Children) (Residence Order: Application being dismissed at the Fact Finding Stage) [2012] EWCA Civ 1489 (which I shall consider later in this judgment).
On the first ground of appeal, the judge recorded that Dr Proudman for the mother had taken her to all the evidence she relied on to show that there had been a change in circumstances since the previous proceedings. She concluded, however, that there was nothing in that evidence which led her to conclude that the deputy district judge’s analysis was wrong. She recorded, in particular with regard to B, that she could see why HH Judge Harris, when granting permission to appeal, might have felt that there were new and troubling matters which should have been investigated, but concluded that there was more evidence which had been considered by the deputy district judge and that, on the balance of that evidence, it was not unreasonable or wrong for her to conclude that B’s difficulties were not so very different from how they had been in 2019 or 2021 and that they therefore did not need further investigation. There had been one development since the hearing before the deputy district judge on which the mother relied, namely that C had been excluded from school and had moved to another school. The judge noted that the mother had adduced no evidence about this, relying only on submissions, and the father had sought permission to file a report from the new school, which the judge refused. She concluded:
“The issue raised is merely another example of an issue where the mother claims there is a concern and the father produces a school report to refute it. DDJ O’Leary already had several such examples: another one would have been unlikely to change anything.”
The judge’s conclusion on ground 1 was set out in paragraph 28 of her judgment:
“If there had been no balancing positive information before the court then it may well have been that the learned judge was over-robust in dismissing the application without seeking further investigation of the issues raised by the mother. But taken in the round, with the positive evidence considered alongside the mother’s concerns, it appears to me that there was both evidence and reason for the learned judge to believe that the situation was not as the mother presented it. The learned judge at first instance had read all of the evidence and was well aware of the father’s balancing evidence. In those circumstances, and bearing in mind her very wide case management powers (including her power under PFR 22(1) to control evidence) and her obligations under the overriding objective, I cannot say she was wrong to come to the view that there had not been a material change of circumstances, and I cannot say she was wrong to refuse a s7 report. I make it plain that in coming to that conclusion I have considered the individual assertions made by the mother, but also as a separate exercise I have considered whether, taken together, the totality of them make a significant change. They do not. The totality of the positive evidence counteracts [the] totality of the negative.”
Turning to ground 2, the judge noted that it is widely accepted that unnecessary professional intervention in a child’s life can be harmful. The question was whether in this particular case further investigation was necessary to close a gap in the evidence. She agreed that, “with the lapse of three years, the children’s wishes and feelings were somewhat out of date”. On the other hand, they were still “fairly young”. Furthermore,
“The question they would have been asked was a very narrow one, namely whether there should be a different division of time. The learned judge described that as an adult decision. HHJ Harris disagreed and said that was a misstatement of the law. I respectfully disagree with HHJ Harris about that. In my view it is established law that the parents, or in default, the court will made decisions about the time the children spend with each parent. The children’s wishes and feelings are part of that decision but they are only a part.”
She noted that there were no safeguarding concerns, that according to the school reports the children were all doing well, and that there had already been two full hearings. She concluded that the deputy district judge was entitled to come to the view that she had enough information.
In respect of ground three – that the deputy district judge had been wrong to make findings against the mother – the judge (at paragraph 35) carefully went through the particular complaints raised by Dr Proudman. She cited the complaint that the judge had been wrong to say that the mother had contacted Cafcass after the safeguarding letters to make further complaints about the father and that she had in fact been seeking to clarify information. The judge described this as being “flatly contradicted by the Cafcass record” and referred to a collection of emails sent by the mother to the GP which were “either directly critical about the father or which exhibit passive aggression towards him”. Having cited examples, she concluded that the deputy district judge
“had evidence, and was entitled to come to the view she did, that this form of behaviour is not a one-off, but is a feature of the way the mother behaves.”
Of the mother’s statement filed in these proceedings, Judge Robertson observed that:
“over 37 paragraphs, the majority of them focus on things she says the father has done wrong. It is entirely fair to say her evidence is a litany of complaints about the father.”
She rejected the submission that the deputy district judge had been wrong to say that the mother does not accept what she is told by professionals. She continued (paragraph 36):
“There are other so-called “findings” which the mother seeks to challenge. I have considered them all, but will not in this judgment attempt to go through them all. There is, however, a procedural point which I must deal with, and that is the point made by the mother that these “findings” should never have been made at all in circumstances where the mother was not on notice of them, and had no opportunity to bring evidence against them and to cross-examine on the evidence which was relied on. I do not accept that argument from the mother. These observations made by DDJ O’Leary are not “findings” in the formal sense. It is the role, and indeed the duty, of the judge to come to a view about the character of a case and the character of a witness, and to express those views. Expressing those views does not amount to making formal “findings”. I consider that the comments made by the learned judge about the mother amount to her observations and views on the mother’s character and propensities. If every such observation had to be withheld until separate evidence was brought forward and cross examined upon, courts would grind to a halt. It would not be proportionate, nor would it be in the interests of justice for judges to be unable to express their views until such a process was complete (always providing those judges’ views are based on an acceptable level of evidence).”
The judge cited an observation by Recorder Trowell in the 2021 judgment that the mother’s general approach was “to assume she is right, that he is wrong, and the problem would disappear if only the court would have (as she believes it should have done) entrusted her with the primary care of her children”. The judge continued (paragraph 38):
“This was the judicial view, unchallenged at the time, which formed the backdrop against which DDJ O’Leary made her own observations. DDJ O’Leary was entitled to rely on that. Having looked at the mother’s individual complaints in relation to this appeal, three of which I have set out in detail above, I consider that there was evidence and information to support DDJ O’Leary’s observations. I further consider that it would have been disproportionate and not in keeping with the overriding objective for further evidence to be called before the judge was permitted to express the views she did.”
She then considered a further point made on behalf of the mother, that the deputy district judge had been wrong to accept wholesale the father’s narrative and reject the mother’s. In this context she acknowledged that the judge had wrongly ascribed to the mother the complaint that the father had thrown water at A – a complaint which had in fact emanated from the school. She accepted that the deputy district judge may have accepted rather more of the father’s narrative than the mother’s. She continued:
“However, in my view she had cause to do this. She was not dealing with a blank canvas. She had dealt with the case fully in 2019 and she had read the full judgment from the case in 2021. She was aware of the findings about the mother which I have referred to in this judgment, and her propensity to seek to influence professionals. She knew that many complaints about the father had emanated from the mother, as I have set out above. She had also come to a view about the mother seeking to portray the children as being harmed when the school reports provided evidence that they were not being harmed. In my view the learned judge was entitled to come to these views on the basis of previous findings and the existing evidence. She may have been mistaken as to the mother making a particular complaint to the local authority but that does not undermine her general approach.”
On ground 4, the judge noted that the deputy district judge had not specifically referred to the mother’s application to disclose the terms of the recital to the 2019 order to the school, but concluded that it was plain from the judgment that it was being refused. She found that this was the only sensible course for the judge in circumstances where the recital, which was a distillation of something agreed by the parties in 2019, was no longer agreed.
In respect of ground 5 – relating to the order under s.91(14) – the judge noted that the deputy district judge had referred herself to the correct case law, the effect of which was that orders under the subsection “are no longer to be seen as a weapon of last resort, and that the test to be applied is the welfare of the child”. Having upheld the deputy district judge’s decision that the mother’s evidence was “a litany of complaints”, she further upheld her description of those activities as “lawfare”. She noted that she had been considering, for the third time, the same arguments about spending time arrangements for the girls. She concluded:
“In my view the learned judge stayed on the right side of the line in this case, by applying the overriding objective, considering issues of proportionality, controlling the evidence as she saw fit, and making the decision that she did in a case which she considered, rightly, to be res judicata.”
The second appeal
On 28 August 2024, the mother filed a notice of appeal to this Court, acting in person. On 26 September, a skeleton argument was filed in support, drafted by Dr Proudman. On 8 November, I granted permission to appeal.
Five grounds of appeal were advanced, in similar but slightly different terms from those put forward at the first appeal. They were as follows:
The judge erred in concluding that there was no error in summarily dismissing the mother’s application for a child arrangements order and a s.7 report when there was evidence of a material change in the children’s circumstances; the consequence was a draconian decision which, even allowing for a wide ambit of discretion, was outside the parameters of fair decision-making.
The judge was wrong to place limited or no weight on the need to ascertain the child’s wishes and feelings, pursuant to s.1(3) of the Children Act 1989, and instead, relying on outdated wishes and feelings.
The judge’s approach in summarily dismissing mother’s application deprived her of the proper opportunity to answer the case against her and deprived the court of evidence that was necessary to enable it to make reliable and sound findings of fact.
The judge was wrong in refusing to allow disclosure of the relevant extracts to the school from both the 2019 and 2021 orders, which was for the benefit of the children’s welfare and further to a request made by the school.
The judge erred in the application of s.91(14) in making findings about the mother’s conduct whilst depriving her of the right to respond, thus the findings made were on a procedurally improper basis, and the child’s welfare did not require such an order.
In the event, the mother was represented at the appeal hearing before us by Mr Dorian Day who relied and expanded on the submissions in Dr Proudman’s skeleton argument. He identified the cornerstone of the mother’s case as being a challenge to the summary determination of issues at an early stage of proceedings with limited evidence. That moved, he said, into the wider issues of proceeding without any updated welfare evidence in the form of a s.7 report and of the court’s ability to make decisions under the welfare checklist absent evidence about the children’s current wishes and feelings.
As in the lower court hearings, the mother’s fundamental case was that the children’s circumstances required the court to change the arrangements for their care. Two of the children have special needs and all three are seeing a therapist. Although some of the children’s difficulties were known to the parties and the courts in the earlier proceedings, the extent of their problems had only become evident since 2021. In particular, there have now been clear diagnoses of coeliac disease in B and ASD in C. C has also been excluded from school. Extensive submissions as to the children’s complex needs were made to the deputy district judge and reiterated to Judge Robertson. Both judges had failed to recognise that these complexities required a fresh assessment by the court. In reaching that conclusion, they erred in attaching excessive weight to positive comments in the children’s school reports. They had failed to attach weight to the strong evidence that the children were unsettled by the repeated transitions from one parent to the other and the uncertainty that arose as to who would be taking and collecting them from school.
The deputy district judge had wrongly concluded that there was no justification in making fresh inquiries as to the children’s wishes and feelings. At the time of the earlier proceedings, the children were of an age and level of understanding where little weight would be attached to their wishes and they had not been asked about their views as to the arrangements for their care. They were now at an age at which greater weight should be attributed to their expressed views.
It was submitted on behalf of the mother that the deputy district judge had been wrong to make findings against the mother at the DRA. She had reached conclusions on disputed, polarised allegations at a dispute resolution hearing without allowing the mother a fair opportunity to respond. It was unfair to find that the mother was “weaponising” issues and had engaged in “lawfare” without conducting a full hearing on evidence.  She had wrongly proceeded on the basis that it was the mother who had always raised concerns when in fact in some instances it had been the schools. It was submitted that Judge Harris had been correct when granting permission to appeal to conclude (as she said in the short judgment delivered on granting permission) that the deputy district judge “went too far in a hearing dealt with on submissions, by effectively accepting all of the father’s characterisation of the situation and rejecting all of the mother’s”. In accepting the father’s case, the deputy district judge had clearly made findings and Judge Robertson had been wrong to describe them as merely observations.
Mr Day submitted that the deputy district judge had been wrong to make a s.91(14) order against the mother. The earlier proceedings had been concluded with no adverse criticism of her conduct of the litigation. The current application was made because the mother was genuinely concerned that the current arrangements were having an adverse impact on the children. Furthermore, the “findings” on which the deputy district judge relied when making the order were unfair and contrary to the assessment carried out by the same judge four years earlier. There had been no balance in the deputy district judge’s analysis on this application. She overlooked the fact that the father had made applications which he had withdrawn.
These arguments were countered by persuasive submissions from Ms Fottrell. By the hearing in November 2023, there had been, in the previous four years, two sets of proceedings with fully contested hearings conducted by two judges who had each concluded that the broadly equal division of time was the right arrangement for the children. For that reason, the starting point for the deputy district judge was whether there had been a change of circumstances relating to the children’s welfare that justified re-opening the child arrangements order. To that end, when giving case management directions on 6 September 2023, she had ordered the mother to file a statement “setting out the events and changes in circumstances since June 2021 in support of her application for a variation of the current child arrangements orders”. In response, the mother filed a statement, with extensive exhibits, in which she sought to make a good case about B’s health, C’s ASD diagnosis, the issues about the use of nannies, and complaints against the father. Having considered that evidence, together with the evidence in response from the father and extensive submissions from both parties, the deputy district judge concluded that no further court investigation was required and there was no requirement to make inquiries as to the children’s wishes and feelings.
Ms Fottrell emphasised that this was a second appeal following a first appeal at which the judge had conducted a clear, detailed, thorough and robust review of the deputy district judge’s decision, in the course of which she read all the evidence and the transcripts of the hearings. Judge Robertson’s characterisation of the deputy district judge’s comments about the mother as “observations” rather than formal findings was correct. She had been right to endorse the decision to make a s.91(14) order, partly on the basis of those observations but also because the children plainly needed a break in the litigation.
Discussion and conclusion
It is well recognised that litigation about children following the breakdown of their parents’ relationship often exacerbates the harm they have suffered as a result of that breakdown. Strenuous efforts are devoted to encouraging parents to resolve such disputes without resorting to the court. These efforts continue after proceedings have started. A crucial stage is the DRA. The purpose of a DRA is to try to resolve the issues without a contested final hearing. Within the Family Procedure Rules, Practice Direction 12B, paragraph 19(3) requires the court at the DRA to “identify the key issues (if any) to be determined and the extent to which those issues can be resolved or narrowed at the DRA” and to “consider whether the DRA can be used as a final hearing”.
Even where the parties are unable to reach an agreement, the court has the power to bring the proceedings to an end if satisfied that such a course is consistent with the welfare of the children, which under s.1 of the 1989 Act is the paramount consideration whenever the court is determining any question about the children’s upbringing. In Re C (Children) (Residence Order: Application being dismissed at the Fact Finding Stage) [2012] EWCA Civ 1489, this Court dismissed an appeal against a judge’s decision reached after an abbreviated hearing of the evidence. In that case, a father was seeking to overturn a residence order in respect of his three children on the basis of allegations about the mother’s day-to-day care of the children. After the father’s evidence in chief, however, the judge halted the evidence and after submissions delivered judgment dismissing the application. In giving the lead judgment dismissing the appeal, Sir James Munby made the following observations about case management in family cases:
…. It has long been recognised -- and authority need not be quoted for this proposition -- that for this reason a judge exercising the family jurisdiction has a much broader discretion than he would in the civil jurisdiction to determine the way in which an application of the kind being made by the father should be pursued. In an appropriate case he can summarily dismiss the application as being, if not groundless, lacking enough merit to justify pursuing the matter. He may determine that the matter is one to be dealt with on the basis of written evidence and oral submissions without the need for oral evidence. He may, as Judge Cliffe did in the present case, decide to hear the evidence of the applicant and then take stock of where the matter stands at the end of the evidence.
The judge in such a situation will always be concerned to ask himself: is there some solid reason in the interests of the children why I should embark upon, or, having embarked upon, why I should continue exploring the matters which one or other of the parents seeks to raise. If there is or may be solid advantage in the children in doing so, then the inquiry will proceed, albeit it may be on the basis of submissions rather than oral evidence. But if the judge is satisfied that no advantage to the children is going to be obtained by continuing the investigation further, then it is perfectly within his case management powers and the proper exercises of his discretion so to decide and to determine that the proceedings should go no further.
…
It is pre-eminently a matter for the trial judge in a case of this sort to determine the form of procedure which will best meet the welfare needs of the children. A judge is not obliged, merely because one parent or the other wishes him to do so, to listen to evidence if it has become apparent to him that the process is not going to be of any advantage to the children. That was the view Judge Cliffe took. It was a robust view, but it is quite impossible, in my judgment, to assert that the judge, in taking that view and adopting that approach, exceeded the generous ambit of discretion which the law conferred upon him as the trial judge.”
It follows that a court is not obliged to hold a fact-finding hearing just because one party is asking for one. Indeed, the court should only hold a fact-finding hearing where findings are necessary before making decisions about the children’s future. In K v K [2022] EWCA Civ 468, this Court gave guidance on the proper approach to fact-finding hearings in private family proceedings following its earlier decision in Re H-N [2021] EWCA Civ 44 (paragraph 65):
“A fact-finding hearing is not free-standing litigation. It always takes place within proceedings to protect a child from abuse or regarding the child’s future welfare. It is not to be allowed to become an opportunity for the parties to air their grievances. Nor is it a chance for parents to seek the court’s validation of their perception of what went wrong in their relationship. If fact-finding is to be justified in the first place or continued thereafter, the court must be able to identify how any alleged abusive behaviour is, or may be, relevant to the determination of the issues between the parties as to the future arrangements for the children.”
That guidance was given in a case involving allegations of domestic abuse. But it applies to all occasions when a court is considering whether to hold a fact-finding hearing in a private children’s case. A fact-finding hearing should only be held where the findings are, or may be, relevant to the determination of the issues about the future child arrangements.
That approach continues throughout the proceedings and after they have come to an end. Not infrequently in private children’s proceedings, a party who is dissatisfied with the outcome of a hearing tries to get it changed at a later date by bringing another application. In DP v PC [2017] EWHC 2387 (Fam), I said (at paragraph 36):
“where there has been a contested hearing relatively recently at which the issues have been properly and fully ventilated … if a parent then returns to court and seeks to reopen the issue, then it is likely that a court will take the view that there should be no further extensive investigation, unless there has been a significant or material change in circumstances.”
As it happened, in that case I concluded that the judge had been wrong to dismiss the second application summarily because the earlier application had been withdrawn without a full hearing. But in cases such as the one we are dealing with on this appeal, when there have been previous proceedings relatively recently – in this case two sets of proceedings – in which judges have made orders after delivering judgments following contested hearings, it is likely that the court will decide that there should be no further investigation unless there has been a significant or material change in circumstances.
I accept the submission made by Ms Fottrell that, where parties have been in proceedings for several years, it is incumbent on any judge to look carefully at the necessity of permitting a party to reopen matters which have been extensively litigated, particularly where the court is concerned about the detrimental effect of the litigation on the children. Such an approach is entirely consistent with the case management responsibility of the first instance judge.
In the present case, there had been two contested hearings in the previous four years. In her ISW report for the second proceedings in 2021, Ms X had found that the children “were in need of stability in their young lives” and that “moving them from their daily routines would be destabilising for them”. The recorder had accepted her recommendation that there should be no substantial change in the child arrangements order.  Both Deputy District Judge O’Leary and Judge Robertson concluded that there had not been a change of circumstances sufficient to justify a further full investigation by the court. In oral submissions, Mr Day suggested that, whether or not there had been a significant change of circumstances, the girls’ circumstances now were sufficiently troubling to require a further investigation. In my view, where there has been no material change in circumstances since the previous fully-contested hearing, it is difficult to envisage (in the words of Sir James Munby P in Re C) any “solid reason in the interests of the children” for embarking on an exploration of the matters which one or other of the parents seeks to raise, in particular where that would involve exposing the children to the disruption of a further s.7 investigation. Although there had plainly been some developments in the girls’ lives, in particular B and C, I am not persuaded that the deputy district judge was wrong to hold that they did not amount to a change of circumstances sufficient to demand further investigation by the court.
It is important to note that the mother’s application was of a relatively limited scope. She was seeking a variation of the child arrangements order so that the time the father spent with the children was reduced from seven days a fortnight to four with an equivalent change in the division of school holidays. She was also seeking an order for the disclosure of the recital to the 2019 order to the school. Taken together or separately, these issues did not themselves inevitably require the court to seek a s.7 report. Nor did they inevitably require a full hearing with oral evidence. They were issues which on which a judge exercising her case management powers might fairly conclude could be sensibly and proportionately determined on submissions.
It is also important to note that the order under appeal here was not a summary dismissal of the mother’s application without consideration of the evidence. Although there was no oral evidence, there was extensive written evidence. The deputy district judge had directed the mother to file a statement setting out the changes in circumstances since June 2021 in support of her case for a variation of the current child arrangements. In consequence, the court was supplied with a statement, including extensive exhibits, and detailed submissions on behalf of the mother seeking to identify developments in the children’s lives which required further investigation by the court. Having read that material, plus the father’s statement in reply and exhibits, and the two safeguarding letters from Cafcass, and considered comprehensive oral submissions, all in the context of the two earlier judgments, the deputy district judge concluded that no further investigation was required and indeed might be harmful to the children.
The mother has not identified any factor which would justify this Court interfering with the deputy district judge’s decision. That conclusion was plainly within her discretion, and one which she was in a strong position to reach having conducted the first contested hearing in 2019.  This is an appellate court and, as Ms Fottrell reminded us, we must keep in our lane. As Sir James said in Re C, this was “pre-eminently a matter for the trial judge … to determine the form of procedure which will best meet the welfare needs of the children”. As in that case, it is “quite impossible” to assert that the deputy district judge, in taking that view and adopting that approach, exceeded the generous ambit of discretion which the law conferred upon her.
In those circumstances, there is no merit in the ground of appeal concerning the children’s wishes and feelings. As the deputy district judge was entitled to conclude that there had been no material change after two previous investigations in the preceding four years, and thus no solid ground for embarking on a further investigation, there was no welfare issue on which their wishes needed to be canvassed. In any event, I agree with the approach of both judges to the issue of the children’s wishes and feelings. As Judge Robertson observed, the issue in the case was “a very narrow one, namely whether there should be a different division of time”. That was “an adult decision” in which the children’s wishes and feelings are “only a part”. Furthermore, as the deputy district judge observed, investigations under s.7 are intrusive into children’s lives. They are not to be ordered unless necessary to resolve an issue about a child’s welfare. As Ms Fottrell reminded us, s.7 is a permissive provision. No report should be ordered under s.7 unless it is necessary to resolve the issues. There had already been two detailed ISW reports in the preceding four years. In this case, there was no recommendation for a s.7 investigation in the Cafcass safeguarding letters. In those circumstances, having considered the relevant factors in the statutory welfare checklist in s.1 of the 1989 Act, the deputy district judge was fully entitled to conclude the proceedings without ordering a report.
In considering the challenge in ground 3 to the criticisms of the mother which form the basis of the third ground of appeal, it must be recalled that the deputy district judge was not dealing with a blank canvas. She had conducted the first hearing in 2019. She had read the recorder’s judgment from 2021 in which he had found that the mother attributed problems in the children’s behaviour to the father’s day-to-day parenting, that her general approach was to assume that she was right and he was wrong and that she thought that “the problem would disappear if only the court would have (as she believes it should have done) entrusted her with the primary care of the children”. In his judgment, the recorder had tempered these criticisms of the mother by acknowledging that she recognised that the father loved the children and they loved him and that he was important to them. But the deputy district judge was entitled to take account of the criticisms when considering the mother’s renewed application for a variation of the child arrangements order.
Where a judge at a DRA concludes that the evidence and arguments put forward by the mother indicated that she was continuing to make allegations against the father with the aim of achieving a change in the child arrangements order in the manner criticised by the recorder in an earlier judgment only two years earlier, and that there is nothing to warrant further investigation sought by the mother, the judge is entitled to record her conclusion that the mother has continued to conduct herself in the same way. It would be wholly disproportionate, and contrary to the children’s welfare, for the judge to be precluded from taking that course without a full hearing.
At a DRA, when deciding whether or not there should be a further investigation and full hearing, a judge has to assess the information put before her. Pragmatically, that cannot be confined to agreed evidence. When deciding whether it is in the interests of the child to authorise a full court investigation or to conclude the proceedings at the DRA, the court is not obliged to disregard any piece of contested evidence and only take into account matters that are agreed between the parties. That would undermine the court’s powers to control and conduct proceedings in accordance with the paramountcy of the child’s welfare. The judge has to consider the information put before her, recognise that it is not necessarily the complete picture and in some respects contested, and come to a view as to whether a full court investigation is necessary and proportionate. Where the judge concludes that such an investigation is neither necessary nor proportionate, she will often proceed on a basis that in some respects is not accepted by all the parties and has not been the subject of findings.
Of course, there is a limit to the circumstances in which a court can properly and fairly proceed in that way. It will turn on the details of the contested issues and the proposed outcome. At one extreme, for example, where a party is alleging that the other parent has sexually abused the child and that as a result all contact should be supervised, it will be difficult if not impossible for the court to make a final order without making formal findings about the allegations. But where the proposal is for a less radical adjustment of the child arrangements order, it will often be open to the court to reach a conclusion without a fully contested hearing. This is a decision which can largely be left to the skill and experience of the family judge without appellate interference.
In this case, the deputy district judge decided to proceed to a final order on the basis of the information put before her at the DRA. In giving her reasons, she expressed views about that information, including views that were critical of the mother. As Judge Robertson remarked, the “observations” made by the deputy district judge were not “findings” in the formal sense. They were based on the earlier findings made by the recorder and the extensive new evidence put before the deputy district judge by both parties. I agree with Judge Robertson that it would have been disproportionate and not in keeping with the overriding objective for further evidence to be called before the judge was permitted to express the views she did. Judge Robertson was right to point out that the deputy district judge may have been in error in at least one respect in ascribing to the mother a complaint that had emanated from the school. Like Judge Robertson, however, I do not consider this invalidates the deputy district judge’s approach or decision. Any such error was immaterial. Given her own experience of the case in 2019, and the criticisms of the mother made by the recorder in 2021 – expressed in measured but clear terms – and her reading of the evidence put before her, she was entitled to make the observations she did about the mother.
There is no merit in the fourth ground of appeal. As Having made the original order, the deputy district judge was in a good position to construe its meaning. She observed that “disallowing the nannies to undertake collection duties from school [during the periods] when the children are spending time with their father was not the intention of the recital.” Thus the application to disclose the recital to the school with a view to the mother undertaking collection duties during those periods was misconceived.
Finally, there is the order under s.91(14). This order does not impose a complete bar on applications. It requires the party to obtain the court’s leave before any application is made. As Ms Fottrell pointed out, guidance as to the circumstances in which such an order is appropriate is set out in the Family Procedure Rules at Practice Direction 12B, paragraph 13A:
“[The subsection] leaves a discretion to the court to determine the circumstances in which an order should be made. These circumstances may be many and varied. They include circumstances where an application would put the child concerned, or another individual, at risk of harm … such as psychological or emotional harm. The welfare of the child is paramount.”
The Practice Direction makes it clear that the circumstances can also include “where one party has made repeated and unreasonable applications” and “where a period of respite is needed following litigation”.
The decision to make an order under s.91(14) in this case falls squarely within the guidance in the Practice Direction and the case law cited in the judgments, in particular Re A, supra. It was manifestly within the discretion of the deputy district judge to conclude that the order was justified by reason of the mother’s conduct and the need to give the children a break from litigation.
Three further points arise. First, a further argument not identified in the grounds of appeal was tentatively advanced by Mr Day in oral submissions. He pointed out that, when launching this latest application, the mother had filed a form C1A. This is the form which has to be filed alongside the originating application, and/or the acknowledgement filed by the respondent, when a party asserts that there are allegations that the children may have suffered or be at risk of suffering abuse. In the form, the mother had made some allegations about the father’s behaviour and its impact on the children. Mr Day sought to argue that the approach and judgments of the courts below were deficient because neither judge had considered the form C1A. As I understood his point, he was submitting that there had been a failure to comply with the court’s obligations under Practice Direction 12J. When it was pointed out to him that this alleged omission was not mentioned in the notice of appeal to this Court, he agreed to “move on”. Following the hearing, the mother herself sent an email to the Civil Appeals Office (copied to the father’s representatives) enclosing a copy of the position statement filed for the hearing before the deputy district judge which included reference to the C1A form and the allegations therein. I have therefore re-read the transcripts of the hearings before the deputy district judge and the judge to check whether there was any omission of the sort suggested. Some of the specific matters mentioned in the form C1A were referred to in the hearings – for example, the father’s alleged failures to obtain treatment for some of the children’s conditions, and the complaint that the father threw water over A to encourage her to get out of bed. But so far as I can see, neither judge was invited to treat these matters as abuse. Indeed, at one point during the first appeal before Judge Robertson (transcript, page 34), Dr Proudman submitted that the issues which may warrant investigation were whether the current arrangement is suiting the children “because of their particular needs, not because of any deficiency in parenting on the part of the father”. In the circumstances, it is unsurprising that the complaint raised by Mr Day at the hearing about the failure to address the allegations of harm in form C1A did not feature in the grounds of appeal to Judge Robertson or to this Court.
Secondly, a number of submissions made on behalf of the mother, in particular in the skeleton argument, were based on observations made by HH Judge Harris in her short judgment granting permission to appeal from the deputy district judge. In my view, it is rarely if ever appropriate for an appellate court to attach weight to observations made when granting permission to appeal. A judge considering an application for permission to appeal is engaged on a different exercise from the court hearing the full appeal, namely assessing whether there is a real prospect that the appeal will succeed or some other compelling reason for the appeal to be heard. He or she may point out potential flaws in the trial judge’s decisions and reasons but should avoid making any definitive comments on them. A judge considering an application for permission to appeal will rarely have access to all of the material available to the appellate court. All judges sitting at an appellate level regularly find that an appeal which seemed strong when granting permission looks completely different after hearing arguments canvassed at the appeal hearing. In this case, the fact that Judge Harris expressed criticisms of the deputy district judge’s judgment carried no weight before Judge Robertson and the fact that Judge Robertson departed from Judge Harris’ assessment adds no weight to the appeal before this Court.
Finally, whilst reaching the clear conclusion that the decisions at first instance and on the first appeal should be upheld, I would respectfully not endorse the judges’ characterisation of the matters which the mother was seeking to raise as “res judicata”. As Hale J observed nearly 30 years ago in Re B (Children Act Proceedings) (Issue Estoppel) [1997] 1 FLR 285 (at p295D):
“the weight of Court of Appeal authority is against the existence of any strict rule of issue estoppel which is binding upon any of the parties in children’s cases.”
She continued, however:
“At the same time, the court undoubtedly has a discretion as to how the inquiry before it is to be conducted. This means it may on occasion decline to allow a full hearing of the evidence on certain matters even if the strict rules of issue estoppel would not cover them.”
This illustrates that there is nothing new in the idea that judges have a discretion as to how to exercise their case management powers in children’s cases, although the obligations on judges when exercising that discretion to be rigorous in case management are now in sharper focus.
For the reasons set out above, I would dismiss this appeal.

Appellant
and
REGISTRAR OF APPROVED DRIVING INSTRUCTORS
Respondent
Representation:
For the Appellant: Mr Quegan, counsel
For the Respondent: Did not attend
Decision: The appeal is dismissed. The Registrar’s decision of 23 September 2022 is upheld.
REASONS
This appeal concerns a decision of the Registrar of Approved Driving Instructors (“the Registrar”) made on 23 September 2022 to remove the Appellant’s name from the Register of Approved Driving Instructors (the “Register”) on the grounds that the Appellant had ceased to be a fit and proper person to be an Approved Driving Instructor (“ADI”).
The proceedings were held by video (CVP). All parties joined remotely. The Tribunal was satisfied that it was fair and just to conduct the hearing in this way.  The Registrar did not attend the hearing.  The Tribunal had not been informed of this in advance, but Mr Quegan said that his instructing solicitors had been told the Registrar would not be attending.  We decided to proceed with the hearing on this basis.
The Appeal
The Appellant’s Notice of Appeal dated 21 October 2022 relies on the grounds that he wrongly accepted six penalty points for driving while uninsured.  He says that he was, in fact, insured to drive the relevant vehicle, and so there are exceptional circumstances which have not been considered by the Registrar.
The Registrar’s Statement of Case dated 21 November 2022 resists the appeal.  The Registrar says that he cannot ignore the fact the Appellant’s driving licence is endorsed with nine penalty points after having been convicted of two motoring offences.  The Appellant also failed to notify the Registrar of the second offence within seven days.  The Registrar says that he would be failing in his public duty if he allowed a person who had been convicted of these offences, and failed to declare when required to do so, to have his name retained in the Register.
This appeal was originally listed for a hearing on 4 April 2023.  The hearing was adjourned as the Appellant wished to consider making a late application to appeal the fixed penalty.  The Appellant’s solicitor gave an undertaking to keep the Tribunal informed of the progress with this application.  We have seen correspondence with the Procurator Fiscal’s Office, and confirmation from the Appellant’s solicitor in October 2023 that it was not possible to appeal the fixed penalty and so the hearing could go ahead.
The law
Conditions for entry and retention on the Register require the applicant to be and continue to be a “fit and proper person” to have his name on the Register – see sections 125(3) and 127(3)(e) of the Road Traffic Act 1988 (the “Act”).
The Registrar can remove a person’s name from the Register if they have ceased to be a fit and proper person to have their name on the Register (section 125(2)(e) of the Act). The Registrar may take the view that a person no longer meets this requirement where there has been a change in circumstances. The Registrar has the burden of showing that a person does not meet the statutory requirement to be a fit and proper person, and the standard of proof is the balance of probabilities.
The powers of the Tribunal in determining this appeal are set out in section 131 of the Act. The Tribunal may make such order as it thinks fit (section 131(3)). The Tribunal stands in the shoes of the Registrar and takes a fresh decision on the evidence available to it, giving appropriate weight to the Registrar’s decision as the person tasked by Parliament with making such decisions (in accordance with R. (Hope and Glory Public House Ltd) v City of Westminster Magistrates Court & Ors [2011] EWCA Civ 31).
In Harris v Registrar of Approved Driving Instructors [2010] EWCA Civ 808, the Court of Appeal described the “fit and proper person” condition as follows: “..the condition is not simply that the applicant is a fit and proper person to be a driving instructor, it is that he is a fit and proper person to have his name entered in the register. Registration carries with it an official seal of approval…It seems to me that the maintenance of public confidence in the register is important. For that purpose, the Registrar must be in a position to carry out his function of scrutiny effectively, including consideration of the implications of any convictions of an applicant or a registered ADI. This is why there are stringent disclosure requirements. [If an applicant or registered ADI fails to disclose convictions or makes a false declaration that he has no convictions, it strikes at the heart of the registration process and the reliability of the register. In my view such conduct is plainly relevant – indeed, highly relevant - to the question whether an applicant is a fit and proper person].” (paragraph 30).
The evidence
We have considered a bundle of evidence containing 323 numbered pages.   We heard evidence from the Appellant and heard submissions from Mr Quegan on his behalf.
The relevant facts
The Appellant’s name was first entered on the Register in February 2012.  On 7 June 2020 the Appellant applied for re-registration and informed the Registrar of a motoring conviction dated 16 December 2019 for exceeding a statutory speed limit on a public road for which he received three penalty points.  The Appellant had not previously informed the Registrar of this offence.  We understand that the application for re-registration includes a declaration which states that the applicant understands they must inform the Registrar within seven days of any convictions, including motoring offences.
On 12 August 2022, the Registrar was advised by DVLA Swansea that the Appellant had been convicted of two motoring offences.  The second offence was a fixed penalty of six points for using a vehicle uninsured against third party risks, on 12 June 2022. The Appellant had not informed the Registrar about this offence.  The Appellant was given the opportunity to make representations, which were considered by the Registrar.  In a letter dated 23 September 2022 the Registrar informed the Appellant that he had ceased to be a fit and proper person to remain on the Register because of the two fixed penalties.
The Appellant’s position is that the second offence on 12 June 2022 was an error.  He says that he took over driving his wife’s car, a VW Passat, as their infant child had become distressed.  He was stopped by the police while driving in Scotland, on the basis that the car did not have road tax. They were able to show that the car was taxed.  However, the Police Officer informed the Appellant that he was not insured to drive the vehicle.  This was on the basis that he was shown as the registered keeper of the car. The Appellant’s wife then explained that they had forgotten to change the logbook.  It was not possible for the police to contact the Appellant’s insurance company as it was a Sunday.  The police escorted them to the next service station, with the Appellant’s wife driving the car. The Appellant accepted what the Police Officer said at the time, but now believes this was wrong.
The Appellant later received a letter from the Procurator Fiscal which made a conditional offer of a fixed penalty.  The Appellant initially said that this letter offered him a choice of accepting the fixed penalty or imprisonment, and so he opted to pay the penalty.  He described this as a “no brainer” of accept six points or prison.  When directed to the letter in the bundle of documents, he changed this explanation to refer to prosecution rather than imprisonment.  The letter says that the Appellant had 28 days to pay £300 and accept six points on his licence as an alternative to prosecution.  It also says that if he accepted the fixed penalty that is final and they cannot enter into any discussion or review of the facts of the case.  There is no reference to imprisonment in the letter.
The Appellant did not contact his insurance company to check whether he was insured, either on 12 June 2022 or after receiving this letter.
The Appellant did not inform the Registrar of this conviction within seven days.  In fact, he did not inform the Registrar at all, and the Registrar only found out about the conviction after being contacted by the DVLA in August 2022.
The Appellant says in his appeal that he had transferred ownership of the car (the VW Passat) to his wife in June 2022 when he acquired a new car, but as an oversight had not made her the registered keeper of the car at the same time.  At the hearing he clarified that this new car had actually been purchased in 2019, meaning the alleged transfer of ownership did not happen at the same time.  The VW Passat car was covered by a motor insurance policy in the name of his wife.  The Appellant says that he had a fully comprehensive insurance policy at the time which allowed him to drive cars owned by another person with the owner’s permission.
We have seen a number of documents relating to the relevant vehicle and insurance policies for the Appellant and his wife.  The key documents are:
A certificate of motor insurance for the Appellant for a Toyota Yaris, from 27 July 2021 to 27 July 2022 (page 97).  This states that “The Policyholder may only drive other private motor cars not owned by him/her or hired to him/her under a rental, hire purchase or lease agreement”.
A motor policy schedule for the Appellant’s wife for a VW Passat, which is the vehicle the Appellant was driving on 12 June 2022 (page 127).  This provides insurance cover from 8 June 2022 to 8 August 2022. It does not state who owns this vehicle.
A summary of a motor insurance policy for the Appellant’s wife for a Ford Fiesta, from 8 August 2022 (page 152).  This names her sister as an additional driver.
The V5C form for the VW Passat, which shows the Appellant’s wife as the registered keeper of the car (page 167).  This shows on the front page, “Acquired vehicle on 12 06 2022”.
The Appellant argues that these documents show he had transferred the VW Passat car to his wife before 12 June 2022.  She took out insurance on the car from 8 June 2022.  He says that this is when he transferred ownership to her. Although she was not made the registered keeper until later, he argues that the V5C form is not proof of ownership – as shown clearly on the form itself with the words “This document is not proof of ownership”.
We asked the Appellant about completion of the V5C form.  He said that they initially tried to do this online on 12 June 2022.  However, his recollection was that this was not successful, and so they completed it later after returning from Scotland.  He was unable to explain clearly why this gives 12 June 2022 as the date his wife acquired the vehicle.
We have seen correspondence from the Procurator Fiscal to the Appellant’s solicitors about the offence from August 2023 (page 288).   This refers to the Appellant as “Mr Muhammad”.  The letter states:
“I have received information from the Reporting Officer in the case, which states that at the time Mr Muhammad was stopped by the police, he claimed ownership of the vehicle he was driving at that time and that the said vehicle was registered to him.
Checks showed that Mr Muhammad’s wife was the only insured driver for that vehicle.
When asked about insurance, Mr Muhammad advised that he was driving the vehicle under his own policy of insurance. Enquiries were carried out with the insurer, which confirmed that Mr Muhammad’s own insurance policy did not cover Mr Muhammad to drive that particular vehicle, due to it being owned by him.
There was no information at that time to indicate that the vehicle was owned by anyone else other than Mr Muhammad and the offence was duly reported.”
We have considered these facts, and find on the balance of probabilities that the Appellant was not insured to drive the VW Passat on 12 June 2022.  We accept that his insurance policy at the time allowed him to drive other cars that were not owned by him. However, we are not persuaded that there was an effective transfer of ownership of the car to the Appellant’s wife before that date.  She did have a policy of insurance on that car from 8 June 2022, which is consistent with the Appellant’s explanation that he had transferred the car to her.  The Appellant argues that this shows there was intent to transfer ownership on this date, and the Appellant would also be on the policy if he intended to retain the car. This policy does not show, however, that the Appellant’s wife was the owner of the car at that time.   During evidence at the hearing, the Appellant suggested that the VW Passat had not been used for some time, and he also said that another relative had previously been insured on it.  This indicates that holding insurance to drive the car did not necessarily mean that ownership was intended to be transferred to that person.
The V5C that was completed by the Appellant gives the date that his wife acquired the vehicle as 12 June 2022, not any earlier date.  We accept that this document is not proof of ownership.  However, the date on the document is evidence of when the Appellant said ownership had been transferred, as at the time of the events.  The information from the Procurator Fiscal indicates that Mr Khan said he was the owner of the car, and the insurer confirmed that he was not insured (although it is unclear how or when they confirmed this).  The Appellant says he told the police that his wife owned the car.  However, he did not contact the insurer at the time to confirm the position, or provide any evidence from the insurer at this hearing.  We accept that this was a somewhat confusing series of events.  However, on balance, we find that there is not sufficient evidence that ownership of the car had been transferred before 12 June 2022.  The only direct evidence from the time of the date when ownership was transferred is the date of 12 June 2022 which the Appellant and his wife put on the V5C form.
The Appellant accepts that he did not inform the Registrar within seven days about either of the motoring offences.  For the speeding offence, he says that he thought he could declare on re-registration (which he did).  At the time of the offence he was not working as an ADI.  The Appellant accepted at the hearing that he was aware of the declaration included on the re-registration form, that he must inform the Registrar within seven days of any convictions, including motoring offences.  Nevertheless, he did not inform the Registrar about the second offence.  His explanation is that he was a new parent and everything was in disorder, and he had a lot going on.  He denies having had any intention of hiding the offence.
Conclusions
The standing of the Register could be substantially diminished, and the public’s confidence undermined, if it were known that a person’s name had been allowed to remain on the Register when they had demonstrated behaviours substantially material to the question of fitness. This includes behaviour relating to driving and motoring offences.
ADIs are held to a higher standard than ordinary motorists. The public has the right to expect that those who are registered as ADIs adhere to the highest standards of motoring, which they themselves should be teaching to their pupils. Teaching people of all ages to drive safely, carefully and competently is a professional vocation requiring a significant degree of responsibility. Such a demanding task should only be entrusted to those with high personal and professional standards and who themselves have demonstrated a keen regard for road safety and compliance with the law.
The Appellant argues that there are exceptional circumstances in relation to the six-point penalty for driving while uninsured, as he did not in fact commit this offence.  However, we have found on the balance of probabilities that the Appellant was not insured at the time of the offence.  We accept that the Appellant may not have intended to drive while uninsured, but nevertheless, on the evidence we have considered, we find that he did do so.  He had a total of nine penalty points.  This does not meet the standard of driving that is expected of an ADI.
We have also considered the Appellant’s failure to declare the two motoring offences to the Registrar.  We accept that the first failure may have been a genuine error, as he was not actively working as an ADI at that time, and it involved a more minor speeding offence.  However, the second failure is more serious.  The Appellant had completed his re-registration in 2020, and confirmed that he was aware of the requirement.  We consider that he does not have a good explanation for this failure to declare.  We have some sympathy for the stresses involved in becoming a new parent, but do not consider that this is a sufficient excuse.  ADIs are trusted professionals who are required to keep the Registrar informed of any convictions so that the Registrar can be satisfied they are a fit and proper person to be on the Register. ADIs must prioritise this important responsibility. This was a serious motoring offence that was very relevant to the issue of fitness, and the Appellant failed to declare it.
Taking all of these matters into account, we find on the balance of probabilities that the Appellant does not currently meet the statutory requirement to be a fit and proper person.  He has nine penalty points, and our factual findings are that, on the balance of probabilities, he was not insured to drive the relevant car at the time of the second offence.  We are also very concerned by the failure to declare the second offence to the Registrar without any satisfactory explanation.  In all the circumstances, we conclude that the Registrar’s decision to remove the Appellant’s name from the Register as he was not a fit and proper person was correct. We dismiss this appeal.
The Appellant has remained on the Register pending the outcome of this appeal.  We confirm that our dismissal of the appeal means that he is removed from the Register and is no longer able to work as an ADI.
We note that the decision to remove the Appellant from the Register is not permanent. He may be able to re-apply once the penalty points have expired and if he can show that he now fully understands his responsibility to declare all convictions to the Registrar.

THE HONOURABLE MR JUSTICE SWEETING :
Introduction
This is an appeal by Kanchana Vanhove (“the appellant”) against a prohibition order imposed on her by the Secretary of State for Education (SSE) in April 2024, following a recommendation by a Professional Conduct Panel (“the Panel”) of the Teaching Regulation Agency (TRA). The prohibition order prevents the appellant from teaching in England indefinitely, with a provision for a review after two years.
The TRA’s allegations before the Panel concerned the appellant’s conduct while she was employed as the headteacher at Wareside Church of England Primary School (“the school”). The TRA alleged that the appellant made unauthorised purchases and submitted inappropriate or unauthorised expense claims using school funds. This included purchases made through the school’s Amazon account and directly from the school's bank account. The Appellant maintained that these purchases were for the benefit of the school and were authorised. The TRA’s case was that many of the items were for the appellant's personal use.
The appellant argues that in finding that a number of the allegations against her were proved the Panel's approach was fundamentally flawed, resulting in a serious miscarriage of justice. She contends that the Panel’s findings of fact were inconsistent with the evidence presented and based on speculation rather than proof to the required standard. She further argues that the Panel's reasoning was unclear, lacked detail, and failed to properly address key evidence and arguments.
The SSE maintains that the Panel’s decision was properly arrived at on the evidence and that the appeal amounts to simple disagreement with the Panel’s assessment of the evidence and a rehearsal of arguments advanced at the hearing; arguments that the Panel rejected for reasons which were clearly set out and not capable of challenge on appeal.
Legal Framework of the Appeal
The appellant's appeal is brought under Regulation 17 of the Teachers’ Disciplinary (England) Regulations 2012, which grants a right of appeal to the King’s Bench Division of the High Court against a prohibition order. The appeal is governed by Part 52 of the Civil Procedure Rules (CPR). The parties disagreed as to whether the appeal should be conducted by way of review or a full rehearing.
The appellant argued, relying on O v Secretary of State for Education [2014] EWHC 22 (Admin) and Ullmer v SSE [2021] EWHC 1366 (Admin), that the appeal should be a rehearing. I was invited, in effect, to conduct a full re-examination of the first instance decision, including a rehearing on the merits and facts, substituting my own opinion for that of the original decision-maker. There were three bundles before the court running to just short of 1,500 pages together with an authorities bundle of some 480 pages. No suggested reading time was given in the appellant’s skeleton. The respondent suggested 2 hours, albeit in relation to a much smaller body of material. The Panel hearing had taken a total of 12 days spread across many months.
The SSE contends, citing Sutcliffe v Secretary of State for Education [2024] EWHC 1878 (Admin) that the appeal should proceed by way of review, not a “rehearing”. The consequence of an appeal by way of review is that the court will not generally rehear the evidence or make its own findings of fact. Instead, the court will review the decision of the Panel to ensure that it was lawful and procedurally fair, and that the findings of fact were supported by the evidence.
The SSE further argues that the appellant does not identify any particular circumstances which require the Court to adopt a different approach and conduct a ‘rehearing'. The SSE submits that all TRA appeals are generally by way of review and distinguishes Ullmer, where the interests of justice were held to require a rehearing. In that case a teacher was accused of engaging in sexual activity with a pupil, including playing ‘sexual’ games. The judge who heard the appeal, Steyn J, determined that the interests of justice required a ‘rehearing’ due to the gravity of the accusations and the impact they had on the appellant’s reputation and ability to work; in effect that he would never be able to work again as a teacher.
I am satisfied that the correct approach is to review the decision of the Panel. This is because, as Pepperall J explained in Sutcliffe, Panels have the advantage of hearing the witnesses and are best placed to decide matters of disputed fact. The court must give weight to the Panel’s assessment of the credibility of witnesses and the expertise of the Panel and the SSE as decision-makers. It should not lightly interfere with their findings and decisions and, in the absence of hearing from the witnesses in person, is generally ill-equipped to do so. In GMC v Jagjivan [2017] 1 WLR 4438: The Divisional Court emphasised the high degree of deference appellate courts must accord to the factual findings of the tribunal of fact, particularly those based on witness credibility. The Supreme Court's judgement in Henderson v Foxworth [2014] UKSC 41 illustrates the width of the principle that an appellate court should not overturn a decision simply because it would have reached a different conclusion. What matters is ""whether the decision under appeal is one that no reasonable judge could have reached""
It follows that it is not for this court to retry the case. Instead, the court’s task is to review the decision of the Panel and to interfere only if it is persuaded that the decision was “wrong” or “unjust because of a serious procedural or other irregularity” (CPR r. 52.21(3)). The court will only overturn a finding of fact made by the Panel if it is satisfied that the finding was perverse; in other words, if it was a finding that no reasonable Panel could have reached on the evidence.
I am also satisfied that the allegations against the appellant, while serious, do not meet the threshold for exceptional circumstances that require a full “rehearing” as was the case in Ullmer. The requirements for a “rehearing” were further clarified in Hart v SSE [2024] EWHC 44 (KB) where Eyre J held that the consequences of a prohibition order and the resulting reputational harm do not necessarily justify an appeal by way of rehearing. The present case is more analogous to Sutcliffe as the Panel found misconduct but, considering the mitigation available to the appellant, recommended the earliest possible date for review of the prohibition order. In that respect the appellant's case differs from cases where there is no right to apply for such a review.
Grounds of Appeal
The appellant denied making unauthorised purchases for personal benefit using the school’s Amazon account and bank funds. She claimed that all purchases (to the extent accepted as having been made by her) were for school purposes or duly authorised by the Assistant Head Teacher (AHT). The appellant’s Notice of Appeal, dated 2 May 2024, set out five grounds:
The Panel was wrong to refuse to dismiss the allegations at the close of the TRA’s case. At the conclusion of the TRA's evidence, the appellant's counsel submitted that there was no case to answer and asked the Panel to discontinue the proceedings. The Panel, however, determined that there was sufficient evidence to proceed with most of the allegations, whilst dismissing others.
The Panel’s decision was based on inconsistent findings of fact and or facts which are not probative of the allegations. The appellant argued that the Panel's findings were not consistent with the evidence presented and that some findings were not relevant to the allegations. She specifically contested the Panel's conclusion regarding the processes followed for Amazon purchases.
The Panel’s reasons were inadequate. The appellant argued that the Panel's reasoning for their decision was not sufficient. She claimed that the Panel did not adequately engage with her submissions, particularly those highlighting flaws in the TRA's case. She also argued that the Panel did not provide sufficient reasons for rejecting her explanations regarding certain purchases.
The Panel reversed the burden of proof. The appellant argued that the Panel improperly shifted the burden of proof onto her, requiring her to prove her innocence rather than the TRA proving her guilt.
The Panel placed undue reliance on hearsay evidence. The appellant argued that the Panel overly relied on hearsay evidence, particularly statements from witnesses who did not have direct knowledge of the events.
Thus, the appellant’s arguments to a large extent focus on challenging the Panel's factual findings. The skeleton filed on her behalf encapsulated the appeal as follows: “This appeal is essentially based on arguments that the tribunal's findings and conclusions were against the evidence, or against the weight of the evidence.”
Factual Background
The appellant has been a teacher since 2002. She worked as a supply teacher at the school in the Autumn term of 2016. Between Easter 2017 and Autumn 2017, the school had a Headteacher from another school for two days a week, and the appellant was Acting Headteacher for the remaining three days a week. In Autumn 2017, the appellant accepted the role of Interim Part-time Headteacher on a temporary basis until Christmas 2017. The appellant left the school in November 2017, as she was pregnant. She was not formally employed by the school between November 2017 and September 2018. She returned to the school in September 2018, as permanent part-time Headteacher, working Mondays, Tuesdays and Wednesdays with some flexibility to attend meetings on other days.
In May 2019, Individual F, the Deputy Headteacher, approached Witness A, the Chair of Governors, to make a whistleblowing disclosure concerning the appellant’s potential misappropriation of school funds. As a result of this disclosure, the school’s internal auditor, the Shared Internal Audit Service (“SIAS”) commenced an audit in June 2019. The SIAS investigation  uncovered sufficient concerns to recommend a ""deeper investigation"" by the Local Authority's Shared Anti-Fraud Service “SAFS”. The appellant was suspended from her role on 28 June 2019.
Ms. Nelson (Witness C) from SAFS was appointed to conduct a disciplinary investigation on behalf of the school governors.
The investigation focused on the allegations made by Ms. Duffy (Witness B) and Ms. Aubrey (Witness D) against the appellant regarding purchases using the school's Amazon account and other purchases.
The scope of the investigation was limited to interviewing the appellant, the Assistant Headteacher, and two witnesses. Notably, other staff members who the appellant suggested could provide relevant information were not interviewed. Ms Nelson interviewed Individual, and other staff members. The appellant was also interviewed under caution. Witness C produced a report of her investigation on 23 September 2019.
The appellant resigned on 9 December 2019. A disciplinary hearing was held in her absence on 15 January 2020, at which she was dismissed.
Allegations
The allegations against the appellant were set out in a Notice of Hearing dated 27 April 2023 as follows:
Allegation 1
Between November 2018 and May 2019 you made unauthorised purchases and/or claims:
Using the school’s Amazon account and/or
From the school’s bank account/School monies.
Particulars of Allegation 1
(i) You made unauthorised purchases using the school’s Amazon account, in that you purchased the items as detailed in Schedule 1 for your own benefit and not for the benefit of the school.
You made unauthorised claims from the school’s bank account/school monies, in that you claimed for the items as detailed in Schedule 2 for your own benefit and not for the benefit of the school.
You submitted inappropriate and/or unauthorised expenses claims, as detailed at Schedule 3.
Allegation 2
Your conduct in making the purchases and/or claims as set out at Allegation 1 lacked integrity and was dishonest in that you knew that they were not for the benefit of the school.
Allegation 3
On or around 7 June 2019, you did not provide one or more invoices, namely those detailed at Schedules 1-3, to the external auditors.
Allegation 4
Your conduct in withholding invoices as set out at Allegation 3 lacked integrity and was dishonest in that you were seeking to conceal your conduct described at Allegation 1.
The Panel Hearing
The Panel hearing took place on 12, 13, 14, 17, 18 and 19 July 2023 and on 19, 20, 25, 26 and 27 March 2024 and 5 April 2024 as a remote hearing conducted using Microsoft Teams.
The TRA called witnesses A, B and D to give evidence. The appellant gave evidence in her own defence and also called Witness E (the Interim Deputy Head Teacher) to give evidence on her behalf.
The TRA did not call Individual F to give evidence. The Panel was provided with a copy of the record of Individual F’s interview with Witness C, and was told that Individual F would not be attending to give evidence due to stress related to the previous internal proceedings.
Financial Controls
As the Panel found, the School was required to adhere to the financial regulations outlined in the Hertfordshire County Council Financial Handbook for Schools (“the Handbook”). The relevant provisions of the Handbook as referred to by the panel were:
Paragraph 10.1.2: “The officer authorising an order must be satisfied that the intended goods or services are appropriate and needed (e.g. are they for a curriculum area, or a school trip), are available within the approved budget… that the goods or services have been subject to any tendering requirements.”
Paragraph 10.1.6: “Orders must be used only for goods and services provided to the School. Neither employees nor any other organisations connected to the School may use official orders for personal gain.”
Paragraph 10.2.6: “Reimbursement for travel and other expenses incurred by the Headteacher… shall be made on the production of appropriate receipts, subject to approval by the governing body… The governing body can set a financial limit below which specific approval will not be required”. In this instance, the limit for the Headteacher has been set at £2,000.
Thus, the Handbook stipulated that purchase orders were to be made using a prescribed system, with a limit on the Headteacher's spending authority. The school had a system where purchases and expense reimbursements required authorisation by two designated signatories: the Headteacher (the appellant) and the Assistant Headteacher (AHT - Individual F).
For expenses or transactions exceeding £2,000, both the appellant and Individual F needed to sign. For the appellant's personal expense claims, Individual F's counter-signature was mandatory, regardless of the amount. Purchases made by staff with personal funds were to be submitted for reimbursement with receipts, and subject to the same two-signature authorisation process. However, the evidence before the Panel suggested that these procedures were not always followed consistently. Specifically, there were instances where payments had been made without supporting invoices. In reaching its findings of fact, the Panel made a specific finding that the ""financial and administrative processes within the School were in a state of some disarray"".
The typical ordering process at the school involved an initial request being recorded in a ""Pink Book”, followed by the placement of an order and the receipt of an invoice. The invoice would then be checked against the order and the delivered goods before being paid. However, the ""Pink Book"" went missing during the course of the investigations and was not before the Panel.
The intended process was that all purchases using school funds were to be recorded in the “Pink Book”. Staff members, usually Witness B or Witness D, would check orders written in the book and obtain the necessary authorisation. Orders were primarily placed with Hertfordshire County Council's supplier, “FullStop”, for common supplies like stationery. For items not available through FullStop or which were cheaper on Amazon, the school's Amazon account could be used. Upon delivery, Witness B would check the goods and invoice against the order in the “Pink Book”. Witness D would then raise a cheque for payment. The amount dictated whether authorisation from the appellant, Individual F, or both, was required. Witness D would record the cheque number and payment date in the “Pink Book”, file the invoice, and input the information into the computer system. This would be reviewed by Hertfordshire County Council's external accountant. The Amazon account was set up by Witness B in August 2018, initially using her personal bank card and name. In September 2018, Ms. Vanhove instructed Witness B to change the account to use a school bank card. Witness B maintained that the process for Amazon orders mirrored that of FullStop orders, with entries in the “Pink Book” and subsequent printing and stapling of the order confirmation to the corresponding book page.
The Panel determined that for a payment or claim to be authorised, it had to be for the benefit of the school. The Panel considered that accepting the argument that purchases were authorised simply because they were within the appellant’s financial limit would lead to a perverse outcome. Such an interpretation would suggest that the purchase of an item for personal use could be categorised as properly authorised as long as it was within the financial limit of authority. The Panel did not agree that a purchase of an item for personal use could be defined as properly authorised in these circumstances.
The Panel concluded that authorisation must fall within the terms of paragraph 10.1.6 of the Handbook, and must relate to goods and services provided to the school for its benefit. Individuals associated with the school were not entitled to use the school’s accounts to obtain goods and services for their private use. These conclusions as to what could properly be authorised appear to me to be both a logical and common sense application of the rules and certainly not wrong as a matter of law or construction. They were also supported by the witness evidence.
The Panel’s Approach to the Evidence
The appellant submits that the Panel put undue weight on the hearsay evidence from Individual F, given that she was not called to give evidence, and her evidence could not therefore be challenged in cross-examination.
The Panel acknowledged that hearsay evidence played a role in the case against the appellant, particularly due to the absence of the Deputy Headteacher, Individual F, as a witness. The Panel emphasised that it had treated hearsay evidence with caution. It recognised the inherent limitations of such evidence, given that it was not directly tested under oath. Consequently, it assessed the weight that could be attributed to each piece of hearsay evidence. The Panel sought to determine whether the hearsay evidence was corroborated by other evidence in the case and looked for supporting evidence in three areas:
Oral Testimony from Witnesses: Did any of the witnesses who testified in person provide information that supported the hearsay statements?
Hearsay from Other Individuals: Were there statements from other individuals, even if not directly involved in the case, that aligned with the existing hearsay?
Contemporaneous Documentary Evidence: Did documents created at the time of the alleged events, such as emails, invoices, or meeting minutes, provide consistency with the hearsay claims?
It is clear that the Panel applied a cautious and corroborative approach when considering hearsay evidence in relation to Individual F and examined whether any other evidence could substantiate hearsay statements concerning her actions or knowledge. The approach taken by the Panel to the hearsay evidence was a conventional one. The Panel was entitled to take hearsay evidence into account and did not, in my view, give undue weight to it.
The appellant also argued that the TRA had failed to call other witnesses, who could have given relevant evidence. However, the TRA is not obliged to call every witness who might have something to say about the matters in issue. It is for the TRA to decide which witnesses to call. The Panel was entitled and bound to reach its decision on the evidence before it.
Dismissal of Some Allegations at the Close of the TRA’s Case
At the conclusion of the TRA’s case, the appellant’s counsel applied for the allegations to be dismissed on the basis that the TRA had failed to establish a prima facie case.
The Panel considered this application carefully. The Panel took legal advice and reminded itself of the test to be applied as set out in paragraph 5.82(ii) of the Disciplinary procedures for the teaching profession:
“The Panel may discontinue the proceedings at any stage if it considers that in the particular circumstances it would be fair and appropriate to do so, either because: (i) a fair hearing is no longer possible; or (ii) it would offend the Panel’s sense of justice and propriety to continue the proceedings.”
The Panel concluded that the TRA had established a prima facie case in relation to most of the allegations. However, it decided to dismiss the following allegations:
Schedule 1, Item 12: Amazon invoice for “D'addario PW- CT-17BK Eclipse Tuner (Black)” £9.99 - The Panel determined that there was no evidence upon which it could find that the appellant made unauthorised purchases using the Amazon account in respect of this item or that the evidence was so unsatisfactory that it could not find the allegation proved.
Schedule 3 Item 4 Cheque requisition and receipt for digital printing at Snappy Snaps £26.94. Schedule 3, Item 5: Cheque requisition and receipt for: 2x Astronauts handbook, 2x Minecraft books £21.98 - The Panel concluded that the absence of any cogent evidence meant that there was no realistic prospect of the allegation being proved, and for similar reasons the following;
Schedule 3, Item 8: Cheque requisition and receipt for 26x Shuttleworth Kids Gift Bags, postcards and sweet bags £119.11.
Schedule 3 Item 9 Cheque requisition and receipt £50.74.
Schedule 3 Item 10 Cheque requisition and receipt payment to Dynamic Earth Enterprises £40.25
Schedule 3 Item 12: Cheque requisition and invoice for Next: Memo Board £26.00 - The Panel noted that the item was delivered to the appellant's home address but decided this was not significant as it was purchased using the appellant's own account, hence the request for reimbursement. Additionally, the witnesses did not know about the item and it could not be located.
In addition to these specific items, the Panel also found that there was no case to answer in relation to allegation 2 (lack of integrity and dishonesty) relating to these specific items. The Panel made clear that it did not adopt a generalised approach to allegation 1, but had considered each item separately. The remainder of the allegations were allowed to proceed. The Panel's approach demonstrates in my view that it carried out a careful analysis in relation to the sufficiency and quality of the evidence. It gave a reasoned decision in relation to those items in respect of which the evidential threshold had not been cleared but declined to express any views in relation to those matters which it allowed to proceed. This was the proper approach since once the Panel had concluded that there was a case to answer it would have been inappropriate for it to make any assessment of witnesses which might change in the light of subsequent defence evidence. The Panel’s decision not to accede to the compendious submission that the proceedings should be dismissed in their entirety was well within the ambit of a rational application of the relevant test.
The Panel’s Findings in Relation to the Remaining Allegations
At the end of the hearing and after considering all of the evidence, the Panel concluded that the TRA had proved a number of the remaining allegations although not all of them. The Panel’s findings in relation to each allegation which was found to have been proved are as follows:
Allegation 1(a)(i): Unauthorised Purchases on the School’s Amazon Account
The Panel found that the appellant had made the following unauthorised purchases using the school’s Amazon account between November 2018 and May 2019:
Four sets of 16 large clear plastic Martini cocktail glasses (ordered on 7 November 2018).
Two Traditional Garden Croquet Sets (ordered on 7 November 2018).
Thirty Champagne flutes (ordered on 7 November 2018).
Outdoor string lights described as “For indoor & outdoor décor, wedding light, backyard lig…” (ordered on 7 November 2018).
Giant ‘Jenga’ set (ordered on 8 November 2018).
A bike computer (ordered on 10 May 2019).
A Hornby locomotive and level crossing (ordered on 16 May 2019).
The Panel found that the appellant had purchased these items for her own benefit, and not for the benefit of the school. The appellant admitted that she had made orders using the school’s Amazon account, but she denied ordering these items. Witness B gave evidence that the appellant had told her that she was buying the martini cocktail glasses for an event for headteachers at the school, but the Panel found that this was implausible, given the quantity of glasses purchased. An email exchange between the appellant and Witness B on 2 November 2018, a few days before the martini glasses and champagne flutes were ordered, showed the appellant stating that she intended to make an order on Amazon. In cross-examination the appellant accepted that there was no school use for martini glasses stating: ""There was no need for, obviously martini glasses at the school"".
In the email exchange on 2 November the appellant stated she wished to ""order a few things for Remembrance service etc from Amazon"" and mentioned using the ""admin email and Autumn2018"" as the password. Although she was not sure if she had the correct password, this demonstrated her awareness of the existence of the school's Amazon account and that she had used it before. Witness B responded giving the correct email address for the Amazon account, stating, ""we have a business account but it still defaults to my Visa card, have a go!"". The timing of the email exchange is crucial because it directly precedes the ordering of items that the appellant later denied purchasing. The Panel used this to support their conclusion that the appellant did in fact place those orders. Later in the email exchange, on 5 November, the appellant wrote to Witness B stating, ""I am also just finalising the final Amazon order with everyone"". Witness B confirmed that she could attach emails relating to orders to the pages in the “pink book” so that school orders could have been recorded within the ordering and approval system.
The appellant claimed that she and Witness E, the Assistant Headteacher, had observed the Amazon account being left open on the school computer, implying that others could have used the account to make purchases. However Witness E's evidence directly contradicted the appellant’s case in this respect and Witness E’s, unequivocal, evidence was preferred by the Panel.
The appellant contended that the Panel was incorrect to find that the croquet sets were only suitable for persons aged 14 and over. However, the Panel had a report from Witness C, who gave oral evidence, which stated that the sets were described as ""for age '14 years and up' on Amazon"". The Panel also had a picture of the croquet set. Given the fact that the school was a primary school, the Panel could and did reasonably conclude that the croquet sets were not age appropriate.
The hearing bundle contained an expenses form relating to the courtyard, which recorded that £600 had been donated for spending on the Courtyard and identified cheques paid in that sum. The Panel concluded that there was no link between the donation for the courtyard and the purchase of the croquet sets.  The Panel rejected the appellant’s argument that the croquet sets might have been bought by a teaching assistant (Individual G) and were said to be intended for use by the Friends (or PTA), citing the Handbook, which provided that ""individuals or other organisations associated with the school (e.g., PTAs) must not use official orders to obtain goods and services for their private use"". It was open to the Panel to conclude that even if the sets had been purchased for the PTA, this would not have been a legitimate use of school funds or the school's official order system.
As far as the Giant Jenga set was concerned the Panel again rejected the appellant’s suggestion that Individual G may have ordered the Jenga set. The Panel had already found that only the appellant and Witness B had access to the Amazon account. The Panel was plainly not reversing the burden of proof but merely observed that there was no evidence to support, what was essentially, speculation on the appellant’s part. The conclusion that the purchase of the Giant ‘Jenga’ set was unauthorised and not for the benefit of the school was rooted in the evidence.
The bike computer was ordered on the same order number as a guitar tuner that the appellant admitted to ordering. The Panel could properly conclude that the shared order number was evidence that the two items were purchased by the same person. The Panel accepted Witness B’s evidence that her name appeared on the Amazon orders by default because she had set up the account and that it did not necessarily mean she had placed the orders.
The Panel accepted the evidence of Witness B and Witness D that certain items, such as the Jenga set, the Hornby train and plastic glasses, appeared at the school after the audit had commenced. That was significant because it suggested that these items had not been at the school when they were purchased and were therefore unlikely to have been bought for the benefit of the school. Witness B stated that, during the week commencing Monday 10 June 2019, after the auditors had visited, items started appearing in the school that had not been there before. Individual F's evidence, in interview, was to similar effect.
The Panel concluded that Witness B had no reason to provide anything other than a truthful account both during the investigation and in her oral testimony. This was clearly a significant factor in their assessment of her credibility. She remained firm in her evidence when questioned, whereas the Panel noted that the appellant changed her account on various issues. The Panel noted that there was a positive and constructive relationship between Witness B and the appellant, including the appellant supporting Witness B in her career progression. This made it less likely, in the Panel’s view, that Witness B would misrepresent events. The Panel noted that for the appellant's version of events to be true, it would require Witness B, Witness D, and Individual F to all be misrepresenting the situation. The Panel were unwilling to accept that Witness B was not providing an accurate account of events and preferred her evidence.
The Panel’s conclusions in relation to these items therefore turn on its assessment of the evidence of witnesses speaking to the primary facts in dispute. Its findings that the appellant had made unauthorised purchases for her own benefit was the inevitable consequence of the Panel disbelieving her evidence and preferring the evidence of other witnesses. There can be no suggestion that having performed its fact-finding role the conclusions to which it then came were perverse. Further it is clear from the transcripts that the appellant's case as to why her evidence should have been accepted was fully argued in front of the Panel.
Allegation 1(a)(ii): Unauthorised Claim from the School’s Bank Account
The Panel found that the appellant had made an unauthorised claim from the school’s bank account for 120 paper airplane place cards in brown kraft paper (claimed on 28 November 2018).
The appellant stated that the paper airplanes were for a school science event. However, a text message from the appellant to a sign-maker called Individual H some months previously showed the appellant asking for “place cards (names on paper planes)” for her wedding. The order itself also described the items as “place cards”. The Panel found that the appellant had claimed for these items for her own benefit, and not for the benefit of the school. The Panel considered but did not accept the appellant’s claim that the paper airplanes were for science events, in the face of compelling evidence that they were for her wedding.
Allegation 1(b): Inappropriate and Unauthorised Expense Claims
The Panel found that the appellant had submitted inappropriate and unauthorised expense claims for the following:
An invoice from Squarespace for a website (claimed on 19 December 2019).
Signage for an EYFS/Nursery Promotion, and invoice for “Mother Wild:- A2 Signage and Easel Hire” (claimed on 1 February 2019).
A receipt from the Royal Airforce Museum’s caterers (claimed on 3 April 2019).
Food ordered from M&S (claimed on 3 April 2019).
Books including “Midnight Gang, Sticker Shoot Activity, Storm Keepers Island, Slime book the outdoor making lab, Bday JJ, Take a View, Congratulations, Incredible 2 official guide”.
The invoice from Squarespace was issued in July 2018, when the appellant was not employed by the school. The website content contained the wording “nothingfancyjustlove.wedding”. The Panel concluded that this website was consistent with use as the appellant’s wedding website. The evidence showed that the appellant had contacted Mother Wild for a sign for the launch of “The Aviatrix Project”, which was an initiative that the appellant had set up to raise the profile of women in aviation. The invoice from Mother Wild was for the correct amount for this sign. A photograph of the sign was posted on Mother Wild’s social media pages. The receipt from the Royal Airforce Museum’s caterers was dated on a Sunday, when there would have been no school event at the museum. The catering company in question operated the museum’s restaurant.
The food order from M&S contained high cost items, including ""Tiger Prawns, Salmon, Luxury Canape Selection etc"" that were not appropriate for school use. There was an excessive amount of food for a school event, with 22 multi-packs of food purchased. The collection date of the M&S food order was on Good Friday, when schools were closed for the Easter weekend, and no school events were scheduled. The appellant suggested that the invoice had been tampered with and that the food was not a single large order of luxury items, but a collection of items purchased at various stores. She suggested that the invoice had been copy pasted onto a Word document and the date changed. The Panel was entitled to observe, as it did, that this was a serious allegation and that the appellant had taken no steps to produce evidence to substantiate it.
The books were purchased in July 2018, when the appellant was on maternity leave. The appellant argued that the Panel had reversed the burden of proof in relation to the purchase because the Panel noted she had not called evidence from the Assistant Headteacher and English lead (Witness E) to support her claim that she had discussed the books with her. In my view this mischaracterises the Panel's approach and findings. The Panel did not require the appellant to prove that she had discussed the book purchase with Witness E. Rather, it considered all of the evidence presented, including the lack of evidence supporting her version of events. The Panel was entitled to note the absence of supporting evidence when weighing the facts. The burden of proof remained on the TRA throughout. The Panel’s conclusion was based on a consideration of all the evidence, and not on any inappropriate reversal of the burden of proof
The Panel concluded that the appellant had submitted these expense claims knowing that she was not entitled to do so. These were all reasoned findings that the Panel came to on the evidence before it; there is nothing to suggest that a reasonable Panel could not have reached such conclusions or that they were in any way perverse.
Allegation 2: Lack of Integrity and Dishonesty
In light of its findings in relation to Allegations 1(a) and 1(b), the Panel concluded that the appellant’s conduct in making the purchases and expense claims lacked integrity and was dishonest. The Panel found that the appellant knew that the purchases and expenses were not for the benefit of the school. This conclusion was one that the Panel were bound to come to following its factual findings in relation to Allegation 1.
Allegation 3: Withholding Invoices from the Auditors
The Panel did not uphold Allegation 3. Allegation 3 was that the appellant did not provide one or more invoices to external auditors. The Panel noted that while it appeared to Witness B that the appellant had removed some invoices, this was not sufficient to prove that she had deliberately withheld documents. Additionally, the Panel noted that only 6 out of 30 invoices were alleged to have been removed. The Panel concluded that if the appellant had been attempting to mislead the auditors, it was more likely she would have removed many more. The appellant argued that Witness B had retained a folder of invoices that were not provided to SIAS and supplied these to Witness C as part of her disciplinary investigation. Witness C stated that she could not recall where the invoices she received had come from. She did not confirm that they came from a separate folder or that they were different from the ones provided to SIAS. In any event the TRA confirmed that it did not rely upon Witness C's evidence about invoices in relation to Allegation 3. Ultimately the Panel was not satisfied that the TRA had proven, on the balance of probabilities, that the appellant had failed to provide invoices to the auditors.
Allegation 4: Dishonesty in Withholding Invoices
As the Panel did not find Allegation 3 proved, it followed that Allegation 4 could also not be proved.
Analysis
The appellant’s appeal is essentially an attack on the Panel’s findings of fact. As summarised above the appellant argues that the Panel misinterpreted the evidence, or that the evidence was insufficient to support the Panel’s findings. However, she does not identify any legal errors made by the Panel, nor any serious procedural irregularity in the conduct of the hearing.
In Southall v General Medical Council [2010] EWCA Civ 407 at [55], Leveson LJ said that he had no difficulty “in concluding that, in straightforward cases, setting out the facts to be proved … and finding them proved or not proved will generally be sufficient both to demonstrate to the parties why they won or lost and to explain to any appellate Tribunal the facts found. In most cases, particularly those concerned with comparatively simple conflicts of factual evidence, it will be obvious whose evidence has been rejected and why”. He added that even where a case could be described as exceptional a few sentences dealing with the salient issue was the essential requirement [56]. The panel more than met these requirements in this case.
I have carefully considered the evidence and the submissions made by both parties. I have reached the following conclusions:
The Panel had sufficient evidence before it to reach the conclusions that it did.
The Panel took a careful and item by item approach to the allegations which the TRA was required to prove to the applicable standard.
The Panel was entitled to make the findings of fact which it did about the appellant’s credibility and to prefer the evidence of other witnesses.
The Panel was entitled to draw inferences from the evidence, and the inferences that it drew were reasonable in all the circumstances.
The Panel did not reverse the burden of proof. The Panel was correct to find that the appellant had a duty to act honestly and with integrity, and that this duty included ensuring that all purchases made on behalf of the school were for the benefit of the school.
The Panel’s approach to the hearsay evidence was appropriate.
The Panel gave adequate reasons for its decision.
In short, the appellant has not persuaded me that the Panel’s decision was “wrong”.
Conclusion
For the reasons set out above, the appellant’s appeal is dismissed. The prohibition order imposed by the SSE remains in force subject to the appellant’s entitlement in due course to seek a review.

Introduction
Mr Van Buuren (“the Claimant”) was seriously injured in a road traffic accident and brings a claim against a number of defendants.
The first defendant (“D1”) is the Chief Constable of Cambridgeshire Constabulary. The second defendant (“D2”) is the Chief Constable of Hertfordshire Police. The third defendant (“D3”) is the Chief Constable of Bedfordshire Police. The fourth defendant (“D4”) is the Independent Office for Police Conduct (“IOPC” - previously the Independent Police Complaints Commission).
Applications
D1, D2, D3 have made application to strike out the claim because, they say, it is,
time barred;
discloses no reasonable grounds for bringing the claim (in that no complete cause of action is pleaded);
an abuse of process or otherwise likely to obstruct the just disposal of the proceedings and;
the Claimant has failed to comply with court orders.
D4 also seeks an order striking out the Claimant’s case pursuant to CPR 3.4, and in the alternative an order for Summary Judgment pursuant to CPR 24.2 because:
the Particulars of Claim do not set out reasonable grounds for bringing a claim against D4; and/or
the statement of case is an abuse of the court’s process or is otherwise likely to obstruct the just disposal of the proceedings; and/or
there has been a failure to comply with a rule, practice direction or court order.
Alternatively, the Claimant has no real prospect of succeeding in his claim against D4, and there is no other compelling reason why the case should be disposed of at trial.
In the alternative Summary judgment should be entered against the Claimant on the whole or part of his claims against D4 pursuant to CPR 24.2.
The Claimant in turn seeks to strike out the defences of D1-3 and seeks summary judgment against all Defendants on the basis that they have no prospect of defending the claims.
The Hearing
The Claimant is a litigant in person. Prior to the hearing he was asked whether he had any particular vulnerabilities which the court needed to consider. He answered in the affirmative, identifying psychiatric illness and other consequential conditions which he indicated would impair his ability to attend at court and might prejudice his participation in the hearing. To minimise these adverse effects, he proposed that he attend the hearing remotely. I acceded to that request but, on the day of the hearing, the Claimant appeared in person.
Although the Claimant indicated that in recollecting the factual events which form the background to his injuries and their aftermath, he was he likely to become emotional or angry he was in fact able to present his case cogently and without the interruptions which he had anticipated might occur. He had also prepared a well thought out and complete bundle of documents. Although I gained the impression that he was at times emotionally labile I was satisfied at the outset of the hearing (from discussion with the Claimant) and throughout that he had capacity and was able to represent himself. He was offered breaks whenever he felt that he required them. I should also record that Defence counsel presented their applications in a sensitive manner.
Summary of the Claim
On 2013-August-28, while cycling on Glebe Way in Histon, Cambridge, the Claimant came off his bike. Although he was not aware of how the accident had occurred at the time, he now alleges that the accident was caused by a motorist referred to as “DG” who struck his bicycle. An independent witness named Lynn Coleman (“LC”) was present at the scene. The Claimant suffered a head injury that caused him to lose consciousness for 31 minutes and has no memory of the accident. Two police officers from D1’s force, namely Police Constable Kenneth Telfer Moffat (“KM”) and Police Constable Judith Reeves (“JR”) arrived at the scene. The Claimant asserts that, taking advantage of his unconscious state, D1's police officers ""eliminated"" LC as a witness, collaborated with and exonerated DG, and tampered with evidence.
The Claimant was taken to hospital in a police car, but it is alleged, due to the actions of the police, the severity of his injuries was not immediately recognised. The Claimant alleges that, although medical personnel noted no abnormalities after his arrival at the hospital, he later collapsed and was moved to the resuscitation unit. He argues that if the police officers had not interfered, medical personnel would have promptly diagnosed his ruptured spleen and treated him accordingly. He asserts that the attending police officers and their control room senior officer had formed the intention to kill him and sought to do so because of a shared hatred of cyclists.
In October 2013, the Claimant was informed by D1/D2's Collision Investigation Unit that no further action would be taken regarding the accident. The Claimant alleges that D1’s and D2’s employees had conspired to falsify the investigation into the collision. He claims that D1 created a false report concluding that his injuries resulted from a self-induced fall from his bicycle. Furthermore, he claims that D2 falsified investigation reports to support D1's dishonest account of events.
Upon discovering what he believed to be dishonesty in the police reports, the Claimant initiated his own investigation, including submitting multiple requests under the Data Protection Act. He developed PTSD and experienced income loss. In August 2014, the Claimant filed a complaint against D1 pursuant to the Police Reform Act 2002. He claims that, in 2015, officers from D1, D3, and D4 conspired to falsify the investigation of his complaint to cover up the false version of events presented by D1.
Through Data Protection Act requests, the Claimant obtained over 300 documents, including, in 2017 (over three years after the collision), contact information for LC. As a result of obtaining documents in this way the Claimant asserts that he uncovered conspiracies between the various defendants and his rights of action against each of them. He also claims to have discovered that he had sustained undiagnosed and untreated psychiatric injuries. He contends that PTSD disturbances including suicidal thoughts led to the collapse of his professional and personal relationships. He claims to have developed, amongst other conditions, sleep-wake disorders, panic disorder, and parasomnias. He believes that the stress of these events was also a factor in his father's suicide in 2019. He claims that his career came to an end and that he became unemployable due to his injuries and illnesses. His relationships with his friends and family have also been seriously affected by his fragile mental health.
The Claimant filed his Claim Form on 2022-March-29. The sole cause of action now pursued is misfeasance in public office against all four defendants. He is seeking £4.8 million in damages, including special damages for personal injury, aggravated and exemplary damages, and an account of the defendants' allegedly unlawful gains.
The Claimant was anxious, at the hearing, that the basis of his claim should not be mischaracterised.  Although I have summarised it (above) for the purposes of this judgment, I note that the Claimant himself provided a summary of the background, as he alleged it to be, in a letter dated 2022-February-8 to a Dr Robinson whom he was seeking to persuade to act as witness. The letter is a more succinct and narrative account than that set out in his witness statements and makes reference to further alleged conspiracies between the Defendants.  The Claimant’s account in the letter was:
“While riding my bicycle on a public road on 28 August 2013, I was intentionally struck from behind by the motorist DG. I was thrown over my bike and landed on the road surface with my helmeted head and the left side of my body. The impact rendered me unconscious for a period of 31 minutes. To this day, I have no recollection of any events during this time. The impact also caused rupturing of my spleen and various other injuries. Police officers of Cambridgeshire Constabulary (""Dl"") chanced on the scene 7 minutes after the collision. An independent witness LC immediately briefed them. In their assured belief that I was too severely injured to witness events or intervene, the officers eliminated LC,  collaborated with the offender BS to falsely brief the East of England Ambulance Service (""EA""), summarily exonerated DG and BS and destroyed collision evidence. Having unlawfully seized control of the scene and case, the officers entered into an agreement with the most senior serving employee in Dl's communications control room to attempt my death. To this end, police radios were switched off and private mobile phones were used for covert communication. The above malicious acts were motivated by shared hatred of cyclists as a group to which the antagonists believed I belonged...
D1 subsequently falsified its report into the collision. It claimed that I had inflicted injury on myself by falling off my bike and that DG had witnessed this. To this end, D1 fabricated DG's witness statement. The report eliminated the independent witness LC and all offenders. D1 exploited my unconsciousness and the destruction of evidence to make elaborate false statements. D1 subsequently entered into an agreement with Hertfordshire Constabulary (""D2"") to falsify a mandatory technical and criminal investigation into the collision. As part of this, D1 briefed D2 on their wrongdoing and fraud. D2 then summarily approved D1 's findings, barred criminal prosecutions of DG and BS, eliminated all liabilities for damage and buried the fabricated witness statement. Following a Subject Access Request to D1, D1 and D2 collaborated to provide a heavily redacted version of Dl's collision report. On detection of wrongdoing, I began a process of legal discovery that continues to date, including numerous further requests under the Data Protection Act. All Defendants identified in this letter used unlawful means to undermine these efforts. Two-and-a-half months after the collision, I developed the first diagnostic features of PTSD. With reference to DSM-5, these were avoidance conduct and, a month later, arousal and intrusion features. In January 2014, I first consulted the Practice with relevant symptoms. I had no contemporaneous knowledge or belief of PTSD...
In 2014, I made a complaint to D1 under the Police Reform Act 2002. In 2015, D1 entered into an agreement with Bedfordshire Police (""D3"") and the Independent Police Complaints Commission (""D4"", now IOPC) to falsify an investigation into this. In doing so, all criminal prosecutions were eliminated. Numerous offending employees of the Defendants were later forced to resign and remain free. The primary objective of the agreement between D1, D3 and D4 had been to minimise their greatest residual risk: my discovery of any civil liability and the bringing of a claim. To this end, D1, D3 and D4 entered into an agreement to cause psychiatric injury to me. They calculated to repeatedly exploit existing injuries, create false narratives, fabricate, destroy and conceal evidence and attack my credibility. By May 2014, I exhibited all the diagnostic features of PTSD. Of particular note were its progressive effects on relationships. I had developed intense feelings of anger, horror, distrust and human detachment. I routinely had angry outbursts at people I dealt with. This was exacerbated by the disbelief of my then unproven allegations expressed by family members and solicitors. By 2015, my injury-induced conduct had caused the collapse of my personal relationships with all friends, business associates and colleagues...
To date, 52 firms of solicitors and barristers chambers have been consulted. Even after sufficient legal discovery, all disbelieved my allegations and declined representation. This is not uncommon in cases involving outrageous conduct and high-handed defendants.”
The Claimant’s summary of his claim, at paragraph 2 of his skeleton argument for the hearing before me, under the heading “Synopsis of Case,” is as follows:
The essence of this claim is concerted and protracted abuse by 4 holders of public office.
D1 attempted C’s death following serious personal injuries sustained in a malicious road traffic collision. This attempt was motivated by hatred of cyclists as a group to which C was perceived to belong.
Following the failure of the murder attempt, D1 caused aggregated and further loss to C that is actionable in civil law.
D2, D3 and D4 variously conspired with D1 to enhance and aggravate C’s losses over a period of almost 9 years.
C’s losses include longstanding, ongoing and untreated psychiatric illness with high associated suicide risk.
Each Defendant is held liable in misfeasance in public office. D1, D3and D4 are jointly and severally liable in the same loss to C.
C seeks damages of £4.8m including exemplary and aggravated damages. C additionally seeks accounts of the Defendants’ unlawful gains and their disgorgement to charity.
4.1.8.2 The Defendants’ concerted and protracted abuses are so outrageous that they have been consistently disbelieved by all medical and legal professionals. The majority of personal injuries caused, including psychiatric illness, remain undiagnosed and untreated to date.”
Counsel for D1-3 helpfully, and in my view accurately, reduced the Claimant’s overall case to the following factual propositions:
On the day that he was injured, D1’s officers/staff attempted deliberately to delay his arrival at hospital in order to kill him (i.e. attempted murder);
D1’s officers deliberately falsified the record/ investigation of the incident to conceal the existence of a collision between a motor car and the Claimant’s bicycle which knocked him off his bicycle; and
Subsequent actions by D1-D4 have knowingly (and in bad faith) continued to conceal the truth of the initial collision and/or the falsified investigation.
The Claimant has filed two witness statements in response to the applications. In his first witness statement of the 18th of November 2022, under the heading “basis of action”, the Claimant says “Each defendant is liable in the tort of misfeasance in public office. The damage caused is personal injury.” His Particulars of Claim essentially plead the same cause of action, although at great length.
The Claimant’s second witness statement has three exhibits: GLvB1, GLvB2, and GLvB3, which are relied upon as evidence to support his claim of misfeasance in public office.
Exhibit GLvB1 includes a witness statement which the Claimant alleges was fabricated by one of the attending police officers, JM, and falsely attributed to DG, the individual the Claimant alleges collided with his bicycle. The statement was made using a standard police form, apparently sent to the witness, which poses a series of questions relevant to a road traffic accident that may have involved a collision. The first, and rather slim, reason for suggesting fabrication is that, at paragraph 9, the statement refers to the cyclist requiring hospitalisation, a feature of the incident which the Claimant suggests the witness could not have been aware of. Although the witness's personal details have been redacted, the date on which the statement was made appears to be the 1st of September 2013, a few days after,  rather than on, the day of the accident.
There is a further and more developed basis for suggesting that the statement is not authentic which arises by reason of the accident investigation report (“the collision report”) which is also within Exhibit GLvB1. The author of that report is KM, although it also includes a note from JR giving a short account of the Claimant’s condition after the accident which is silent as to the presence or involvement of any members of the public and other drivers. The report includes sections in relation to individual witnesses which have been redacted to remove their names and personal details. However, the first section must apply to DG and states “see pro forma statement” and “statement received”. The main body of the report appears to have been filled in by KM as the reporting officer. The Claimant produced a comparison document of handwriting samples from the witness statement attributed to DG and KM’s handwriting from the collision report. He copied 18 graphic selections of handwriting from each document and pasted the 36 selections side-by-side in two columns asserting that they were close to identical and arguing that the probability of two random individuals having such similar handwriting is “infinitesimal”. The Claimant’s analysis therefore suggests, if correct, that the witness statement attributed to DG was written by KM. For my part I would observe that KM has very distinctive capitalised handwriting and that a comparison between the two documents would indeed suggest to the reasonable reader, as the Claimant argues, that they may have been completed by the same individual.
As far as the remainder of the collision report is concerned it asserts that there were a further two potential witnesses, in addition to DG, neither of whom witnessed the accident. That is confirmed explicitly later in the report where it is stated that there were no independent witnesses to the incident. In context that must mean “other witnesses” since the statement from DG contains at Section 3 what reports to be an eyewitness account of how the accident occurred which is referred to and repeated in the collision report. The conclusion of the report is that the Claimant was going too fast on his bicycle for the conditions, lost control and was responsible for his own injuries so that no further police action was required. That can only have been based on the evidence attributed to DG. The final paragraph of the report says “extensive inquiries have been made regarding any witnesses to the incident, this is negative.”
D2 and D3 became involved in the case because by November 2011, D1’s Professional Standards Department (PSD) had become a collaborative function of D1, D2, and D3. Similarly, in April 2013, the Collision Investigation Unit (CIU) became a joint function, with D2 predominantly staffing the unit and hosting it at their Stevenage premises pursuant to S22A of the Police Act 1996. D2 investigated the collision and produced a report.
The Claimant alleges that D2 conspired with D1 to falsify its investigation into the collision. The Claimant alleges that D2’s report substantially replicated statements from D1’s report and concealed the witness statement fabricated by KM.
In November 2014, a mandatory referral of the Claimant's complaint was made to D4. D4, under the provisions of the Police Reform Act (PRA) 2002, determined that D1 would be the ""appropriate authority"" for a ""local investigation"" of the complaint, allowing for a right of appeal to D4. A report of the investigation into the complaint was provided to the Claimant on 2015-March-31.
The Claimant alleges that D3 (specifically, detective superintendent Mark Hodgson) conspired with D1 and D4 to falsify the investigation into his complaint. In April 2015, the Claimant submitted a 14-page appeal letter to D4, including medical records. D4 assigned Emma Byrne (EB) to assess the appeal. The Claimant alleges that EB was part of a conspiracy to falsify the assessment. Ultimately, D4 dismissed the appeal, upholding the findings of the local investigation. This marked the end of D4's direct involvement in the initial stages of the complaint.
The Claimant further alleges that in 2016, D1, D2 and D3 collaborated to provide a heavily redacted version of D1’s collision report in response to a subject access request. The Claimant argues that D1, D2 and D3 used unlawful means to undermine his efforts to find out what had taken place.
The Particulars of Claim assert that in 2018, D1-3’s information access department became a collaborative function provided by D3 at cost to D1 and D2. The Claimant alleges that D3 committed further torts by unlawfully redacting D2’s report and concealing evidence of wrongdoing.
Exhibit GLvB2 contains several versions of the further collision report prepared by D2, with different redactions. The Claimant argues that the redactions in the report, which were made by D1 and D4, show that these defendants are deliberately concealing evidence of wrongdoing. The Claimant also draws attention to an entry in the D2 electronic collision report, dated 2013-October-15, which indicates that the decision was made to take no further action because there were no witnesses. The Claimant suggests that this is evidence of misconduct and concealment of evidence. Exhibit GLVB2 also includes correspondence from D4 relating to the Claimant’s complaint, including a letter in which D4 dismisses his appeal. One version of the collision report was unredacted (perhaps in error) to the extent that it gave the address of an “Other Person Involved” which proved to be the home address of LC.
The conclusions which the claimant draws in relation to D2’s collision reports and the subsequent role of D3 and D4 from this material appear to me to be speculative, contentious and not founded on any reasonable analysis of the documents. They assume rather than prove the conspiracies that the Claimant says must have existed. As the Claimant says in his witness statement D2's report substantially replicated statements from D1’s report. This was inevitable. As the Claimant was informed, D2’s “Camera, Tickets & Collision Unit” had reviewed the available evidence which came almost entirely from the material generated by the police officers who had attended at the scene. There were no cameras recording footage of the incident or an account from the Claimant and, on the face of the initial collision report, no witnesses who contradicted the version of events said to have given by DG. The same observations might be made in relation to D4’s role and the outcome of the investigation into the complaint. As the Claimant acknowledges in his 2nd Witness statement the conduct alleged against D2, D3 and D4 would have involved them in taking “immense objective risks in committing to further D1’s tortious and criminal acts by similar acts of their own”.
Exhibit GLvB3 contains selections from the Claimant’s s medical records. They establish that he suffered a splenic rupture that was not diagnosed until more than five and a half hours after the collision. They also evidence the undisputed fact that he arrived at the hospital by police car and that he underwent emergency surgery. The Claimant accuses the police officers who brought him of deliberately delaying his transport to the hospital with intent to cause his death, amounting to attempted murder. The other way in which the evidence could be viewed is that, having waited for some time for an ambulance to arrive, the police officers took it upon themselves to take the Claimant to hospital because they were concerned for his welfare, had noted that he had a head injury and were worried about the elapse of time. This is not the interpretation which the Claimant places on events but it seems to me to be the more likely reason, and it is the Defendants’ pleaded case based on what is said in the Collision Report, as to why, despite an ambulance having been called, the Claimant arrived at hospital in a police car.
There is no medical evidence to suggest any causative link between delay in taking the Claimant to hospital and the onset of significant symptomology or the emergency treatment required for his injuries. There is, equally, no medical evidence to support a diagnosis of psychiatric illness which he refers to as “undiagnosed and untreated to date”. His Particulars of Claim contain what is referred to as a “diagnostic self-assessment"".
The exhibit, GLvB3 also includes a letter from his GP in which his GP confirms that he could not act as an expert witness. This followed a consultation by telephone which the Claimant had recorded and transcribed. The Claimant characterises his GP’s refusal to assist as an example of “belief bias”. This is indicative of the Claimant’s overall approach to any suggestion that his allegations are irrational or unsubstantiated.
As referred to earlier the Claimant learned of LC's address through the second disclosed version of a police collision report. This version of the report was disclosed to the Claimant by Kathleen Love of D1 on 2016-April-5. The original report, which the Claimant had previously received, had redacted the address of the third ""other person involved"".
As a result of obtaining LC's address, the Claimant visited her home and conducted a covertly recorded interview with her on 2017-January-10. The interview was conducted in the presence of her husband James Coleman and her son Scott Coleman, who also made verbal statements. The Claimant transcribed the interview himself. The Claimant argues that LC's account provided the necessary evidence of damage, causation, and bad faith to support his claim of misfeasance in public office against D1 and that the discovery of his rights of action against D2, D3 and D4 were entirely dependent on the emergence of a basis for a claim against D1.
The Claimant had not produced the recording of the transcript as part of the material on which he relied at the hearing. Had he been legally advised and represented he would almost certainly have done so and for that reason I adjourned the hearing giving him permission to serve a further witness statement exhibiting the recording and the transcript.
On 2023-May-3, the Claimant filed a witness statement exhibiting a transcript and digital copy of the interview with LC. The Defendants filed submissions in response to this further evidence.
The key fact revealed in LC's interview is that she witnessed the Claimant being hit by a car which she describes as going “pretty fast” and having “clipped” the Claimant's bicycle. LC states that she was driving directly behind the car that hit the Claimant and saw the entire event. This contradicts the conclusion in the collision report that the Claimant simply fell off his bicycle.
LC’s son, Scott, was also a passenger in her car and witnessed the collision. He describes seeing the car hit the Claimant and the Claimant being ""sent flying"".
LC immediately stopped her car and confronted the driver of the car that hit the Claimant. She told the driver that he needed to call an ambulance. When the police arrived, LC gave them her account of what happened and provided them with her contact information. She reiterated this information to the same police officers when she returned to the scene a short time later, having dropped her son off. She also heard KM say that the police would take the Claimant to hospital following the ambulance's failure to attend. LC mentions expressly that she told the police everything and gave them her details, but they never contacted her again. She expresses surprise at this, as she believed that she had provided all the necessary information. This lies uneasily with the statement in the collision report that extensive inquiries had been carried out to ascertain if there were any independent witnesses.
The interview is plainly a crucial piece of evidence in the case. It is the only independent account of what happened (other than the statement attributed to DG) and directly challenges D1's version of events. The fact that this interview was conducted covertly, to some extent in a leading fashion, and several years after the incident may raise questions about its reliability but the consistency of LC and her son's accounts, and the fact that LC reported what she had seen to the police at the time, potentially lends weight to the evidence.
The Litigation
On 2022-March-29 the Claimant issued his Claim Form. The claim, as initially set out, was for damages for both misfeasance in public office and negligence, although the negligence claim was later abandoned.
On 2022-March-30 the court, on its own initiative, issued an order staying the proceedings for 28 days and requiring Particulars of Claim compliant with CPR 16.4 and PD16 to be filed within that period.
On 2022-April-23 the Claimant filed his Particulars of Claim. However, the court did not immediately release the Claim Form for service, which was not effected by the court until 2022-August-30, when it was served on all Defendants.
On 2022-September-9 D4 filed an Acknowledgement of Service. On 13th September D1-D3 did likewise followed by a joint defence. D4 has not filed a defence.
On 2022-September-28 D1-D3 filed an application to strike out the claim and on the following day D4 filed an application to strike out the claim or for summary judgment in the alternative.
On 2022-September-30 the Claimant filed a request for default judgment against D1-D3. The court rejected the request, stating, incorrectly it appears, that these Defendants had filed their defences on time.
On 2022-November-18 the Claimant filed an application to strike out the defences of D1-D3 and D4, along with an application for summary judgment against D4. He also filed his supporting witness statement.
The Defendants’ Arguments for Strike Out
The first, second, and third Defendants (D1-D3) argue that the claim should be struck out for the following reasons:
The claim is time-barred. They contend that the claim, which arises from an accident on 2013-August-28, was not issued until 2022-March-29, and not deemed served until 2 September 2022, which is more than three years after the cause of action accrued (that being the relevant limitation period). D1-D3 argue that the last act complained of in relation to them was the investigation report completed on 2015-January-28. They further argue that even if the date of knowledge was 2017-January-10, as the Claimant asserts, the claim would be out of time by 2020-January-10. D1-D3 maintain that there are no grounds to extend time under s.33 of the Limitation Act 1980.
The Particulars of Claim disclose no reasonable grounds for bringing the claim. D1-D3 argue that the Particulars of Claim fail to formulate a complete cause of action. They assert that the allegation of attempted murder is inconsistent with the pleaded primary facts, and that there is no basis for asserting fabrication or concealment by any officer or staff member of D1-D3. They contend that the physical injuries were sustained in the accident and not caused by their alleged misfeasance. D1-D3 also rely on the fact that that no medical evidence is provided to support the claim for psychiatric injury, nor will it be.
The Particulars of Claim constitute an abuse of process. D1-D3 argue that the lack of expert medical evidence for physical or psychological injuries means the claim is an abuse of process. D1-D3 assert that the Claimant is unwilling or unable to provide a concise statement of facts and the particulars of claim are simply too long and incoherent.
The Claimant has failed to comply with a court order. They argue that the particulars of claim do not comply with the order of 2022-March-29, which required a concise statement of facts.
The claim is totally without merit. D1-D3 seek an order confirming that the claim is totally without merit.
The fourth Defendant (D4) argues that the claim should be struck out for the following reasons:
The claims against D4 are presented beyond the relevant limitation period and are statute barred. D4 also contends that the claim for personal injuries arising from the alleged misfeasance in public office is subject to a three-year limitation period. D4 argues that the Claimant was aware of a potential cause of action against D4 in April 2017, or alternatively April 2018. Therefore, the three-year limitation period for a personal injury claim expired in April 2021. The claim form was not issued until 2022-March-29. D4 also argues that there is no good reason to extend time for the claims against D4 under s.33 of the Limitation Act 1980.
The Claimant has failed adequately to particularise his claims. D4 asserts that the Particulars of Claim are inadequate and prevent or hinder D4 from being able to plead a defence. They are prolix, repetitive, confusing, contradictory and fail to provide a concise statement of facts. D4 argues that they fail to properly identify the allegations against D4 or plead the necessary elements of the cause of action. The missing elements include the powers being exercised, who exercised the power, and what act was done that was unlawful and with the requisite state of mind. D4 also contends that the claims of unjust enrichment, acquisition of false reputation, and unlawful acquisition of power are insufficiently particularised and not causes of action open to the Claimant on the facts.
The claim for physical damages is misconceived. D4 argues that the Claimant's claim that ""the Defendants"" caused his physical injuries is incorrect, because D4 had no involvement with the Claimant at the time of his accident.
The Claimant has failed to adequately plead the claim for personal injuries. D4 claims that the Claimant fails to include a reference to a CPR compliant medical report to support his claim. D4 does not accept the fact or extent of the Claimant’s psychiatric injuries which are unsupported by medical opinion.
The Claimant's application is misconceived. D4 argues that the Claimant's application for summary judgment is primarily a reply to D4's application and should be dismissed. Further the Claimant may not obtain default judgment when there is a pending application for an order to strike out or summary judgment of the Claimant’s case.
D4 also argues that the allegations made by the Claimant against Mr Trott, the solicitor with conduct of the case on behalf of D4, are baseless and a collateral attack on D4's response to the claim. As far as this is concerned, I agree. The Claimant’s suggestion that Mr Trott has improperly signed D4’s application notice or has an undeclared conflict of interest is simply wrong.
The Claimant’s Arguments
The Claimant’s arguments in response to the applications and in support of his own were not always easy to understand but I think may fairly be summarised as follows:
The claim is not statute-barred. The Claimant argues that D4 has failed to plead a defence, and cannot rely on limitation to terminate the claim by strike-out or summary judgment. The Claimant also asserts that D1-3 cannot rely on limitation because the particulars of claim would remain in his action against D4. The Claimant argues that his claim is for misfeasance in public office, and not negligence, therefore the limitation period would be six years rather than three. Additionally, the Claimant argues that the Defendants' actions constitute a continuing tort, meaning that the limitation period has not expired.
The Claimant argues that a cause of action in misfeasance accrued no sooner than 10 January 2017. This is the date he interviewed LC whose statements evidence the damage, causation, and bad faith elements of the claim. Until that time there was active concealment.
He argues that the discovery of rights of action against D2, D3 and D4 was entirely dependent on this first discovery regarding D1. Whilst the Claimant does acknowledge that he believed his symptoms met all diagnostic criteria for PTSD by May 2014, he asserts that he had no ""contemporaneous knowledge"" of those symptoms. He states that he first believed he had PTSD in October 2017. He also states that he was only aware of what he claims were symptoms of psychiatric illness in 2013 and again in April 2014.
Misfeasance in public office is the sole cause of action. The Claimant asserts that all Defendants are liable in the tort of misfeasance and that the Particulars of claim formulate a complete cause of action against them.
The Claimant contends that D1-3's defence consists of bare denials and is incoherent, disclosing no reasonable grounds in fact or law, and is an abuse of court process. The Claimant also argues that the Defendants have failed to comply with the rules.
The Defendants do not have a real prospect of successfully defending the claim. The Claimant argues that D1-3's statement of case denies every allegation in the Particulars of claim without explanation and is incoherent and incorrect.
The Particulars of Claim identify cause-effect relationships between the Defendants' actions and his psychiatric impacts. The Claimant maintains that the probability that the events which have taken place in his life could have occurred in the absence of severe psychiatric damage is very low. He therefore asserts that no further assessment of loss is needed.
The Claimant argues that he has filed all necessary documents. The Claimant’s Particulars of Claim filed on 2022-April-23 complied with all court orders.
The Defendants' actions demonstrate bad faith. The Claimant believes that the Defendants are conducting proceedings in bad faith and that their acts are entirely consistent with their tortious conduct.
The Limitation Chronology
Against this background the key dates in relation to the limitation arguments are as follows:
2013-August-28: The accident occurred, giving rise to the Claimant's initial injuries (although not the alleged psychiatric injury).
2014-August-25: The Claimant submitted a formal complaint about the conduct of D1. The Defendants argue this demonstrates the Claimant's awareness of a potential claim well before the six-year limitation for tort claims expired.
2015-January-28: The investigation report concerning the accident was completed. The Defendants argue that this marks the last act complained of in relation to D1-3, setting the latest possible date for the accrual of the cause of action against them.
2015-June-18: The Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) dismissed the Claimant’s appeal and upheld the findings of the local investigation. This marks the last substantive involvement of the IOPC (D4) with the Claimant’s appeal.
2017-January-10: The Claimant asserts that this date marks the earliest possible date for the accrual of the cause of action for misfeasance in public office. He bases this argument on Section 32(1)(b) of the Limitation Act 1980, which postpones the limitation period in cases of deliberate concealment of facts relevant to a plaintiff’s right of action.
February 2017: The Claimant decided to proceed as a litigant in person against D1. The Defendants rely on this as further evidence of the Claimant's recognition of a potential claim.
April 2017: The Claimant states that he first became aware of a prima facie claim against D4 (the IOPC) during this month.
April 2018: Alternatively, the Claimant suggests that he first discovered a prima facie claim against D4 in April 2018.
2016-August-28: This marks the expiration of the primary limitation period for a personal injury claim under section 11 of the Limitation Act 1980.
2019-August-28: This marks the expiration of the limitation period for a tort claim under section 2 of the Limitation Act 1980.
2022-March-29: The Claim Form was issued, initiating the legal proceedings. This date falls outside both the three-year and six-year primary limitation periods.
Discussion and Conclusions
The first issue is, logically, which period of limitation applies to the claim. Section 2 of the Limitation Act 1980 sets a six-year limitation period for claims in tort, while Section 11 specifies a three-year limitation period for claims for personal injury. A v Hoare [2008] UKHL 6 was a landmark case that addressed the issue of limitation periods in personal injury claims, particularly those involving intentional torts. The House of Lords considered several appeals relating to claims of sexual abuse, some of which were brought against public officials, and sought to clarify the interpretation of section 11 of the Limitation Act 1980.
The central issue was whether the phrase ""negligence, nuisance, or breach of duty"" in section 11(1) of the Limitation Act 1980 included intentional torts causing personal injury, or if it was limited to unintentional acts like negligence. Prior to A v Hoare, the House of Lords had held in Stubbings v Webb [1993] AC 498 that section 11 did not apply to deliberate acts of trespass.
In A v Hoare , the House of Lords confirmed that the three-year limitation period in Section 11 applies to all claims for personal injury, including those arising from intentional torts. Lord Hoffmann's judgment identified several reasons for the change of course.  He traced the phrase ""negligence, nuisance or breach of duty"" in the 1980 Act back to earlier legislation, noting consistent judicial interpretation that included intentional torts within ""breach of duty."" He thought it was ""inconceivable"" that Parliament, when enacting the 1975 Act that led on to the 1980 Act, intended to exclude victims of intentional torts from the benefits of a potentially extendable limitation period. He recognised the ""anomalies"" created by Stubbings v Webb, where victims of abuse could sue negligent institutions but not their abusers. He thought it unjust to deny these victims access to justice due to a restrictive interpretation of the limitation period.
The Claimant has consistently argued that the actions of the Defendants led to physical and psychiatric injuries. The pleadings clearly indicate that the Claimant is claiming damages for pain, suffering and loss of amenity. The nature of the tort, misfeasance in public office, does not remove it from the scope of section 11, as A v Hoare made clear. It follows in my view that the claim is subject to the primary three-year limitation period applicable to personal injury litigation. There is no residual claim which falls within a six period; all of the claims arise from or are parasitic on the personal injury claim. Although the Defendants fairly raised and discussed the point at the hearing, there are evident difficulties in framing the case as one for a loss of a chance of pursuing the driver of the vehicle which the Claimant alleges collided with him and that is not, in any event, the way in which the claim is articulated.
The Claimant argued that the tort of misfeasance in public office should be considered a continuing tort, such that the limitation period should be calculated from the last instance of the tortious conduct. In Escott v Tunbridge Wells Borough Council [2016] EWHC 2793the court acknowledged that there may be situations in which a tort continues due to ongoing acts of bad faith but that simply continuing to suffer a loss due to a prior action does not constitute a continuing tort. In Escott the court held that the continuing loss suffered as a result of the defendant's action did not make the conduct complained of a continuing tort, which in principle is, in my view, the appropriate analysis in this case. Further, a sequential consideration of the last acts of which the Claimant complains does not, ultimately, assist his limitation arguments.
A v Hoare also addressed the meaning of ""significant injury"" under section 14(2) of the Limitation Act 1980. The court clarified that the test of significance is objective: a claimant's injury is considered significant if a reasonable person, with the claimant's knowledge of the facts, would consider the injury sufficiently serious to justify instituting proceedings for damages against a defendant who would not dispute liability and would be able to satisfy a judgment. The court clarified that any consideration of how a claimant's personal characteristics or their psychological state impacted their ability to bring a claim is a matter for the court's discretion under Section 33. The Claimant’s case as to when and what injury he was aware of is at best opaque and the difficulties of making any assessment are compounded by the absence of any medical evidence.
Section 32 of the Limitation Act 1980 provides that where a defendant has deliberately concealed any fact relevant to the claimant’s cause of action, the limitation period will not begin to run until the claimant has discovered the concealment, or could with reasonable diligence have discovered it. The Court of Appeal in Arcadia Group Brands Ltd (in administration) v Visa Inc [2015] EWCA Civ 883 clarified that the concealed fact must be one which is “essential for [the claimant] to prove in order to establish a prima facie case in his cause of action.”. The question of whether there was such concealment is of course the central allegation on which the alleged tort is founded. It is not one that I can decide in the context of the applications before me despite the Claimant’s arguments to the contrary.
However section 14(1) of the 1980 Act also requires knowledge that the injury was attributable to the defendant's actions. Although the Claimant made a complaint in 2014 and received some disclosure from D1 in 2016 I am prepared to accept, on the material before me for the applications, that this did not provide the Claimant with sufficient knowledge of the essential facts of his cause of action, specifically, on his case, that he was struck by a car and that LC had made a statement to this effect to the police (these being the essential facts that the Claimant asserts had been concealed from him). Considering all of the evidence, I conclude that the Claimant's date of knowledge in respect of a claim against D1, for the purposes of section 14 of the Limitation Act 1980, is 10 January 2017, the date on which he obtained the crucial interview with LC.  I consider that he had proceeded with reasonable diligence in investigating his claim up to that point. For this purpose, I also accept that the relevant injury is the psychological disturbance caused to the Claimant by his suspicion that information known to the police officers was being withheld and falsified.  I further accept that, notwithstanding his earlier complaints and enquiries, any action against the other defendants was necessarily dependent upon establishing his case against D1. Nevertheless, even with that later date of knowledge the claim was not issued within the applicable limitation period.
In Richards v McKeown & another [2017] EWCA Civ 2374, the Court of Appeal held that the lower courts had erred in striking out a negligence claim, including a personal injury claim, on limitation grounds when the defendants had not specifically pleaded a limitation defence. The judgment emphasised the importance of procedural fairness and the need for defendants to clearly articulate their reliance on limitation arguments in their pleadings. On behalf of D4, Mr Thomas conceded that in raising this argument the Claimant had “a fair point”. In fact it appears to me to be a fatal one as far as any reliance on limitation by D4 is concerned. This is of course only one of the grounds on which D4 seeks to strike out the claim.
In contrast Limitation defences are pleaded and available to D1, D2 and D3. As the Defendants acknowledged that is subject to the potential application of section 33 of the 1980 Act which gives the court discretion to extend the limitation period. Section 33(3) sets out specific factors that the court must consider including the length of the delay, the reasons for it and the extent to which evidence is likely to be less cogent as a result. Questions as to the cogency of evidence may well fall to be addressed in the context of the Claimant's case that material was withheld from him. The Defendants’ conduct is also part of the balancing exercise. The psychological impact of the injury on the Claimant is also a relevant factor. The court's discretion is wide, allowing it to consider all of the relevant factors to ensure a just outcome. In the present case the Claimant is a litigant in person who had concluded that his claim was subject to a six year limitation period. On his own account he clearly fell into an increasingly severe disturbance of the mind in the years following his accident, which is consistent with the behaviour which the Defendants complain of. His case is that this was precipitated by the Defendants’ actions. The exercise of the discretion is inextricably linked in this case to whether or not there was an attempt at active concealment.
The tort of misfeasance in public office is established when a public officer, acting in their official capacity, acts (or fails to act) in a way that constitutes a breach of their public duty and causes harm to the claimant. The leading case on misfeasance in public office is Three Rivers District Council v Governor and Company of The Bank of England [2023] 2 AC 1 (“Three Rivers”). In Three Rivers, the House of Lords held that the claimant must show that the public officer acted (i) in the exercise of a public power or duty, (ii) with malice, (iii) causing damage to the claimant. The malice element can be satisfied either through (i) targeted malice, where the defendant intends to harm the claimant specifically, or (ii) untargeted malice, where the defendant acts knowing that they have no power to do so and that they are likely to cause harm to a class of persons to which the claimant belongs. The constituent elements of the tort have to be addressed expressly in pleading a claim relying on misfeasance.
The Claimant asserts that the Defendants have acted in bad faith throughout, by conspiring against him. In  Carter v Chief Constable of Cumbria Police [2008] EWHC 1072 (QB) the court emphasised the importance of properly particularising allegations of bad faith when asserting a claim for misfeasance in public office. Tugendhat J highlighted the gravity of misfeasance allegations, observing that they are among the most serious accusations that can be levelled against public officials, aside from claims of dishonesty (which are also made in this case). He noted that such allegations must be supported by specific and detailed facts. Vague or general assertions of bad faith, without sufficient factual backing, will be vulnerable to being struck out by the court.
CPR 3.4(2) provides that the court may strike out a statement of case if it appears to the court that: (a) the statement of case discloses no reasonable grounds for bringing or defending the claim; (b) the statement of case is an abuse of the court’s process or is otherwise likely to obstruct the just disposal of the proceedings; or (c) there has been a failure to comply with a rule, practice direction or court order.
The Particulars of Claim are lengthy and in two parts (the first pleading being referred to as “provisional”). Part 6 of the second pleading is headed “ALLEGATIONS OF FAULT In the Tort of Misfeasance in Public Office”. An example of the way in which the claim is adavanced against individuals is as follows:
The Tortfeasor and Unnamed Manager of the Collisions Investigation Unit (“MCIU”) –
6.1.5.1 was a public officer at the time of his or her tort in 2013;
6.1.5.2 committed the tort in the course of exercising his or her public powers as an officer of D2 or as a civilian employee under D2’s direction and control;
6.1.5.3 intended to cause me the losses particularised in 7.1.1 and 7.2.4.4 of this document; intended to cause me an unknown proportion of the losses particularised in 7.2.1 of this document.
Particulars of Allegations against MCIU
6.1.6.1 MCIU gave multiple orders to 2 other operatives of D2 in the course of committing the tort.
6.1.6.2 MCIU concealed a witness statement fabricated by KM.
6.1.6.3 MCIU knew that I had suffered actionable loss in advance of his or her tort.
6.1.6.4 MCIU conspired with operatives of D1 to cause the stated losses.
6.1.6.5 The losses caused by MCIU under 7.2.1 are unknown because novi actus interveniebant.”
This might fairly be described as a series of assertions. No particulars are given of how the alleged knowledge on the part of this individual arose, why a particular intention is to be imputed to them, what steps or actions are relied upon in support of the allegation that there was concealment or a conspiracy and what instructions or orders were given to other participants. If paragraph 6.1.6.5 is meant to plead a break in the chain of causation then it is wholly unclear what is being referred to or relied upon. These deficiencies are not cured by the earlier factual narrative at Part 3 of the Particulars of Claim which allege that MCIU received and archived a “manifestly fabricated witness statement” and informed the Claimant when the investigation had been completed.
The Particulars of Claim lack necessary specificity, particularly with regard to the powers exercised, the individuals involved, the dates of the alleged misconduct, the evidence of bad faith, and the factual basis for each element of the tort. The Claimant has failed to provide any evidence of any specific act of misfeasance carried out by D2 and D3 other than seeking to conceal the original, alleged, wrongdoing of D1’s officers. However, that case is entirely predicated on the assertion that D2 and D3 were aware that a statement had, on the Claimant’s case, been fabricated and a false account given in the collision report. There is no pleaded case as to why these Defendants had actual or imputed knowledge of any of these matters. It is implausible that a police officer who had falsely completed a collision report and manufactured evidence would disclose that fact to another police officer, let alone to other police forces. The Claimant appears to acknowledge the enormity of the allegations that he is making but does not baulk at alleging that each individual who came into contact with his case or was involved in reviewing it within the D1, D2 and D3 police forces was party to the conspiracy and acted dishonestly. But a bare allegation is not sufficient.
The Particulars of Claim are also overly long and fail to comply with the Court's order of 2022-March-29 to provide a concise statement of facts. The lack of medical evidence contributes to the difficulty in understanding what actions have led to what injury, particularly in the case of D2, D3 and D4. The requirement to serve a medical report is, however, not absolute and I think it is tolerably clear that the Claimant’s mental health has been impacted by his initial suspicions, whether paranoid or well founded, that information was being withheld from him.
As far as D1 is concerned, there is no realistic prospect in this case that any court would conclude that D1's officers had made an attempt to kill the Claimant because they disliked cyclists.  None of the pleaded facts give rise to any such inference and the motive suggested is absurd. The only rational conclusion is that the police and others were seeking to assist and obtain prompt medical treatment.
The involvement of D4, as an oversight body, was limited to referring the Claimant’s complaint to a local investigation by Cambridgeshire Police and then dismissing the Claimant’s appeal against that investigation. There is no pleaded basis on which it could be inferred that D4 knew that there had been any concealment of evidence or falsification of reports. There is nothing to suggest that D4 acted with the requisite malice to establish misfeasance in public office. Moreover, the Claimant’s Particulars of Claim do not adequately plead how D4's actions (or inactions) caused him damage.
Whilst the Defendants acknowledge that the recording of the conversation with LC is evidence supporting the Claimant's case that does not alter the complexion of the case as against D2, D3 and D4. No properly pleaded case is advanced by the Claimant that these Defendants knew that LC had witnessed a collision between the Claimant and a car or that they knew that she had told the police officers at the scene that she had done so. There is no reason why any review of the investigation conducted by D1 should have led them to that conclusion, not least because it is the Claimant’s case that KM had sought to suppress the material facts from the outset. Whilst the Particulars of Claim assert that KM and FCRI made “confessions” no basis is given for this contention and there is no identification of what the Claimant relies on in advancing it.
I conclude in the circumstances that the statement of case discloses no reasonable grounds for bringing the claim against D2, D3 and D4 and that there has been a failure to comply with a court order. The claims against D2, D3, and D4 should be struck out. It follows that the Claimant’s applications against these Defendants have not succeeded and are dismissed.
The position in relation to D1 is different. The covert recording of LC’s interview and the comparison of handwriting raise a genuine issue regarding the potential fabrication of a witness statement and suppression of evidence by KM. That is at least part of the case pleaded against D1 and can be salvaged from the broader allegations involving the unsustainable contention that there was an attempt to kill the Claimant by delaying his treatment and a subsequent conspiracy with other Defendants. The Claimant has demonstrated that he is entitled to pursue his case to this limited extent. I conclude that this claim is contained within the present pleading. Notwithstanding the deficiencies in the pleading D1 has understood this to be the Claimant’s case since it is essentially encapsulated in the second proposition to which D1 suggested the claim could be reduced, namely: “D1’s officers deliberately falsified the record/ investigation of the incident to conceal the existence of a collision between a motor car and the Claimant’s bicycle which knocked him off his bicycle”. There is a clear public interest in ensuring that allegations of serious wrongdoing by police officers should be heard by the courts where there are reasonable grounds for bringing a claim.
I am however persuaded that the Particulars of Claim should be struck out other than in so far as they set out such a claim. It also follows that the Claimant’s application as against D1 is dismissed. I do not think it appropriate or necessary to certify that the claim or any part of it is totally without merit.
Given the history of this matter and the Claimant’s approach it may be ambitious to expect the Claimant to reformulate his claim without generating argument and costs.  That may be avoided by identifying a preliminary issue. In the circumstances the appropriate case management orders are  that the claim should proceed, at this stage, as to liability only and should be listed for the trial of an issue as to whether KM deliberately falsified the record/ investigation of the incident to conceal the existence of a collision between a motor car and the Claimant’s bicycle and to determine whether the court should extend the limitation period pursuant to s.33 of the Limitation Act 1980.
The Defendants should prepare and lodge a draft order for approval giving effect to this judgment, agreed if possible, but otherwise accompanied by short written submissions on consequential matters that cannot be agreed.

His Honour Judge Middleton-Roy:
Anonymity
In line with the Practice Guidance of the President of the Family Division issued in December 2018, the names of the child and the adult parties in this judgment have been anonymised, having regard to the implications for the child of placing personal details and information in the public domain. The anonymity of the child and members of their family must be strictly preserved. All persons, including representatives of the media, must ensure that this condition is strictly complied with. Failure to do so will be a contempt of Court and may result in a sentence of imprisonment.
The Court is concerned with a young person who will be referred to in this judgment as ‘V’. He is a 15-year-old boy with profound enduring disabilities. He is a looked after child who is the subject of a Care Order.
This short judgment is delivered orally on an extempore basis at the conclusion of a hearing in a busy National Deprivation of Liberty List in the Royal Courts of Justice. It is published as the request of the Local Authority.
The Local Authority, Rochdale City Council, applies pursuant to s.100 of the Children Act 1989 for leave to invoke the inherent jurisdiction of the High Court and for a Deprivation of Liberty Order. The Local Authority seeks a declaration from the Court that it is lawful and the best interests of ‘V’ for the Local Authority to be permitted to deprive him of his liberty pursuant to Article 5 of the European Convention on Human Rights (“ECHR”) and to avoiding breaching ‘V’s Article 2 ECHR right to life and his Article 3 ECHR rights prohibiting torture, inhuman or degrading treatment.
‘V’s mother was not in attendance nor legally represented at this hearing. She was served with notice of the hearing. It is understood she supports the Local Authority’s application.
‘V’s father was not in attendance nor legally represented. His views on the Local Authority’s application are not known.
The Guardian sought a short adjournment of the application to allow her to meet with ‘V’.
Having expressed at the outset of the hearing the Court’s preliminary observation that the application did not on its facts meet the test for the High Court to invoke its inherent jurisdiction, Counsel for the Local Authority and the Solicitor for the Guardian helpfully confirmed that they were in a position to make submissions and for the Court to determine the preliminary legal issue having regard to the familiar legal authorities.
There is a considerable background of concern in respect of ‘V’. He is a highly vulnerable young person with complex medical needs. He was diagnosed with microcephaly shortly after birth. He is described as having severe quadriplegic cerebral palsy, epilepsy and profound learning disabilities. He is registered blind. He is doubly incontinent. He had a tracheostomy and receives oxygen through a tube inserted into his trachea. He requires regular nebulisers and physiotherapy to support his chest management and secretion levels. Moreover, he has bi-lateral dislocated hips. He has no independent functional movement and requires hoisting equipment for all transfers. He is not able to mobilise and uses a wheelchair. Further, he requires support with position changes as part of his chest management.
The Local Authority applies to this Court for authority to impose restrictions including two-to-one or one-to-one supervision at all times, including when ‘V’ is transported by vehicle and when he is in the community, to be supported with his personal care including intimate care and to be monitored in his room by voice monitor and physical checks. Further, the Local Authority sought authorisation from the Court to supervise the use of ‘V’s mobile phone. The Local Authority accepted in submissions that no deprivation authorisation from the Court was necessary in respect of the proposed restrictions on ‘V’s mobile phone use, this being an appropriate exercise of the Local Authority’s Parental Responsibility for ‘V’ under the existing Care Order.
A previous Deprivation of Liberty Order was made in the local Family Court by a section 9 Judge in November 2023. In that Order, the Court granted permission to the Local Authority to invoke the inherent jurisdiction. The Court then proceeded to make declarations that it was lawful for the Local Authority to deprive ‘V’ of his liberty, in the same terms as the Local Authority now seeks before this Court. That Order was made prior to the decision of Mrs Justice Lieven in the case of Peterborough City Council v SM [2024] EWHC 493 (Fam)
The Local Authority submits that ‘V’s case is distinguishable from the case of SM, primarily as in that case, the subject child could not communicate in any form and did not understand language. The Local Authority submits that ‘V’ has limited communication and understanding but can express happiness, sadness and pain.
People with disabilities have the same human rights as those without disabilities. ‘V’s profound disabilities place a duty on the State to make reasonable accommodation and cater for his particular needs.  The measures put in place by the Local Authority to support ‘V’, on a proper fact-specific analysis, form part of ‘V’s care provision. ‘V’ is undoubtedly under close and constant supervision. However, in this Court’s judgement, the measures implemented by the Local Authority are not actions of the State which deprive ‘V’ of his liberty. They are designed to meet his care needs. There are many aspects of ‘V’s care which may intrude on his privacy, with specific justification, but they are not, in this Court’s judgement, interferences with his important right to liberty and security of person under Article 5 of the European Convention on Human Rights.
Respectfully, this Court disagrees with the submission that there is any material distinction of the principle in SM this current case. The young person, ‘V’ who is at the centre of this case, requires support because of his profound disabilities. In practical terms, ‘V’ cannot leave his care placement of his own volition, due to his enduring disabilities. For ‘V’, the reason he can’t leave his care placement and requires intimate support is because of those disabilities, not by reason of any action of the State. For the same reasons articulated by Lieven J in SM, the facts of this case show that the State is not depriving ‘V’ of his right to liberty and security of person within the meaning of Article 5 ECHR.  ‘V’s Article 2, 3 and 5 rights are not infringed by the restrictions necessarily implemented by the Local Authority to supervise him, monitor him and provide for his personal care.
Nothing in this decision is intended to take away from the fact that this Local Authority is providing suitable care for ‘V’ and is responding appropriately to his complex needs. This is not, however, a case where the Local Authority requires a permissive Order from the Court. This is not a case where it is necessary for the High Court to grant leave to exercise its inherent jurisdiction.  In this Court’s judgement, a Deprivation of Liberty Order is not necessary.
For these reasons, the Local Authority’s application for permission under s100 Children Act 1989 is refused.

MRS JUSTICE HILL
Mrs Justice Hill:
Introduction
By a claim issued on 19 July 2023 the Claimants (“C1”, “C2”, “C3” and “C4” respectively) bring proceedings for harassment, defamation, malicious falsehood and various privacy-related claims (Footnote: 1) against the four Defendants (“D1”, “D2”, “D3” and “D4” respectively). D1 is an individual. The claims against him rely heavily on internet posts on various websites for which it is said D2, D3 and D4 are responsible.
By an order dated 24 October 2023, Master Stevens held that England and Wales was the most appropriate forum for the litigation. The Master granted the Claimants permission to serve the Claim Form and if required any other documents on the Defendants outside of the jurisdiction, in the United States of America. D4 is based in the state of Oregon in the United States.
This is my judgment on:
The Claimants’ application dated 2 August 2023 against D4 for further information under CPR Part 18 (“the Part 18 Application”);
The Claimants’ application dated 9 October 2024 against D4 for an order under the Defamation Act 2013 (“the 2013 Act”), s.13 (“the Section 13 Application”);
D4’s application dated 27 November 2024 challenging jurisdiction under CPR Part 11 and the Claimants’ application dated 5 December 2024 to dismiss D4’s CPR Part 11 application as being totally without merit (together, “the Jurisdiction Applications”); and
D4’s application dated 20 December 2024 for relief from sanctions and/or a retrospective extension of time for the filing of its Acknowledgment of Service (“the Relief from Sanctions Application”).
The Claimants are representing themselves. At the hearing before me on 12 December 2024 C1 and C2 required the assistance of an interpreter. C4 joined the hearing remotely. C1 and C3 made submissions on behalf of all four Claimants.
D4 is represented by solicitors, and leading and junior counsel, who have been of considerable assistance.
The Claimants’ claims in overview
C1 had been a legal academic in China for many years before her retirement in January 2022. By then she was a professor of law at Shenzhen University. C2 is a lawyer practising in a law firm in Beijing. C1 and C2 are the parents of C3. C3 has been in a romantic relationship with C4 since July 2022.
C4 was previously in a relationship with D1. It is the Claimants’ case that rather than respecting C4’s decision to reject his marriage proposal and end their relationship, D1 has subjected her, C3 and his parents to the torts alleged. The Claimants allege that D1 has attended uninvited at the homes of C1, C2 and C3 in England and C4 in the Ukraine and harassed them.
The Claimants also claim that D1 has extensively defamed them on the internet, thereby harassing them further. They rely on many hundreds (Footnote: 2) of posts on three websites, mostly dating from November 2022 to March 2023. The websites are: https://www.6park.com, http://wenxuecity.com and https://fishandchips.fans.
The posts are said to defame the Claimants by, for example, alleging that C1 and C2 have committed criminal offences and by casting various aspersions on the characters of C3 and C4. The posts are also said to involve the disclosure of personal data about C1, C2 and C3 in the form of Land Registry documentation about the three properties they own in Manchester; and photos of cars believed to belong to C3.
The Claimants contend that D1’s actions have damaged all their reputations and had a serious adverse impact on C2’s health such that in October 2022 he had a heart attack, suffers from depression and is unable to work. The Claimants seek damages of £950,000.
The Claimants’ case is that D2, D3 and D4 respectively are the companies responsible for the three websites. The Claimants seek damages from the three Defendants as well as orders identifying who posted the material in question other than D1 and orders to delete the material.
The extent of the Claimants’ pleaded case against D4 is that they were responsible for the https://fishandchips.fans website. At paragraph 46 of her eleventh witness statement, C1 summarised the case against D4 as being that they “provided the platform to publish and disseminate the defamatory statements and articles”, “condoned the continued dissemination of defamatory statements, over a period of four months”, “turned a blind eye” and “never took any monitoring measures”.
Although some of the Claimants’ documents suggest that they bring claims of malicious falsehood and breach of privacy against D4, the hearing before me proceeded on the basis that the Claimants’ claim against D4 is primarily a defamation claim.
Certain aspects of the procedural history
On 24 October 2023 the Master granted the Claimants permission to serve the Claim Form on the Defendants in the United States; and an additional four months to do so.
On 30 March 2024 D1 was served with the proceedings. He failed to file an Acknowledgment of Service or a Defence to any part of the claim by the required deadline. Accordingly on 28 May 2024 the Claimants applied for, and on 10 June 2024 obtained, default judgment against D1. D1 has so far not engaged with these proceedings at all.
On 8 July 2024 the court’s Foreign Process Department informed the Claimants that it had not been possible to serve the claim on D4 as the address given to the process server was incorrect, and no other postal address for D4 was discoverable by the Claimants. However, they had been communicating with D4 by email for over a year.
Accordingly on 10 July 2024 the Claimants applied for, and on 20 September 2024 obtained, an order from the Master permitting them to serve the claim on D4 by email. Three email addresses for D4 were given. The order provided that service would be deemed effective on the date the communication was sent; and gave D4 22 days to serve an Acknowledgment of Service. By a second order of the same date the Master retrospectively extended time for service of the Claim Form from 19 May 2024 to 20 October 2024.
On 22 September 2024, the Claimants served the Claim Form and Particulars of Claim on D4.
At 4.16 pm on 27 November 2024 D4 filed their Acknowledgment of Service with the court. At 9.57 pm on the same day they filed their application challenging jurisdiction under CPR Part 11. D4 accepted that their Acknowledgement of Service should have been filed by 14 October 2024 and that accordingly when it was filed, it was 44 days late.
It is a hallmark of this litigation that the Claimants have made a vast number of applications; correspond with the court very regularly; and routinely provide the court with voluminous documentation, the relevance of which is not always immediately apparent, and sometimes without permission to do so.
It was partly because of their conduct of the litigation in this way that the hearing on 12 December 2024 was limited to considering the applications referred to at [3(i)-(iii)] above. There had, in fact, been a series of other applications listed for consideration at the hearing; and the Claimants and other parties invited the court to consider yet further applications at the hearing. The hearing was also intended to deal with the disposal of the claim against D1, in relation to which the Claimants had filed some 15 volumes of evidence.
By my order dated 16 December 2024, amended under the slip rule on 17 December 2024, the issues as between the Claimants and D1, and the issues as between the Claimants and D2 and D3, will be considered at separate hearings.
Despite the fact that the Claimants had filed extensive documentation on the jurisdiction issue (see [54]-[57] below), I acceded to their request that they be permitted to serve further written submissions on the legal issues after the hearing. D4 responded to these and made their Relief from Sanctions Application. The Claimants then provided evidence in response to that application (and further evidence that did not, but which I have nevertheless taken into account).
The Claimants and D4 were content for the Relief from Sanctions Application to be determined without a hearing and in my judgment that is appropriate. Accordingly, both CPR 23.8(1)(b) and (c), permitting the application to be determined without a hearing, are satisfied.
The order in which the applications should be considered
The Claimants’ case is that because D4’s Acknowledgement of Service was filed late, they are precluded from advancing their jurisdiction challenge. D4’s position is that if their jurisdiction challenge succeeds, there is no basis on which the court could allow the Section 13 Application or the Part 18 Application.
Accordingly, it is appropriate to consider the Relief from Sanctions Application first, followed by the Jurisdiction Applications and then the Section 13 and Part 18 Applications.
The Relief from Sanctions Application
The context of the application
CPR 11(5) makes provision for a Defendant to be deemed to have submitted to the jurisdiction of England and Wales. This requires both that they have filed an Acknowledgment of Service and that they have not made a CPR Part 11 application within the following 14 days: Hoddinott v Persimmon Homes [2008] 1 WLR 806 at [27]. Here, D4 did file an Acknowledgment of Service and filed its CPR Part 11 application later the same day. On that basis, D4 cannot be deemed to have submitted to the jurisdiction.
The Claimants disputed this analysis, on the basis that where an Acknowledgment of Service is filed late, there is an implied sanction that a CPR Part 11 application cannot be made. This is because CPR 11(2) provides that a defendant who wishes to make such an application must first file an Acknowledgment of Service “in accordance with [CPR] Part 10”. Part 10 sets out the relevant time limits.
D4’s primary position was that this was incorrect and that sanctions cannot properly be “implied” into CPR 11(2) because there is another express sanction for failure to file an Acknowledgment of Service in time (namely “default judgment if Part 12 allows it”: see CPR 10.2). Reliance was placed on the observations of Birss LJ in Lufthansa Technik AG v Panasonic Avionics Corp [2024] 1 WLR 2012 at [20]-[22] and Yesss (A) Electrical Ltd v Warren [2024] EWCA Civ 14 at [29]-[31] for the proposition that implying sanctions in this way requires a “high hurdle” which is not met in this scenario. On that basis there is no “sanction” from which any relief is needed.
That said, D4 recognised that there is some first instance authority supporting the Claimants’ argument, namely Talos Capital [2014] EWHC 3977 (Comm) at [30]-[34], per Flaux J (as he then was); Taylor v Giovanni Developers [2015] EWHC 328 (Comm) at [13]-[18], per Popplewell J (as he then was); and Cunico Resources [2019] 1 WLR 2881 at [27]-[34] and [65]-[66], per Andrew Baker J. While expressly preserving their position that these decisions are wrong for argument in the Court of Appeal if necessary, D4 made the Relief from Sanctions Application to protect their position.
The legal principles relevant to relief from sanctions
CPR 3.9 provides as follows:
“Relief from sanctions
On an application for relief from any sanction imposed for a failure to comply with any rule, practice direction or court order, the court will consider all the circumstances of the case, so as to enable it to deal justly with the application, including the need –
for litigation to be conducted efficiently and at proportionate cost; and
to enforce compliance with rules, practice directions and orders.
An application for relief must be supported by evidence.”
In Denton and ors v TH White Ltd and ors [2014] EWCA Civ 906, [2014] WLR 3926 at [40] the Court of Appeal made clear that a judge should address an application for relief from sanctions in three stages. The first stage is to identify and assess the “seriousness and significance” of the “failure to comply with any rule, practice direction or court order” which engages CPR 3.9(1). If the breach is neither serious nor significant, the court is “unlikely to need to spend much time on the second and third stages”. The second stage is to consider why the default occurred. The third stage is to evaluate “all the circumstances of the case, so as to enable [the court] to deal justly with the application including factors (a) and (b) [in rule 39(1)]”.
The evidence on the application
D4 relied on the second witness statement from their solicitor Annabel Thomas dated 20 December 2024 which set out the reasons for the failure to file the Acknowledgment of Service in time and the basis on which relief from sanctions was sought.
Ms Thomas’s evidence was that those working for D4 in the United States on whom the claim had been served had not appreciated that valid service had been effected. This was because (i) D4 had received a “slew of communications” from the Claimants, some of which were “incoherent and confused”; (ii) D4 did not appreciate that amid the many communications from the Claimants the Claim Form had in fact been served; (iii) the documents attached to the email of service were sent by Google Drive link and in transmission the formatting had become “scrambled”; and (iv) D4 does not voluntarily accept service of legal proceedings by email. It was only on being served with the order of Steyn J, sealed on 5 November 2024, that D4 appreciated they needed English lawyers. On 13 November 2024 Ms Thomas’ firm was instructed and they acted promptly thereafter.
The Claimants responded to this application and evidence with the twelfth witness statement of C1, dated 20 December 2024, supported by a 94-page exhibit, XW12. This set out the detail of the Claimant’s dealings with D4 and their reasons for opposing the application.
C1’s evidence was that D4 is a corporate organisation with a well-established organisational structure, with independent teams handling legal matters, fraud and abuse. She explained that the Claimants had been communicating with D4’s various departments by email since June 2023, the salient features of which are as follows.
First, on 12 August 2023 a member of D4’s legal department in the United States, Sarah Knobloch, asked whether the Claimants’ “request” could be “localized to a court in United States jurisdiction”. The Claimants responded by explaining that they were bringing a claim in the “UK” jurisdiction, due to C2’s ill health and the fact that “the civil claim system is very convenient” due to the ability to submit documents to the court via the “E-filing system”. The Claimants provided links to the guidance available online about practice in the King’s Bench Division.
Second, when the claim was served on D4 on 22 September 2024, these were responded to by someone using the email address legal@porkbun.com (to which the Claimants had been advised to send legal documents), again asking if the matter could be localized to a court in United States jurisdiction. By this point, the Claimants had initiated proceedings in the United States, in the form of a petition filed in the United States District Court of Oregon on 29 August 2024. The documents relating to this claim were also served on D4 around this time.
Third, on 3 October 2024, some 11 days before the 14 October 2024 deadline, C1 emailed Ms Knobloch, highlighting that there was going to be a hearing in the King’s Bench Division in November 2024 and asking “would you like to file an Acknowledgement of Service for defence to the court on the claim KB-2023-003483?”. Ms Knobloch responded to this on 10 October 2024, saying “we would request that any legal documents be from a court with jurisdiction in Sherwood, Oregon, USA”. This position was reiterated on 16 October 2024. Steyn J’s 5 November 2024 order was served on D4 on the evening of 5 November 2024.
C1 contended that a member of D4’s external legal team in the United States, Marc Trachtenberg, refused to accept service of the subpoena that had been obtained in the Oregon proceedings and thus was not acting in good faith in trying to resolve the dispute.
Application of the Denton test to this case
The delay in filing the Acknowledgment of Service was a delay of 44 days. This was more than double the 22 days allowed by the Master and so must be regarded as “serious” within the first stage of the Denton test, albeit that I accept Ms Thomas’ evidence that it was not intentional.
As to whether the failing was significant, and why it occurred (under the second stage of the Denton test), the communications summarised at [37]-[39] show that the Claimants had tried to explain to D4’s legal department in the United States that they were bringing claims in this jurisdiction and why; and indeed had specifically alerted D4’s legal department to the imminent hearing in London and raised the issue of the possibility of them filing an Acknowledgement of Service on 3 October 2024. It is therefore, on the face of it, a little hard to follow why nothing was done to engage English lawyers until early November 2024.
However, I have some sympathy with the position D4’s legal department in the United States found itself in. The “slew of communications” from the Claimants described by Ms Thomas, their content, and the technical issues summarised at [34] chime with the manner in which the Claimants communicate with this court, as noted at [20] above. In my judgment they provide a substantial level of mitigation for the failure to identify that the claim had been served.
Further, the delay in filing the Acknowledgement of Service has had no impact on the conduct of the litigation as between the Claimants and D4: all the issues between them were the subject of argument in court a matter of weeks later, at the next listed hearing on 12 December 2024. For these reasons while the failing was serious, it has not proved in any way “significant” in the litigation.
As to other “circumstances of the case” under the third stage of the Denton test, it is relevant that: (i) the Claimants have been permitted significant latitude in the litigation so far, having obtained several extensions to the validity of the Claim Form as well as permission to serve by alternative means; and (ii) D4 have complied with all the other obligations on them in these proceedings.
It is also relevant that if this application is not granted, such that D4 is found to have submitted to the jurisdiction, D4 will proceed to make a summary judgment application based on the same arguments that feature in the jurisdiction challenge (namely the assertions that D4 is not a publisher at common law and not a web operator under s.13). I accept Mr Callus’ submission that the overriding objective is not furthered by duplicative applications, leading to an increase in delay and costs for all the parties, including the Claimants.
Conclusion on the Relief from Sanctions Application
For all these reasons I allow D4’s application for relief from sanctions. Time is retrospectively extended for D4 to file their Acknowledgment of Service. Accordingly it cannot be said that they have submitted to the jurisdiction or that they are precluded from advancing their jurisdiction challenge.
The Jurisdiction Applications
The legal principles relevant to jurisdiction
The court can only give permission to serve a claim on a defendant outside the jurisdiction if it is satisfied of three conditions: (i) there is a good arguable case that the claim is of a kind that falls within one of the “gateways” set out in CPR Practice Direction 6B (“the Gateway Requirement”); (ii) the claimant has a real as opposed to a fanciful prospect of success on the claim or, put another way, can show that any “reverse” summary judgment application made by the defendant would fail (“the Merits Test”); and (iii) England and Wales is the proper place in which to bring the claim” under CPR 6.37(3) (“the Forum Test”): Soriano v Forensic News [2022] QB 533 at [11].
A claimant seeking permission to serve outside the jurisdiction always bears the legal burden of proof on all these issues. That is the case whether the matter is being considered on an application by the claimant at the initial, without notice stage, or (as here) at the hearing of a subsequent application by the defendant to set aside an order permitting service outside the jurisdiction that was obtained without notice: Soriano at [12]. On an application of this kind the court considers the issue de novo or afresh, but the test is applied as at the date of the original grant of permission for service out: Golubovich v Golubovich [2022] EWHC 1605 (Ch) at [62]-[67].
The evidence relevant to the applications
D4 relied on the first witness statement from their solicitor Ms Thomas dated 27 November 2024, in which she described the various actors and roles in the existence of websites.
In summary, almost all websites are connected to domain names. A Domain Name Registrar is an accredited organisation permitted to sell or allocate certain sorts of domain names to third parties. Once a Domain Name Registrant has purchased a domain name they must take active steps to connect the domain name to the internet and to use it to host websites or email. They must contract with a Website Hosting Service for this purpose.
Ms Thomas explained that D4 is a Domain Name Registrar. The Domain Name Registrant registered the fishandchips.fans domain name using D4’s service. The domain name was used to direct web traffic to the http://fishandchips.fans website.
Like many other Domain Name Registrars, D4 also offers Website Hosting Services. However it does not do so in respect of the fishandchips.fans domain name. Accordingly, D4 has no control over, or non-public knowledge of, the use the domain name is put to, if any, including whether or not any specific content is posted on the domain name.
In response, and in support of their own application relating to jurisdiction, the Claimants relied on the eleventh witness statement of C1 dated 4 December 2024. This appeared to accept Ms Thomas’ description of D4’s role with respect to the fishandchips.fans domain name and the http://fishandchips.fans website, but made various legal submissions which I address below. The statement was supported by a 600-page exhibit, XW11. Part 2 of the exhibit included copies of the posts in question. Parts 1-7 comprised many hundreds of pages of correspondence between the Claimants and D4, with this court and with the court in Oregon.
In advance of the hearing the Claimants provided me separately with copies of communications they had had with D4’s Porkbun Fraud and Abuse Reporting Center in August 2022 in which D4 indicated that it would explore suspending the domain name.
The Claimants also relied on the second witness statement of C3 dated 9 December 2024. C3 explained that on 2 December 2024 the court in Oregon issued a subpoena and court order requiring D4 to disclose information relating to the posts on the http://fishandchips.fans website.
C3 also made allegations against Mr Trachtenberg, as C1 had done (see [40] above). He contended that Mr Trachtenberg had given contradictory accounts, at one point saying that D4 did not have information about people who may have posted on the http://fishandchips.fans website, nor did it have a way of obtaining that information; yet also saying if the Claimants wished D4 to disclose the identity of the Domain Name Registrant for the fishandchips.fans domain name, they would need to obtain a court order requiring D4 to do so.
Submissions and analysis
The Claimants advanced certain preliminary procedural objections to D4’s application challenging jurisdiction, as set out in C1’s eleventh witness statement.
First, they contended that there was no evidence in support of D4's application. That was plainly incorrect: D4 relied on Ms Thomas’ first witness statement.
Second, they relied on the fact that the Acknowledgement of Service had not been served on them by D4. However, CPR 10.1(3) and 10.4 make clear service is not required: it is sufficient that the Acknowledgment of Service is filed with the court, which then notifies a claimant of that fact.
Third, they relied on the fact that there was subject matter and territorial jurisdiction, in other words that they could satisfy the Gateway Requirement and the Forum Test. However, D4’s position was that there was no personal jurisdiction over D4, meaning that it solely focused on the Merits Test aspect of the Soriano requirements. Success on that ground for D4 would lead to success on the application overall.
D4 advanced the jurisdictional challenge under CPR Part 11 in two ways.
First, D4 contended that the Claimants could not prove it was the publisher of the words complained of at common law, such that the order permitting service out of the jurisdiction should be set aside as the Claimant could not satisfy the Merits Test (“the ‘publisher at common law’ ground”).
Second, D4 argued that as they were not the “author, editor or publisher” of the words complained of, s.10 of the 2013 meant that the court did not have jurisdiction over the defamation claim (“the section 10 ground”). Such jurisdiction challenges are to be taken by way of CPR Part 11 challenge: Mohammed v Daily The News International [2023] EWHC 674 (KB) at [18], applying Soriano at [52].
(i): The ‘publisher at common law’ ground
Relevant legal principles
The law of defamation distinguishes between different types of responsibility for a publication: see, for example, Monir v Wood [2018] EWHC 3525 (QB) from [133] to [194]. The “general rule” is that everyone “who knowingly takes part in the publication of a libel, or authorises or ratifies it” is jointly and severally liable: Monir at [135i)].
To be liable as a “primary publisher” a person must be shown to have “knowing involvement in the publication of the particular words”. It is insufficient that a person “merely plays a passive role in the process”: Monir at [135ii)], citing Bunt v Tilley [2007] 1 WLR 1243 at [22]-[23]. Accordingly, an author, co-author, editor or printer could be a primary publisher; but a newsagent selling defamatory copies of a newspaper, or the distributor of a magazine, could be liable for publication as a secondary publisher.
A secondary publisher, but not a primary publisher, can invoke the common law defence of “innocent dissemination” if they show they: (a) did not know of the defamatory statement; (b) had no reason to know of the defamatory statement; and (c) their ignorance was not founded on negligence.
The law in this area overlaps with that relating to “subsequent ratification”, arising from Byrne v Deane [1937] 1 KB 818. This applies so that where a third party publishes material via a medium over which the defendant has control, the defendant can become liable for the publication if, in all the circumstances, it can be inferred from the defendant’s failure to remove the defamatory material that the defendant “acquiesced in or authorised the continued publication”: Monir at [175]. A defendant held liable on this basis is liable as a primary, not secondary, publisher: Monir at [176]. This is because, effectively, the publisher has, with knowledge of the defamatory statements, actively chosen to continue publication thus allowing the inference of authorisation or acquiescence as if they were the original publisher.
The fundamental distinction between a primary and secondary publisher is “knowledge that a publication contains some defamatory matter and the ability to control its publication or continued publication”: Monir at [178] [emphasis in the original].
Submissions and analysis
The Particulars of Claim do not contend that D4 had written the posts in question or edited them. Rather, the Claimants’ case is that D4 was liable because D1’s posts were on a site for which D4 was responsible and which it had failed to correct.
However, Ms Thomas’s evidence shows that D4 was merely the Domain Name Registrar and does not host or operate the https://fishandchips.fans website. It has a merely passive role in registering domain names that direct web traffic. It did not transmit the defamatory statements complained of. At the date of the original grant of permission to serve out, D4 had neither the knowledge nor the control over the content to make it either a primary or secondary publisher at common law.
D4’s position in this regard was supported by the case law. Mr Callus and his junior had not been able to find any case in which it had been argued that a Domain Name Registrar, who was not also hosting material, is responsible for publication on a website whose domain name it had registered. However, he relied on cases involving other participants in the website process, including Bunt v Tilley [2007] 1 WLR 1243 and Metropolitan Schools International v DesignTechnica [2011] 1 WLR 1743. These illustrate that even passive, non-hosting Internet Service Providers and search engines that automatically publish snippets are mere “facilitators” and not publishers at common law. On that basis a Domain Name Registrar who does not host or operate the website complained of cannot possibly be a publisher, primary or secondary and whether or not on notice, at common law.
The Claimants did not suggest that Ms Thomas’ evidence was wrong. They accepted that D4 was a Domain Name Registrar. Beyond that, I confess I found their case hard to follow. As far as I understand it, their case was as follows.
First, the Claimants submitted that D4 was the operator of the https://fishandchips.fans website. Indeed in oral submissions C1 argued that D4 was both an “operator and a distributor”. However, Ms Thomas’s evidence shows that that is factually incorrect: D4’s role was limited to that of a Domain Name Registrar.
Second, C1 asserted in her eleventh witness statement that as a matter of law a website operator “assumes the roles of “author”, “editor” and “publisher” under the Defamation Act 1996 (“the 1996 Act”). She contended that the 2013 Act had established “a more open model” by which the definition of “operator” of a website embraces the six separate roles of “author”, “IP”, “domain”, “host”, “administrator” and “webmaster”. She maintained this in her oral submissions, arguing that the 2013 Act adopted a “very open definition”. This meant that those involved in the domain name, the publisher and the editor were all equal in terms of liability. The same was true, she argued, of the administrators, support staff, service providers and communication company.
C3 took a similar approach in oral submissions. He confirmed that there was no disagreement between the Claimants and D4 in terms of the technicalities. However, he contended that it is important to understand how the internet works: a Domain Name Registrar performs an essential role, in that without the domain names they sell, it would be impossible to access the internet. There is a “lack of definitions” in the legislation and a “very open” definition should be adopted to the meaning of “publisher” or “operator”.
I do not accept that any of these statements properly summarise the law. It is clear that both the common law and the statutory framework have specifically delineated the different roles in the website process, for good reasons: see [65]-[69] above and [83]-[84] below. There are plenty of definitions, and the position is very far from “open” or fluid in the way C1 and C3 suggested.
Third, the Claimants argued that because D4 had suggested in correspondence that it might be able to deregister the domain name this was evidence of control over the content on the website. In her oral submissions, C1 posed the question “if they are not the operator of the website, why are they in a position to suspend the domain?”.
However, this submission reflects a failure to take into account Ms Thomas’ evidence about the different roles of those involved in the website process, and D4’s limited role as a Domain Name Registrar: all D4 can do is deregister the domain name so the whole site becomes impossible to find. It has no control over the content on the site. Mr Callus offered an analogy of defamatory comments posted on YouTube. The Domain Name Registrar would only be able to suspend the whole of YouTube, not delete the individual comments.
In light of Ms Thomas’ evidence and my rejection of the Claimants’ arguments at [74]-[79] above, the Claimants do not have a case capable of withstanding an application for reverse summary judgment that D4 was responsible as the publisher of the allegedly defamatory statements at common law. The same is true of their assertion, to the extent that it is made, that D4 was itself directly responsible for any malicious falsehood or breach of privacy.
Accordingly, the Claimants cannot establish the requisite case to meet the merits test for service out under CPR 6.37. D4 is therefore entitled to the declaration of non-jurisdiction it seeks in the CPR Part 11 application and the 24 October 2023 order granting permission to serve the Claim Form on D4 out of the jurisdiction must therefore be set aside.
(ii): The section 10 ground
Relevant statutory provisions
The 2013 Act, s.10 provides as follows
Action against a person who was not the author, editor etc
A court does not have jurisdiction to hear and determine an action for defamation brought against a person who was not the author, editor or publisher of the statement complained of unless the court is satisfied that it is not reasonably practicable for an action to be brought against the author, editor or publisher.
For the purposes of s.10(1), “author” means “the originator of the statement, but does not include a person who did not intend that his statement be published at all”; “editor” means “a person having editorial or equivalent responsibility for the content of the statement or the decision to publish it”; and “publisher” means “a commercial publisher, that is, a person whose business is issuing material to the public, or a section of the public, who issues material containing the statement in the course of that business”: see s.10(2), which incorporates the definitions in the 1996 Act, s.1(2).
Further, by the 1996 Act s.1(3)(e) a person shall not be considered the author, editor or publisher of a statement if he is only involved as “the operator of or provider of access to a communications system by means of which the statement is transmitted, or made available, by a person over whom he has no effective control”.
Submissions and analysis
Ms Thomas’ evidence as summarised at [50]-[53] above shows that D4 is a Domain Name Registrar which does not host or operate a website. Accordingly it is not an author, editor or publisher within the wording of the applicable definitions set out at [83] above. However if there was any doubt about this, the exclusion in s.1(3)(e) confirms the position. D4, as a Domain Name Registrar, is therefore within the first part of s.10(1).
On that basis, the next question is whether, under the second part of s.10(1), the court can be satisfied that it is not reasonably practicable for the Claimants to bring a claim against the author, editor or publisher. That question must be answered in the negative here, because the Claimants have not only been able to bring a claim against the author/publisher of the posts, D1, but have obtained default judgment against him on their defamation and other claims. On that basis s.10 provides that the court does not have jurisdiction.
In submissions, C3 argued that there may have been authors/publishers other than D1. The posts complained of on https://fishandchips.fans appear to have come from four usernames; and accordingly the Claimants could not rule out D1 having worked with “additional accomplices”. Although this point was the subject of limited argument, I consider that it provides the Claimants with limited assistance for the following reasons.
First, the Claimants’ Particulars of Claim acknowledge that there were multiple accounts involved in the posts but contend at paragraph 23(3) that D1 was responsible for them all. They have obtained default judgment against D1 on that case. Accordingly, it is no longer open to D1 to argue that he was not responsible for all the posts (if indeed that was ever his case). Rather, the court will make what orders as to remedy are appropriate against D1 on the basis that he was responsible for them all.
Second, I am doubtful that the proper interpretation of s.10 is that to the effect that the court must be satisfied that it is not reasonably practicable for an action to be brought against all potential authors, editors or publishers in circumstances where one such person has not only been successfully sued but where judgment has been obtained against them.
Third, even if the s.10 issue is not resolved in D4’s favour, their success on the ‘publisher at common law’ issue above is sufficient for their jurisdiction challenge to succeed overall.
Conclusion on the Jurisdiction Applications
For all these reasons D4’s jurisdiction application dated 27 November 2024 succeeds. D4 is entitled to declarations of non-jurisdiction under CPR 11(1) and consequential relief in the form of an order setting aside service of the Claim Form under CPR 11(6). It follows that the Claimants’ application dated 5 December 2024 is dismissed. It was, in any event, unnecessary: the Claimants could merely have filed evidence in response to D4’s application and made submissions to the effect that the application should not only be dismissed but was totally without merit.
The Section 13 Application
Relevant statutory provisions
The 2013 Act, s.13 provides as follows:
Order to remove statement or cease distribution etc
Where a court gives judgment for the claimant in an action for defamation the court may order –
the operator of a website on which the defamatory statement is posted to remove the statement, or
any person who was not the author, editor or publisher of the defamatory statement
to stop distributing, selling or exhibiting material containing the statement”.
The 2013 Act, s.5 introduced a new defence for operators of websites, to reflect the fact that many people were operating websites where third parties were able to post statements. Under s.5(2) it is a defence for the operator to show that they had not themselves posted the statement. However, under s.5(3) the defence is defeated if the claimant shows that it was not possible to identify the third party who posted the statement; that they sent a notice to the operator; and that the operator failed to respond to the notice in line with regulations. Under ss.5(11)-(12), the defence is also defeated by the operator’s malice, but not merely on the basis that the operator moderates comments.
Submissions and analysis
The court has given judgment for the Claimants in their action for defamation against D1. However, D4 contended that an order under s.13 could not be made against it for the following reasons.
First, as far as s.13(1)(a) is concerned, if a person is not the “operator of a website” theoretically able to enjoy a defence under s.5, they will not be an “operator of a website” for the purposes of s.13. Website operators are those with some editorial or hosting control over the contents of a particular website. This could be, for example, a Domain Name Registrant or a web hosting service that has been put on notice of the defamatory words, or some other person who is capable of identifying the actual author of the words on the website, so as to avail themselves of the defence set out in the 2013 Act, s.5.
However, here, D4 has no such editorial or hosting control over the contents of the https://fishandchips.fans website, for the reasons given in Ms Thomas’s first witness statement. As the Domain Name Registrar only, D4 has no ability to identify the poster of the defamatory statements on the website, let alone the power to remove the defamatory material. D4 could never avail itself of the s.5 defence and so cannot be the subject of an order under s.13(1)(a).
Accordingly this case is to be distinguished from those where orders under s.13(1)(a) have been made against website operators, such as Summerfield Brown Ltd v Waymouth [2021] EWHC 85 (QB) (regarding the Trustpilot site) Blackledge v Persons Unknown [2021] EWHC 1994 (QB) (regarding Google LLC, in its capacity as the operator of blogspot.com), Dudley v Phillips [2022] EWHC 930 (QB) (regarding Consumer Opinion LLC, the operator of www.pissedconsumer.com); and Northcott v Hundeyin [2024] EWHC 2704 (KB) (regarding Substack and X, formerly Twitter).
Second, although it appears that an order under s.13(1)(b) is yet to be made by the courts, it would seem that it is intended to apply to secondary publishers at common law. This interpretation is consistent with the observation made by the authors of Gatley on Libel & Slander (13th edition, 2022) at paragraph 10-047 to the effect that the enactment of s.13 was complementary to the enactment of ss.5 and 10, to ensure that a claimant is not deprived of an effective remedy. As set out at [66]-[69] above, a secondary publisher is someone who participates in publication with both knowledge of, and control over, the defamatory statement’s continued publication. That does not apply to D4 who lacks such knowedge and control.
This much is made clear by the language of s.13(1)(b): D4 is not currently “distributing, selling or exhibiting material containing the statement” and so cannot be ordered to cease so doing.
For these reasons I accept D4’s submission that it would not be rational or appropriate to exercise the court’s discretion to make any s.13 order against D4.
Conclusion on the Section 13 Application
The Section 13 Application was made within the currency of these proceedings against D4 as a defendant on the Claim Form, and both were served out on the basis of Master Stevens’ 23 October 2023 order granting permission to serve the Claim Form on D4 out of the jurisdiction. I have decided that that order must be set aside for the reasons given at [48]-[91] above.
However, even if the court does have jurisdiction, a s.13 order would not be appropriate on the merits, for the reasons given at [95]-[100] above.
The Part 18 Application
Under CPR 18.1(1), the court may at any time order a party to (a) clarify any matter which is in dispute in the proceedings; or (b) give additional information in relation to any such matter, whether or not the matter is contained or referred to in a statement of case.
The Claimants’ Part 18 Application was made within the currency of these proceedings against D4 and so the court has no jurisdiction to determine it, in light of the setting aside of the order granting permission to serve the Claim Form on D4 out of the jurisdiction.
However, even if the court did have jurisdiction, a Part 18 order would not be appropriate on the merits.
This application seeks “any and all” information from D4 that could lead to the identification of the “poster” of the defamatory material. For the reasons given in Ms Thomas’ first statement, D4 does not have the power to identify the “poster” such that an order of this kind would serve no purpose and should not be made.
C1 contended that D4 did know who the posters of the information were and that one of D4’s American legal advisers had told C3 that. That is inconsistent with Ms Thomas’ evidence. C1’s submission may reflect a misunderstanding of the fact that D4 presumably knows the identity of the Domain Name Registrant, having sold the Domain Name to them, and C3 having been told that D4 could investigate suspending the Domain Name.
The Claimants also relied on the third witness statement of C3 dated 2 January 2025. The Claimants had no permission to file this statement but D4 has not raised an objection to it being taken into account, and I am content to do so.
In this statement C3 sought to reframe the Part 18 Application as, in fact, an application against a non-party to compel the disclosure of the identity of a wrongdoer so that proceedings may be brought against the proper defendant, applying the principles in Norwich Pharmacal v Customs and Excise Commissioners [1974] AC 133 at 175. C3 argued that the application extended to the three users of the http://fishandchips.fans website other than D1, again making the point that the Claimants “do not have conclusive evidence to determine that all the posts were published by D1”.
To re-interpret a Part 18 application as a Norwich Pharmacal one, and to change the nature of the material sought from one poster to “all posters”, requires a very generous interpretation to the application. However, even if the Claimants were permitted that procedural latitude, the answer would still be the same: D4 simply has no power to identify who posted the material in question, however many people were involved.
C3 also alluded to an argument that the application should be re-interpreted even more generously to be considered as one to seek disclosure of the Domain Name Registrant, with a view to seeing if they could assist in identifying who was directly responsible for the posts. As to this, as Ms Thomas explained in her first witness statement, it appears that the Domain Name Registrant merely posted a social media site on the domain name for others to post comments on and engage in conversations on. She therefore contended that it seems very unlikely that details about the Domain Name Registrant would inform the Claimants in any material way as to who was posting material about them on the website.
In addition, any order aimed at assisting the Claimants in identifying any additional posters of the defamatory material over and above D1 would have limited utility given that default judgment has been obtained against him, on the basis of the Claimants’ pleaded case that he was the sole author or publisher. As noted at [88] above, an appropriate order on remedy will be made on that basis. It is therefore hard to see what purpose any fresh claims by the Claimants against further individuals would achieve. That is a further factor militating against making either a Part 18 or Norwich Pharmacal order against D4.
Summary of the outcome of the Applications
Accordingly, for all these reasons, I:
Allow D4’s Relief from Sanctions Application;
Allow D4’s application dated 27 November 2024 challenging jurisdiction under CPR Part 11;
Dismiss the Claimants’ application dated 5 December 2024 to dismiss D4’s CPR Part 11 application as being totally without merit;
Dismiss the Claimants’ Section 13 Application against D4; and
Dismiss the Claimants’ Part 18 Application against D4.
Costs
Whether to make a costs order and if so what order to make
As the successful party on the applications, D4 sought an order that the Claimants pay their costs, in accordance with the general rule in CPR 44.2(2)(a) to the effect that the unsuccessful party will be ordered to pay the costs of the successful party.
The Claimants opposed this course and sought a different order from one in accordance with the general rule, under CPR 44.2(2)(b). Their primary position was that no order for costs should be made, meaning either party would bear their own costs in full. Alternatively, they argued that they should only be ordered to pay a nominal element of D4’s costs.
Under CPR 44.2(4), in deciding what order (if any) to make about costs, the court will have regard to all the circumstances, including (a) the conduct of all the parties and (c) any admissible offer to settle made by a party which is drawn to the court’s attention, and which is not an offer to which costs consequences under Part 36 apply.
As to (a), the Claimants argued that D4’s jurisdiction challenge was procedurally defective and substantively lacking merit. The Claimants were right to highlight the delay in D4 filing their Acknowledgment of Service but that was remedied by the application for relief from sanctions, which the Claimants strenuously opposed and lost. I consider that the jurisdiction challenge did have merit, for the reasons given above.
The Claimants contended that D4’s conduct has “unnecessarily burdened” the Claimants and the court and “unnecessarily increased costs”. I cannot accept that submission. D4 has, in my overall assessment, responded promptly and efficiently to the applications and provided effective and proportionate assistance to the court. The descriptions used by the Claimants in this respect are more apposite to their own conduct, as noted at [20] above. The Claimants’ conduct has undoubtedly increased costs to D4. It also makes allotting to the case “an appropriate share of the court’s resources, while taking into account the need to allot resources to other cases” challenging. This is a relevant factor as part of the overriding objective under CPR 1.1(2)(e).
D4 relied on the fact that on 20 November 2024, before making their CPR Part 11 application, D4 wrote to the Claimants setting out their position on the jurisdiction issues in detail and offering not to pursue the Claimants for their costs if they discontinued the claim against D4. The Claimants responded by filing their counter-application dated 5 December 2024, supported by voluminous evidence, and fully contested the application at the hearing and in further submissions and evidence filed after it. D4’s 20 November 2024 letter constitutes an admissible offer to settle which is relevant to the costs discretion under CPR 44.2(4)(c).
Moreover I was shown correspondence indicating that as long ago as 9 April 2024, the limits of D4’s role as a Domain Name Registrant were explained to C3: he was told in terms “we don’t have the ability to remove specific content from the site”.
For these reasons, application of both CPR 44.2(4)(a) and (c) militate in favour of applying the general rule and thus support the making of a costs order in D4’s favour. In light of these two factors, and considering all the circumstances of the case, I order that the Claimants shall pay D4’s costs of these applications, to be assessed on a standard basis.
The level of costs
Under CPR 44.3(2), where the amount of costs is to be assessed on the standard basis, the court will only allow costs which are proportionate to the matters in issue. Costs which are disproportionate in amount may be disallowed or reduced even if they were reasonably or necessarily incurred.
D4’s costs schedule sought £58,185.50. The Claimants did not advance any arguments about the detail of the costs sought but the figure is, on any view, high, for work done in just over a month and for a one-day hearing.
However the figure sought reflects the time taken to understand the complex procedural history of the case; correspondence with the Claimants including the attempt to settle matters by the 20 November 2024 letter; the work needed to prepare the 27 November 2024 application once it became clear that the Claimants would not accept the 20 November 2024 offer; the drafting of a chronology and a detailed skeleton argument by counsel; the preparation of a properly indexed bundle of authorities; and the hearing itself. Only certain work was done by a Grade A fee earner; otherwise it was done by a Grade C fee earner. The instruction of specialist counsel was appropriate and proportionate given the complexities of the issues before the court.
It is also relevant that the Claimants’ claim form seeks £950,000 in damages, and contends that D2, D3 and D4 should share responsibility for payment of this sum with D1.
Overall, I consider that D4’s costs as claimed were proportionate to the matters in issue. The work done by D4 in respect of these applications has had the effect of bringing to an end the entirety of the case against D4, thus saving costs for the future. I do not consider that any individual item of the costs incurred was unreasonably or unnecessarily incurred or that any are otherwise disproportionate in amount.
Accordingly, I summarily assess D4’s costs in the sum of £58,185.50. That is the amount the Claimants will have to pay D4.
Time to pay
Under CPR 44.7(1)(a) a party must comply with an order for the payment of costs within 14 days of the date of the judgment or order which states the amount of those costs, unless under CPR 44.7(1)(c) the court specifies another date.
The Claimants sought an extension of time for them to pay any costs order against D4 until such time as their claims against the other Defendants had been resolved. Presumably their hope is to meet any costs order against D4 with damages awarded against the other Defendants.
While in some circumstances the court might be persuaded to “set off” costs and damages between the same parties, I do not consider that the same approach should apply here. I am not persuaded, as a point of principle, that it is fair to deny D4 their costs until such time as a damages award is made against D1, D2 or D3 and that those damages are paid to the Claimants.
Further, the Claimants have not yet established any liability against D2 and D3 and are some way off doing so: they are still engaged in interlocutory applications and D3 has applied to strike out the claim against them. The Claimants have obtained judgment in default against D1, and it is anticipated that the disposal hearing in respect of that claim will take place in the next few months. Accordingly, a judgment after that hearing is in reasonable contemplation. However, there is no way of knowing whether D1 will meet any award of damages made against him. His lack of engagement with the litigation so far suggests he might not.
The Claimants also argued that having to pay costs now would deprive them of the resources necessary to pursue their claims against the other Defendants, contravening the principles of fairness and access to justice enshrined in the overriding objective. With respect, I cannot see that it will: as the Claimants represent themselves, they are not paying lawyers. To the extent that they need to pay court fees in respect of applications and the like, that has not dissuaded them from making a vast number of applications. Financial help with court fees is available for those of very limited means, though it does not appear that the Claimants require this.
The Claimants implied that they did not have the means to pay any immediate costs order, stating that their limited financial means explained why they were representing themselves. The Particulars of Claim pleads that they own three properties. While of course property ownership is not the same as access to liquid assets, the Claimants provided no evidence of their wider financial position. In any event, a person’s means are not necessarily a reason for not making a costs order against them: this is not a specific factor to which the court must have regard in exercising its discretion under CPR 44. The courts are regularly required to make costs orders against those of modest means, if correct application of the principles in CPR 44 requires that.
That said, I am conscious that this is, as far as I am aware, the first adverse costs order that has been made against the Claimants, and that it is for a significant amount. I indicated in the draft of this judgment that I was prepared to extend the time for the payment of D4’s costs to 28 days, under CPR 44.7(1)(c).
In responding to the draft judgment, the Claimants asked for the hand down of the judgment to be delayed for a week due to it being the Chinese New Year until 4 February 2025. They made it clear that they sought the additional time to assist them in making arrangements to comply with the costs order.
While it was not appropriate to delay the hand down of the judgment, I am content to grant the Claimants an additional week to pay the costs. D4 agreed to this course. Accordingly, the time for the Claimants to pay D4’s costs is extended to 35 days, under CPR 44.7(1)(c).
Conclusion
Accordingly, for all these reasons, I allow both of D4’s applications; dismiss the Claimants’ three applications; and order the Claimants to pay D4’s costs in the sum of £58,185.50 within 35 days of the date of my order. Accordingly the costs must be paid by 4.30 pm GMT on 7 March 2025.
(Footnote reference from: 1)  These are described at p.65 of the Particulars of Claim as “misuse of private [information] and breach of privacy” and “misuse of personal data and breach of privacy”. It is also alleged that D1 has engaged in conduct in breach of Article 8 and 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights.
(Footnote reference from: 2)  The Claimants have incorporated over 300 posts into paragraphs 34-343 of their Particulars of Claim, albeit that paragraph 28(3) avers that there were over 840 posts in relation to C3 alone. At paragraph 5 of her eleventh witness statement, C1 averred that there were over 1,000 posts.
